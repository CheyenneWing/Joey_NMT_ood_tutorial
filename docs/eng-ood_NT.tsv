1CO01:2	It is sent to the church of God in Corinth, those who are being made right in Christ Jesus, called to live holy lives—and to everyone who worships the Lord Jesus Christ everywhere, the Lord both of them and of us.

1CO01:7	so that you're not missing any spiritual gift as you wait for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.  	Kum wehs ab i neid g hoꞌigeꞌidadgaj ch ep nenida mat ep wo jiwia.  
1CO01:8-9	He will also keep you strong to the very end, so you will be kept right until the day of the Lord Jesus Christ.  God is trustworthy who called you to share together in fellowship with his son Jesus Christ our Lord. 	Jiosh at ab i em-waid k ab i em-gawulkai mat hab masma hab t-juh.

1CO01:10	Brothers and sisters, I plead with you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all agree and that you're not divided. Instead develop a united attitude and purpose.  	T-kownalig Jesus Christ o ab ni-mahkch g gewkdag mant wo haꞌichu em-cheha. Kunt hekaj wo em-ahgi mamt pi ab hu e wui wo gegokiwua k wabshaba ab wo i hemakoj g e-chegitoidag k wo s-ap e tahtkk ab aꞌai e wui. 
1CO01:11	For I have been told things about you, my brothers and sisters, by some of Chloe's people—that you are quarreling among yourselves.  	Ia at haꞌi dada g em-wehm kihkam mo d Cloe hajuni k hab kaij mamsh pi e wehm neneok.  
1CO01:12	Let me explain what I mean. You're all making different claims: “I follow Paul,” or “I follow Apollos,” or “I follow Peter,” or “I follow Christ.”  	Haꞌi amsh hab kaij mamsh ahni am ni-oid ch amsh haꞌi g Apollos am oid ch amsh haꞌi g Peter am oid. Kumsh haꞌi hab e elid mamsh ahpim d waꞌi wohokam oiddam g Christ. 
1CO01:13	Is Christ divided? Did Paul die on a cross for you? Was it in the name of Paul that you were baptized? 	Neh, am amtsh aꞌai i e gaꞌagwulkad k eda d chum hemako ab wecho g Christ. Pi att hema ahchim ab muh kots t ab em wehhejed. Heg at waꞌi Christ hab e juh. Kumt heg ab waꞌi s-wohochud k e pahl wapko. 
1CO01:14-17	I'm grateful to God that I didn't baptize any of you, except Crispus and Gaius,  so nobody can claim they were baptized in my name.  (Oh, and I also baptized the Stephanas family—I can't think of anyone else.)  For Christ didn't send me out to baptize, but to spread the good news, and not with eloquent human wisdom, otherwise the cross of Christ would be made powerless. 	Pi ant heg wehhejed am hu jiwia manis wehs wo em-pahl wapko. Shahag wepo mant hegam waꞌi Crispus ch Gaius ha wapko, pej hegam ehp Stephanus. Pi ant chegito manis haꞌi ep ha pahl wapko.

Neh, id ani waꞌi ahgachug ch pi hekaj g s-hasig neꞌoki mams ab wo si has ni-elid k p i am hu wo amichud k hab pi wo e doꞌibia. 
1CO01:18	For the message of the cross is nonsense to those who are lost, but it's the power of God to those of us who are saved.  	Hegam mo pi d e doꞌibiakam o hab elid mo d wabsh pi haꞌichu g haꞌichu t-ahga mat g Christ ab muh kots t ab t-wehhejed. Kuch wabshaba ahchim mach d t-doꞌibiakam s-mahch mo g Jiosh hab masma ab t-chehgidch g e-gewkdag.  
1CO01:19	As Scripture says, “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and I will wipe out the cleverness of the clever.” 	Neh, an o oꞌohanas mo hab kaij g Jiosh: 
1CO01:20	So how about the wise, the writers, and the philosophers of this age? Hasn't God turned the wisdom of this world into foolishness?  	Pegih, am o t‑chehgidch g Jiosh matt pi hedai wo shaꞌi t‑nako machs wo hejel t‑doꞌibia, chum achs hems haꞌichu wo s‑amichudad ch haꞌichu wo s‑mahchkad. Pi att hedai wo shaꞌi t‑nako machs wo ha neꞌowin k wo cheh g Jiosh wohokam.  
1CO01:21	Since God in his wisdom allowed the world in its wisdom not to know God, it was God's gracious plan that by the foolishness of the good news those who trusted in him would be saved.  	Jiosh at hab masma hab t‑juh matt pi hedai wo shaꞌi t‑nako machs hejel wo s‑mai g Jiosh k wo t‑doꞌibia. Haꞌi o pi haꞌichuchud g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. K wabshaba hab d elidaj matt ab wo i s‑wohoch g haꞌichu ahgaj k hekaj wo t‑doꞌibia.  
1CO01:22	The Jews ask for miraculous signs, and Greeks look for wisdom,  	Ni‑wehm Tutuligo o s‑hohhoꞌid mat hoꞌip nei g s‑hasig haꞌichu k haha wo s‑wohoch hegai mo hab junihim. K g gawul mahs hemajkam s‑kaimk g hemajkam haꞌichu ha‑mahchig mat hab masma wo chum s‑mai g wohokam.  
1CO01:23	but our message is of Christ killed on a cross—offensive to the Jews, and foolishness to the foreigners.  	Ch wabshaba ahchim hi heg ahgachug mat g Christ ab muh kots t ab k hekaj t‑doꞌibia. Tutuligo o hab elid mo id wabsh chehgidch mo pi gewkdag. K g gawul mahs oꞌodham hab elid mo wabsh chehgidch mo pi haꞌichu amichud.  
1CO01:24-25	However for those who are called by God, both Jews and foreigners, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.  For the foolishness of God is wiser than we are; and the weakness of God is stronger than we are. 	T wabshaba g Jiosh ab haꞌi i t‑gawulkai ahchim Tutuligo k hab waꞌap ab haꞌi i em‑gawulkai ahpim gawul mahs hemajkam matt ab wo i s‑wohoch g alidag k wo t‑doꞌibia.

1CO01:26	Brothers and sisters, remember your calling—and that this did not include many who are wise, humanly speaking; not many who are powerful; not many who are important.  	Am g wo s‑chegitok, ni‑wepnag, mam has i masma mat eda koi ab hu i em‑gawulkai g Jiosh mamt d wo hemajkamgajk, Muꞌijj am pi haꞌichu mahch ch pi ha gewkdag ch d wabsh pi haꞌichu am ha‑nena ed g hemajkam.  
1CO01:27	Instead God chose the things the world considers foolish to humiliate those who think they are wise. He chose the things the world considers weak to humiliate those who think they are strong.  	T g Jiosh ab i em‑gawulkai mat hekaj am wo ha chehgi hegam mo pi mahch mo d wabsh pi haꞌichu g haꞌichu ha‑amichudadag ch ha‑gewkdag.  
1CO01:28	He chose the things that are unimportant and despised by the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing the things that are, 	Pi am ab hu em‑haꞌichuchud ch wabsh s‑em‑uhwaid. T wabshaba g Jiosh ab i em‑gawulkai mat hekaj am wo ha chehgi mo pi d shaꞌi haꞌichu hegam mo g hemajkam ab si has ha elid.  
1CO01:29	so that nobody should boast in God's presence. 	Heg o hekaj hab mahs mat pi hedai wo chum si e haschudad am tahgio g Jiosh.  
1CO01:30	It's because of him that you live in Christ Jesus, who God made to be wisdom for us. He sets us right, keeps us right, and frees us.  	Heg at ab i t‑wehnad g Christ matt ab i s‑wohoch g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahga ab amjed. T g Christ t‑doꞌibia ab amjed g pi apꞌekam k am i t‑apꞌech wehhejed g Jiosh matt d wo hekia s‑apꞌekam hemajkamgajk, Bo masma ab t‑chehgidch g Jiosh haꞌichu amichudadag.  
1CO01:31	So as Scripture says, “Whoever wants to boast, let them boast in the Lord.” 	Heg o hekaj an hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed: 
1CO02:1	Brothers and sisters, when I came to you I didn't try to impress you with wonderful words or great wisdom when I told you what God had to say to you.  	Kuni ahni hi pi shaꞌi hasigamkaj neok, ni‑wepnag, mant eda am wa jiwia em‑wui am ahgachugch  
1CO02:2	I decided that while I was with you I didn't want to concentrate on anything except Jesus Christ, and that he was crucified.  	mat g Jesus Christ ab muh kots t ab am t‑wehhejed. Kuni hab n‑ahg mant heg am wo waꞌi ahgachugad  
1CO02:3	I came to you in weakness, fearful and trembling.  	ch heg hekaj si s‑gihug ch gigiwuk.  
1CO02:4	I didn't speak to you with persuasive words of wisdom to convince you. I just explained it all to you through the evidence and power of the Spirit.  	K g haꞌichu ni‑ahga pi am hu hab shaꞌi kaidag matp hems g si s‑e mahchim oꞌodham haꞌichu ahga. K wabshaba g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag am wohokamchud g haꞌichu ni‑ahga.  
1CO02:5	That way your trust in God wouldn't rely on human wisdom but on the power of God. 	Heg ani hekaj s‑mahch mo g em‑wohochudadag pi ab hu shon heg ab hemajkam haꞌichu amichudadag ch wabshaba ab Jiosh gewkdag amjed. 
1CO02:6	However we do use words of wisdom when we speak to those who are spiritually mature, but this isn't wisdom that comes from this world, or from the rulers of this world who soon fade from the scene.  	Am ani wa hi wa ha ahgid g haꞌichu amichudadag hegam mat geꞌegeꞌehogat e‑wohochudadag ed. K wabshaba id pi d hemajkam haꞌichu ha‑amichudadag, chum hems hegam mo d s‑has hahaꞌichu. Hegam haꞌichu ha‑amichudadag at wabsh ha wehm wo huhug.  
1CO02:7	On the contrary we explain God's wisdom in terms of a revealed mystery that was previously hidden which God planned for our glory before the creation of the worlds. 	Ihda haꞌichu amichudadag mani hab ahg o d Jiosh hab elida am t‑wehhejed ch an hab chuꞌig mat koi in hu nahto ihda jewed ch wabsh s‑aꞌagi an hab ah chuꞌig. Do Jiosh hab elida mat g Christ wo t‑doꞌibia.  
1CO02:8	None of the rulers of this world understood anything about this—for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.  	Heg o d kownal wehs haꞌichu dahm. T eda g s‑has hahaꞌichu ab naggia kots t ab no pi pi mahch g Jiosh hab elida.  
1CO02:9	But as Scripture says, “No one has ever seen, and no one has ever heard, and no one has ever imagined what God has prepared for those who love him.”  	An o hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed: 
1CO02:10	But God has revealed this to us through the Spirit, because the Spirit delves into the depths of God.  	Jiosh haꞌichu hab elida o pi ta machima am t‑wehhejed. K wabshaba g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag wehs s‑mahch ch am i t‑tashogid.  
1CO02:11	Who knows anyone's thoughts except the actual person?  In the same way no one knows God's thoughts except the Spirit of God.  	Neh, no hig pi woho mo pi hedai ep s‑mahch g haꞌichu t‑chegitoi hab masma mach ahchim hejel s‑mahch? Pegih, ch ahchim hab wa masma pi hedai ep s‑mahch g Jiosh haꞌichu chegitoi.  
1CO02:12	For we have received the Spirit from God, not the spirit of this world, so that we could understand what God so generously gave us.  	T wabshaba g Jiosh ab t‑mah g Hekai S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag mat am t‑eda wo ulinig ch am wo i t‑tashogidad mo haschu ab t‑makiog g Jiosh. 
1CO02:13	That's what we speak about—not using words taught by human wisdom, but what the Spirit teaches. We explain what is spiritual using spiritual terms.  	Pegih, pi att wo shaꞌi t‑nako machs am hu wo tashogi g Jiosh wohokam heg hekaj hemajkam haꞌichu amichudadag. K wabshaba g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ab t‑mahkch g haꞌichu amichudadag mach hekaj am i tashogid. T hegam wo waꞌi s‑amich mo hedai edgid g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag.  
1CO02:14	Of course people who are not spiritual don't accept what comes from God's Spirit. It's just foolish nonsense to them, and they can't understand it, because what is spiritual has to be properly examined.  	T hegam mo pi edgid pi wo amichud k pi wo bei mo haschu ab t‑makiog. Heg waꞌi Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag o ab t‑mahkch g amichudadag matt wo s‑amich g wohokam.  
1CO02:15	People who are spiritual investigate everything, but are not placed under investigation themselves.  	Ahchim mach edgid g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag att wo t‑nako matt am s‑ap wo i aꞌamich mo haschu am i t‑tashogidch. K hegam pi t‑amichud matp hedai i pi edgid g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. 
1CO02:16	For “Who understands the Lord's mind, and would think to instruct him?” But we <span class="it">do</span> have Christ's mind! 	Id o hab ahg hegai mo an Jiosh t amjed oꞌohanas: 
1CO03:1	My brothers and sisters, I couldn't talk with you as spiritual believers, but as worldly people—like baby Christians.  	Am ani wa pi hasigam neok, ni‑wepnag, mani am em‑ahgid g wohokam namt pi pi koi geꞌegeꞌehogat id eda t‑wohochudadag ch pi am hu si e dagitokch Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag wui. Bam waꞌi masma mo g aꞌal nam pi d wabsh wechij id eda t‑wohochudadag.  
1CO03:2	I gave you milk—I couldn't give you solid food to eat, because you weren't ready for it.  	Heg o wa wepo mani g wihbi em‑iꞌichud ch pi g haꞌichu hugi em‑gegosid ab wabsh s‑bahbagi haꞌichu em‑ahgidch. Chum wa iaꞌi idani amt koi geꞌegeꞌehogat  
1CO03:3	Even now you're not ready for it, because you're still worldly. Since you're still jealous and argumentative, doesn't that show you're worldly, behaving just like ordinary people do?  	k hab wabsh kia chuꞌig mo hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh. Neh, am am aꞌai s‑e hehgamk ch aꞌai e kawani. K id hekaj am tasho mam ha oidch hab e wua hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh.  
1CO03:4	When one of you says, “I follow Paul,” while another says, “I follow Apollos,” doesn't that show you're being so very human? 	Haꞌijj amsh hab chechꞌe mam ahni Paul am ni‑oid ch haꞌijj hab chechꞌe mam g Apollos am oid. K id am wohokamchud mam ha wepo haꞌichu chegito hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh. 
1CO03:5	Who is Apollos, anyway? And who is Paul? We're just servants through whom you believed. Each of us does the work God gave us to do.  	Pi ach d si haꞌichu ch d wabsh piongaj g Jiosh mamt ab t‑ab bei g wohokam ab amjed g Christ. Do Jiosh mo ab t‑mahkch g t‑chikpan. Kuch am hab wabsh junihim mo haschu ab t‑mahkch hab masma mo g oidag ch ed chikpandam.  
1CO03:6	I did the planting, Apollos did the watering—but it was God who made you grow! 	Heg o wa wepo mani ahni am esh g haꞌichu kai am wehpeg ahgch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. K g Apollos am wapga g esha am baꞌich i ahgch. K wabshaba d Jiosh ch am i wuhshad g t‑esha mamt ab s‑wohochud k am heꞌes i oi g haꞌichu ahgaj mach am ahgachug.  
1CO03:7	So the one who does the planting doesn't count for anything, any more than the one who does the watering. The only one who matters is God who is growing you!  	Kuch heg hekaj pi d si haꞌichu ahchim mach am eshad ch wapga am ahgch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. Jiosh o d si haꞌichu no pi heg am i wuhshad g t‑esha mam ab s‑wohochud ahpim mam kah g haꞌichu ahgaj.  
1CO03:8	The one planting and the one watering have the same goal, and both will be rewarded according to what they've done. 	Wehs ach t‑wepo masma ahchim mach ahgachug g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga, chum achs hema wehpeg am wo ah, tt hema am baꞌich wo i ahgahi. T g Jiosh ab wo t‑mah g t‑namkidadag matt heꞌes hab i juh g chikpan.  
1CO03:9	We are workers together with God—and you are God's field, his building.  	Pegih, dach piongaj g Jiosh g Apollos wehm. Kum ahpim d Jiosh eniga mach am em‑chikpan wehhejed g Jiosh. 
1CO03:10	Through the grace of God that he gave to me, I laid down the foundation like a skilled building supervisor. Now someone else is building on it. Whoever does the building needs to watch what they're doing.  	T heg ab i ni‑gawulkai mant em‑chikp hab masma mani d s‑ni‑mahchim kihtdam ch am shondad g kih am ahgachugk g Jesus Christ. Kum ahpim epai himchud g kihta ahgachugch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. K ab em‑ab mamt si s‑nenꞌoid k am hab wo junihid.  
1CO03:11	For no one can lay any other foundation than what's already laid—that is Jesus Christ.  	Shondaj o heki hu nahtois ch d Jesus Christ. Kumt pi haschukaj ab ep wo shondad.  
1CO03:12	Those who build on that foundation may use gold, silver, precious stone, wood, hay, or straw—  	Neh, tp hems wo e mehi matp haschu kih wabsh g shaꞌikaj hab wo e juh.  
1CO03:13	but whatever is used to build with will be exposed. For on the Day of Judgment fire will reveal it and test it. Everyone's work will be shown for what it is.  	Pegih, t hab wa masma wo i e aꞌappe g em‑chikpan. Mt heg hekaj si s‑ap hab wo juh  
1CO03:14	Those whose building survives will be rewarded.  	k hab wo bei g e‑namkidadag mat hekid wo e mamche.  
1CO03:15	Those whose building is burned up will lose out. They will still be saved, but it will be like passing through fire!  	T hi wo wa e doꞌibia matp hedai pi kehg hab juh g e‑chikpan. T wabshaba g chikpanaj wo huhug hab masma mat g shaꞌi wo meitto am mei ch ed. 
1CO03:16	Don't you know you are God's temple and that God's Spirit lives in you?  	Heg o wa wepo mach d Jiosh cheopiga no pi am t‑eda kih g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. Id amt wo chum s‑mahchk.  
1CO03:17	Anyone who destroys God's temple will be destroyed by God, for God's temple is holy, and you are the temple. 	Jiosh at wo padch matp hedai wo i em‑padch nam pi d enigaj ch d hekia s‑apꞌekam. 
1CO03:18	Don't deceive yourselves. If there's anyone of you who thinks they're worldly wise, they should become fools so they can become truly wise!  	Haꞌi amtp hab i e ahg mam s‑chu aꞌamichud am ha nena ed g hemajkam. Pi g am wo hejel e iattogid.

Am g wo i e nakog mamt an wo uꞌukchid, chum as hab wo em‑elidad mam pi haꞌichu aꞌamichud.  
1CO03:19	This world's wisdom is plain foolishness to God. As Scripture says, “He uses the cleverness of the wise to catch them out,”  	Do wabsh pi haꞌichu an Jiosh tahgio mo haschu idam hab elid mo d haꞌichu amichudadag. T g Jiosh an wo ha wulsh heg hekaj haꞌichu ha‑amichudadag mo hab masma an oꞌohanas wehhejed.

1CO03:21-22	So don't boast about people. For you have everything,  whether it's Paul or Apollos or Peter—or the world, or life, or death, or the present, or the future. You have everything—  	Kumt hekaj pi hedai wo chum ge t‑haꞌichuchudad. Dach wabsh em‑pionag g Apollos ch Peter ha wehm. Wehs ihda jewed o d em‑eniga. Hegai mo hemu in haꞌichug ch hegai mo ab hahawa him o d em‑eniga. Doakag ch muhkig d em‑apꞌedag.  
1CO03:23	and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's. 	Kum d Christ hemajkamga. K heg d alidaj g Jiosh. 
1CO04:1	So think of us as Christ's servants given the responsibility for “the mysteries of God.” 	Dach wabsh piongaj g Christ. K heg t‑nuhkudachud matt am wo i tashogi g s‑aꞌagi haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh. Kumt hab masma wo s‑t‑mahchk.

1CO04:3	Personally it hardly matters to me if you or anyone else judges me—in fact I don't even judge myself.  	Pegih, ni heg am waꞌi chikpanid Jiosh. K pi shaꞌi ni‑kudut mamtp has i masma hab wo elidad g ni‑chikpan ahpim o hedai i hemajkam. Niꞌinis hejel wo ah manis has masma hab wua.  
1CO04:4	I don't know of anything I've done wrong, but that doesn't make me right. It's the Lord who judges me.  	Pi o haꞌichu shaꞌi ni‑kudut am ni‑chegitoi ed manis pi ap am hab junihim g chikpan am Jiosh wehhejed. K wabshaba pi id hekaj e wohokamchud manis am wabsh i si s‑ap am hab junihim. Heg o waꞌi Jiosh s‑mahch machs hedai s‑ap am hab junihim g t‑chikpan.  
1CO04:5	So don't judge anything before the right time—when the Lord comes. He will bring to light all the darkest secrets that are hidden, and he will reveal people's motives. God will give everyone whatever praise they deserve. 	Mt heg hekaj pi ab hu wabsh si s‑hohtam hema haꞌichu wo abch mat koi wo e ai g tash.

1CO04:6	Now, brothers and sisters, I have applied this to Apollos and myself as an example for you. That way you will learn not to go beyond what has been written, and not in arrogance prefer one over the other.  	Neh, id ani am em‑ahgid, ni‑wepnag, ab t‑amjed ahni ch Apollos mant am wo i em‑tashogi mamt pi am hu dahm wo i chesh hegai mo haschu an oꞌohanas Jiosh oꞌohana ed.

1CO04:8	You think you have all you need. You think you're so wealthy. You think you're kings already, and don't need us.  I wish you were really ruling as kings, so we could rule with you!  	Bamsh e elid mam heki hu wehs haꞌichu edgid ch heki hu d s‑kakais ch d ge kokownal. Kuch eda ahchim Jesus Christ chuhchai pi d s‑kakais ch pi d kokownal. Mamt huꞌi woho d wo kokownalk.

1CO04:9	The way I see it, God has put us apostles on display as the last in the line, condemned to die. We have been made a public show before the entire universe, to angels and to human beings.

1CO05:9-10	In my previous letter I wrote that you should not associate with immoral people.

1CO05:11	What I meant when I wrote was that you shouldn't associate with anyone who is called a Christian who is immoral or greedy or worships idols; or who is abusive or a drunkard or who cheats others. Don't even share a meal with anyone like that!  	Hegam ani wa hab ha ahg mo hab e ahg mo d t‑wehm wohochuddam ch eda am hab junihim g pi apꞌekam.

1CO05:12-13	It's not my place to judge those outside the church. But shouldn't you judge those who are inside the church?  God judges those that are outside the church. “Expel the wicked from among you.” 	Pi o ab hu t‑ab machs wo mamche g ha‑chuꞌijig hegam mo pi d t‑wehm wohochuddam. Jiosh at hab wo ha juh.

1CO06:5	I'm trying to shame you by saying this. What? You can't find one wise person among you who can settle a dispute that you have?  	Dat wo s‑ta edam haꞌichuk mamt aꞌai wo e lodaitad. Ab amsh si has ha elid g s‑chu aꞌamichuddam ch amtp eda pi hema cheh am e shahgid mas am wo i em‑apꞌech.  
1CO06:6	Instead one believer takes another believer to court, and places the issue before unbelievers!  	K amsh aꞌai e lodait am wabsh ha nena ed hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh. 
1CO06:7	The very fact you have lawsuits against each other already is a complete disaster. Wouldn't it be better to accept the injustice? Why not let yourselves be defrauded?

1CO06:9	Don't you know those who are unjust will not inherit the kingdom of God? Don't be fooled! People who are immoral, worship idols, commit adultery, sexual perverts, homosexuals,  	Mt wo chum s‑mahchk mat g pi ap hemajkam pi am hu wo i wahp Jiosh kownaltalig ed.

People say,  	Kumsh hahawa haꞌi hab chechꞌe mo wehs haꞌichu hiwgidas matp haschu wehhejed pi an hu haꞌichug g chehanig. Nt wabshaba am wo em‑ahgi mo pi wehs haꞌichu s‑kehgaj am t‑wehhejed. Pi att wo chum hiwigi mat haschu gan hu wabsh wo i si t‑ui.  
1CO06:13	“Food for the stomach, and the stomach for food”—but God will destroy both of them. Also, the body is not meant to be used for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.  	Haꞌi amsh hab chechꞌe, “Haꞌichu hugi o ab d wuikamaj g t‑wohk ch g wohk g haꞌichu hugi ab d wuikam,” ch hab chum ahg mo wehs s‑apꞌe mach haschu i tatchua am wehhejed g t‑honshpadag.

1CO06:15	Don't you know your bodies are parts of Christ's body? Should I take the parts of Christ's body and join them to a prostitute? Absolutely not!  	Mt wo chum s‑mahchk mo g em‑honshpadag ab giꞌi ab g Christ ch d enigaj. Pegih, mt pi woho hab wo juh g e‑honshpadag mat ab wo i e wehnad g chehpaꞌawi.  
1CO06:16	Don't you realize that anyone who has sex with a prostitute becomes “one body” with her? Remember that Scripture says, “The two will become one body.” 	Aha nam pi mahch mamtp hema i wo wehmaj woꞌiwua g chehpaꞌawi k d haha wo hemakok heg wehm. Si o shel am ahg ihda g Jiosh oꞌohana ch hab chuꞌig mo d hemako am Jiosh tahgio hegam mat wo e wehm wohpiwua.

1CO06:18	Stay away from sexual immorality! All other sins that people commit are outside of the body, but sexual immorality is a sin against your own body.  	Ni heg hekaj hab kaij mamt wo si e nuhkud id amjed mamt pi wabsh chum hedai wehm wo woꞌiwupad namt pi heg hekaj wo e hemakoj ha wehm k wo uamhu g e‑honshpadag k hab masma wo i e mehkod ab amjed g Christ.  
1CO06:19	Don't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit that is within you, that you received from God?  	Mt wo chum s‑mahchk mo g Jiosh ab em‑mahkch g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. K heg am em‑eda kih. Pegih, k d cheopigaj g em‑honshpadag ch pi d wabsh hejel em‑eniga.  
1CO06:20	You don't belong to yourself—a price was paid for you! So glorify God in your body! 	Jiosh at am i dagito g e‑alidag kots wui mat wo t‑doꞌibia. Kutt d haha wo hemajkamgajk ch heg hekaj ab wo si has i elid k wehhejed wo hekaj g t‑honshpadag. 
1CO07:1	Now about what you wrote to me: “It's good not to marry.” 	Ia ant haha wo em‑ahgi hegai mam wa ni‑kakke ia ni‑oꞌohanidk. 
1CO07:2	However, because of the temptation to sexual immorality, it is better that each man have his own wife, and each woman her own husband.  	K wabshaba haꞌi g ha‑tatchuidag si s‑gewkdag. K idam ha wehhejed baꞌich i s‑apꞌe mat wo e hohnt mat heg hekaj pi am hu wo i shul pi apꞌekam ch ed. 
1CO07:3-4	The husband should meet his wife's sexual needs, and the wife her husband's.  The wife's body doesn't just belong to her, but her husband; and similarly the husband's body doesn't just belong to him but his wife.  	Kumt ab aꞌai e wui wo e dagito ahpim mam d e hohonikam no pi g em‑honshpadag d aꞌai em‑eniga ch pi d wabsh heheꞌejel em‑eniga. Mt hab s‑ap e tahtk ch wo e wehm kihk.  
1CO07:5	So don't deprive each other, except by mutual consent for a while— for example because you want to spend time in prayer. Afterwards be together again so that Satan won't tempt you to sin because of your lack of self-control.  	Pi g aꞌai wo e daꞌad, heg hi wa mamtp am aꞌai wo e apꞌech mamt heꞌes i tash pi ab hu wo i e miabi mamt heg hab wo waꞌi juh hoꞌigeꞌidahuna k am hab hahawa ep wo masmak mam heki hu mat pi wo em‑gehg g ge Jiawul heg hekaj em‑tatchui. 
1CO07:6	I'm telling you this not as a command, but as a concession.  	Pi ani ab hu em‑chehani mams wo ge hohont, heg hi wa mamtp wo tatchuad ch wo e hohont.  
1CO07:7	However I wish that everyone was like me, but each person has their own gift from God—one has this gift, one has another.  	Mamt huꞌi pi wo ha wehm kihkamk hab masma mani ahni. K wabshaba g Jiosh pi wehs hab masma em‑apꞌechudch ch haꞌi em‑apꞌechudch mamt wo e hohont. 
1CO07:8	To those who are not yet married, or who are widowed, I would say it is better if they remain like me.  	Nt wo haꞌichu em‑ahgi ahpim mam pi ha wehm kihkam ch ahpim mat koi g em‑wehm kihkam. Baꞌich o i s‑apꞌe mamt wo heheꞌejelk mani hab masma.  
1CO07:9	But if they lack self-control, then they should get married—for it is better to marry than burn with desire. 	Mt wabshaba wo e hohont mamtp pi wo e nako mamt wo shohbi g e‑tatchui. Baꞌich o i s‑apꞌe mamt wo e hohont mamt pi wo e kudutad g e‑tatchuikaj. 
1CO07:10	These are my instructions to those who are married—in fact not from me but the Lord: The wife should not leave her husband  	Do chehanigaj g t‑kownalig Jesus mamt pi wo ohhod g e‑wehm kihkam  
1CO07:11	(or if she does, she should not re-marry, or she should return to her husband); and the husband should not leave his wife. 	k amtp wabshaba hab wo sha e juh k hemho wa pi hema ep wo hohnt o wo kunt k wabsh wo hejelk o an uhpam ep wo i e nodagi e‑wehm kihkam wui. 
1CO07:12-14	Now, to the rest of you, (and this is me speaking, not the Lord), I would say, “If a Christian man has a non-Christian wife and she is willing to stay with him, he should not leave her.  And if a Christian woman has a non-Christian husband, and he is willing to stay with her, she should not leave her husband.” For a husband who is not a Christian, the marriage relationship is made holy by the Christian wife, and for a wife who is not a Christian, the marriage relationship is made holy by the Christian husband. Otherwise it would mean your children were impure, but now they are holy.  	Chum as pi d wo em‑wehm wohochuddamk g em‑wehm kihkam, mt pi am hu wo ha ohhod matp wo tatchuad mat an wo em‑wehmajk. Jiosh at am i apꞌech em‑wehhejed mat pi wo padch g em‑kihdag. T g Jiosh ab wo ha ui g em‑aꞌaliga mat d wo aꞌaligajk. T g em‑wehm kihkam pi wo ha padch. 
1CO07:15	However if the non-Christian spouse leaves, let them leave. In such cases the Christian man or woman is not slavishly bound, for God has called us to live in peace.  	Mt wabshaba wo ha hiwigi mat wo s‑em‑ohhod matp wo tatchuad nam pi pi heg hekaj e wupulshch matp wo s‑em‑ohhod. Do tatchuij g Jiosh mamt wo s‑ap e tahtkkad id dahm jewed.  
1CO07:16	Wives, who knows? You may save your husband! Husbands, who knows? You may save your wife! 	Kum pi mahch mas em‑hekaj ab wo s‑wohoch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga k wo e doꞌibia. 
1CO07:17	Apart from such cases, each of you should remain in the situation that the Lord has placed you, and continue to live the life to which God has called you. That's my instruction to all the churches.  	Pegih, tt am wabsh wo kia oidad mattp haschu d i wehhejedkam mat hekid ab i t‑gawulkai g Christ. Id ani wehsko ha mashcham g wohochuddam.  
1CO07:18-19	Were you circumcised when you were converted? Don't become uncircumcised. Were you uncircumcised when you were converted? Don't become circumcised.  Circumcision doesn't mean anything, and uncircumcision doesn't mean anything. Keeping the commandments of God is what really matters.  	Pi o has d ahga mamtp wo pahl hikuchkask o pi wo pahl hikuchkask. Kumt pi wo chum ge gawul e juh id hekaj. Heg o d waꞌi si haꞌichu matt ab wo s‑wohog elidad g Jiosh.

1CO07:22	If you were a slave when the Lord called you, you are now free, working for the Lord. In the same way if you were called when you were free, you are now Christ's slave!  	Am g wo s‑chegitok mat em‑wulꞌo g Christ ab amjed g pi apꞌekam, chum ams d nehol. Wehsijj ach d hahawa neneholigaj g Christ, chum hems ahchim mach pi d ha‑neneholiga id dahm jewed.

1CO07:25	Now about “people who are not married,”  I don't have a specific instruction from the Lord, so let me give you my opinion as someone who by the Lord's mercy is considered trustworthy.  	Neh, nt am haha wo em‑ahgi mam haschu ab ni‑kakke ab ha amjed hegam mo pi ha wehm kihkam. Pi o d chehanig ihda mant wo em‑ahgi.

1CO07:28	If you do get married, you haven't sinned. If an unmarried woman gets married, she hasn't sinned. But you will have many troubles in this current world and I would want to spare you these.

1CO07:31	and those who are engaged with the world as if it is not fulfilling—for the present world order is passing away. 	Tt wo hekaj g jewed dahm haꞌichu k wabshaba pi ab hu wabsh wo si pihk t‑elidad nat pi wehs wabsh wo huhug. 
1CO07:32	I would prefer you to be free from such worries. A man who is not married pays attention to what is important to the Lord, and how he can please the Lord.  	Chum ani em‑tatchuichud mamt pi haꞌichukaj wo e kudutad. Gohkpa o kahch g t‑chegitoi matt wo ge hohnigk. Kutt wabshaba wo t‑nako matt heg am hab wo waꞌi junihid chikpan am wehhejed g t‑kownalig Jesus mattp pi wo ha hohnigk.  
1CO07:33	But a man who is married pays attention to what is important in this world, and how he can please his wife.  	Mattp hedai wo ha hohnt k hemho wa haꞌichu am hab waꞌap wo junihid wehhejed mat wo s‑hohhoꞌidad. 
1CO07:34	As a result his loyalties are divided. Similarly an unmarried woman or girl pays attention to what is important to the Lord, so she may live a life dedicated both in body and spirit. But a married woman pays attention to what is important in this world, and how she can please her husband.  	Kumt ahpim uꞌuwi hab waꞌap wo e nako mamt ab wo gawulkdask ch heg am hab wo waꞌi junihid chikpan am wehhejed g t‑kownalig Jesus mamtp hedai pi wo ha kunk o koi wo ha kunt. Mtp wabshaba hedai wo ge kunk ch haꞌichu am hab ep wo junihid ha wehhejed mat wo s‑hohhoꞌidad. 
1CO07:35	I'm telling you this for your benefit. I'm not trying to put a noose around your neck, but to show you the right thing to do so you can serve the Lord without being distracted. 	Id ani hab kaij nani pi tatchua mant am wo i em‑wehmt ch pi heg hekaj manis am haꞌichukaj em‑shoshobid. Tatchua ani mamt am hab wo junihid mo haschu d s‑apꞌekam ch pi wo hiwigi mas am haꞌichu wo em‑shohbi mamt am wehs wo i e dagito t‑kownalig Jesus wui. 
1CO07:36	But if a man thinks he's behaving improperly with the woman he's engaged to, and if he thinks he will give in to his strong sexual desire, and if he thinks he ought to get married, he is not sinning by getting married.  	Mt wabshaba wo ha hiwigi g uꞌuwi e‑aꞌaliga mat wo ha kunt mamtp hab wo elidad mo d si tatchui nat pi s‑ap geꞌegeꞌehogat. Am o wa s‑apꞌe mat am hab wo e juh.  
1CO07:37	But if a man stays true to his principles, and there is no obligation to marry, and has the power to keep his feelings under control and stay engaged to her, he does well not to marry.  	K wabshaba am wa s‑apꞌe mamt wo ha nuhkudad mamtp hab wo elidad mo s‑apꞌe no pi pi d tatchui.  
1CO07:38	So the man who marries the woman he's engaged to does well, while the one who does not get married does better. 	Pegih, am o wa s‑apꞌe mamt wo ha hiwigi ch hi wa baꞌich i s‑apꞌe mat pi wo ha kunt. 
1CO07:39	A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies,  she is free to marry whoever she wants in the Lord. 	Matp hedai wo e hohont k d wo e‑wehm kihkamk am hugkam mat hekid hema wo i muh. K am hahawa s‑apꞌe mat ep wo bei g wehm kihkam, heg hi wa mat g e‑wehm wohochuddam an wo bei.  
1CO07:40	But in my opinion she would be happier if she didn't re-marry—and I think I too have the Spirit of God when I say this. 	Mt wabshaba baꞌich wo i s‑apꞌe tahtkkad mamt pi ep wo bei g wehm kihkam. Neh, id o am ni‑tashogid g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. 
1CO08:1	Now about “food sacrificed to idols.” So “we all have knowledge” about this subject. Knowledge makes us proud, but love strengthens us.  	Am ant haha wo em‑ahgi hegai mam ab ni‑kakke ab amjed hegai haꞌichu hugi mo g hemajkam an toꞌaw am chum iagchulidch g e‑jijoshga. 
1CO08:2	If anyone thinks they know anything, they don't know as they really should know!  	Pi amki koi haꞌichu s‑mahch mamtp hab e elid mam s‑e‑mahch.  
1CO08:3	But whoever loves God is known by God… 	Jiosh o s‑t‑mahch ahchim mattp ab si tatchua. 
1CO08:4	So regarding eating food sacrificed to idols: we know that there are no such things as idols in the world, and that there is only one real God.  	Pegih, k pi d haꞌichu g ha‑jijoshga am t‑wehhejed nach pi s‑mahch mo g Jiosh d hemako.  
1CO08:5	Even though there are some things called “gods,” whether in heaven or on earth—in fact there are many “gods” and “lords.”  	K eda muꞌi an haꞌichug g gewpkdag an dahm kahchim ch ed ch an jewed dahm mo hab e aꞌaga jijosh ch kokownal.  
1CO08:6	But for us there is only one God, the Father, from whom everything was made, and he is the goal of our existence; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom everything was made, and he is the means of our existence. 	Ch ahchim hi s‑mahch mo d hemako g Jiosh t‑ohg. K wehs haꞌichu d amjedkamaj. Kuch heg wehhejed in d dodakam. K g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ d hemako ch wehs haꞌichu nahto. K heg gahi wuhshanim g Jiosh ab t‑mahkch g wechij doakag. 
1CO08:7	But not everyone has this “knowledge.”  Some who up to now have been so used to idols as a reality that when they eat food sacrificed to an idol, their conscience (which is weak) tells them they have defiled themselves.  	Pegih, msh haꞌi hi wa s‑mahch mo g ha‑jijoshga pi d haꞌichu am t‑wehhejed ch hekaj pi has e elid ch wabsh koꞌa hegai mo an e toꞌaw ha wehhejed. Sh haꞌi g em‑wehm wohochuddam pi am hu s‑ap s‑mahch mo pi d haꞌichu g ha‑jijoshga no pi heki hu waꞌi amjed ab has ha elid. Kumsh koꞌa hegai mo am e toꞌaw. Sh idam am em‑neid ch am em‑oidch hab e junihim ch eda hekaj e kudut no pi hab elid mo pi apꞌe.  
1CO08:8	But food doesn't gain us God's approval! If we don't eat this food, we're not bad, and if we do eat this food, we're not good.  	Kumsh ahpim hab kaij mo pi has d ahga am Jiosh nena ed mamt wo huh ihda. Pegih, matp pi has d ahga k ch pi haꞌichu wo heki em‑wua mamt wabsh wo dagito. 
1CO08:9	Just take care not to use this freedom you have to eat food sacrificed to idols to become offensive to those with a weaker attitude.  	Chum as hi wa s‑apꞌe hejel em‑wehhejed mamt wo huh ch wabshaba pi apꞌe mamt wo huh matp heg hekaj wo e kudut k wo i shul hegam mo pi hab masma s‑mahch ihda.  
1CO08:10	If another believer sees you who have such “better knowledge”  eating food in an idol temple, won't his weak conscience be convinced to eat food sacrificed to idols? 	Idam atp hems am t‑oidk hab wo e juh ahchim mach haꞌichu s‑mahch k am hab wo juh mo haschu hab elid mo pi apꞌe. Pi att am hu wo i wahp k wo t‑gegos mo hebai i e koꞌa hegai mo an e toꞌaw ha wehhejed g ha‑jijoshga  
1CO08:11	By your “better knowledge” the weaker believer is destroyed, a believer for whom Christ died.  	natt pi heg hekaj wo heki ha himch hegam mo pi gewpkdag e‑wohochudadag ed. Tsh eda g Christ ha wehhejed muh no pi s‑ha doꞌibiamk.  
1CO08:12	In this way you sin against other believers, wounding their weaker consciences, and you sin against Christ.  	Kutt wo padch mo haschu hab chum s‑junimk am ha wehhejed mattp wo heki ha himch.  
1CO08:13	So if eating food sacrificed to idols would cause my fellow believer to stumble, I will never eat such meat ever again, so that I don't offend any believer. 	Pi att hekid wo huh matp haschukaj wo heb hu hihi g t‑wepnag mat am t‑oidch hab wo e junihid. 
1CO09:1	Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Haven't I seen Jesus our Lord? Aren't you the results of my work in the Lord?  	Pi ani em‑ahgid mams am hab wo junihid hegai mani ahni haschu pi am hu hab wua. Ahni ani hab waꞌap pi hekaj g haꞌichu ni‑apꞌedag, chum anis d uhgchu ch geꞌe apꞌedag nat pi am i ni‑kei g Jiosh mant wo ahgachugad g Christ. Ni heg am neid am i dahm mat e chegito k i wuhsh. Kum ahpim d e doꞌibiakam heg hekaj haꞌichu ni‑ahga mani am ahgachug wehhejed g Jesus Christ.  
1CO09:2	Even if I'm not an apostle to others, at least I am one to you. The proof of my being an apostle of the Lord is you! 	Chum as haꞌi pi wohochud mani d Jesus Christ kehsha, m wabshaba ahpim s‑wohochud nat pi em‑doꞌibia k hekaj am wohokamch mani d kehshaj.  
1CO09:3	Here is my reply to those who question me about this:  	Id ani am ha ahgid hegam mo pi wohochud mani d Christ kehsha. 
1CO09:4	Don't we have the right to be provided with food and drink?  	Ahchim mach d Christ chuhchai ach edgid g apꞌedag matt ab wo bei g t‑gegosig heg hekaj t‑chikpan.  
1CO09:5	Don't we have a right to be accompanied by a Christian wife, like the rest of the apostles, the Lord's brothers, and Peter?  	Christ wepnag ch Peter ch haꞌi ehp g Christ chuhchai ash an uhꞌudch g e‑wehm kihkam mo eda hasko hihhim ch am ahgachug g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. Kumsh am ha dagioꞌid.

1CO09:7	Which soldier ever had to pay his own salary? Who plants a vineyard and doesn't get to eat its fruits? Who feeds a flock and doesn't consume its milk? 	K eda wehs nahnko mahs chikpandam ab uꞌu g e‑gehgewi ab e‑chikpan amjed. Shondal am ha dagioꞌid ch g oidag chikpandam ab ha namkid heg hekaj mo haschu i bahijid ch g haꞌichu doakam ha nuhkuddam ha gegosid heg hekaj mo haschu ab i wuhshani. 
1CO09:8	Am I just speaking from a human point of view? Doesn't the law say the same thing?  	Pi o d wabsh hemajkam hab ha‑elida ihda. An o hab chuꞌig heg eda Jiosh chehanig  
1CO09:9	In the law of Moses it's written, “Don't muzzle the ox when it's threshing out the grain.” Was God just thinking about oxen?  	mat g Mosesbad an oꞌoha: 
1CO09:13	Don't you know that those who work in temples receive their meals from temple offerings, and those that serve at the altar receive their portion of the sacrifice on the altar?  	Mt wo chum s‑mahchk mo hegam mo am chikpan geꞌe cheopi ch ed ab i neid g e‑gegosig heg amjed mo g hemajkam ab mahkch g Jiosh.  
1CO09:14	In just the same way the Lord ordered that those who announce the good news should live from supporters of the good news.  	Pegih, k hab waꞌap masma am t‑chehani g t‑kownalig Jesus hemu. Ahchim mach am ahgachug g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh attsh ab amjed wo i nei g t‑dagioꞌidadag. 
1CO09:15	But I have not made use of any of these provisions, and I'm not writing about this to suggest it should be done in my case. I'd rather die than to have anyone take away my pride in not having received any benefit. 	Ni eda pi hekid shaꞌi hekaj ihda ni‑apꞌedag ch pi heg hekaj em‑ahgid ihda manis em‑chehani mamt wo i ni‑dagioꞌi hemu. Baꞌich i mant wo bihugim k wo muh kih hegai manis wo em‑kowlant id hekaj s‑kehg haꞌichu ahga.  
1CO09:16	I have nothing to boast about in sharing the good news because it's something I feel compelled to do. In fact it's dreadful for me if I don't share the good news!  	Ab o ni‑chehani g Jiosh mant wo ahgachugad g haꞌichu ahgaj. Kunt wo si pi ap ni‑tahtkk mantp pi am hu hab wo junihid.

1CO09:17	If I'm doing this work because of my own choice, then I have a reward. But if it wasn't my choice, and an obligation was placed on me,  	Mantp ahni hab i n‑ah mant am hab wo junihid ihda chikpan ch hekaj ab wo bei g ni‑gehgewi. K wabshaba g Jiosh ab ni‑chehani ch ab ni‑hiwig.  
1CO09:18	then what reward do I have? It's the opportunity to share the good news without charging for it, not demanding my rights as a worker for the good news. 	Pegih, k id d ni‑gehgewi mani si s‑ap ni‑tahtk heg hekaj mani ab wabsh em‑mahkch g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh. Heg ani hekaj pi hekaj g ni‑apꞌedag manis wo em‑kowlant.

1CO09:20	To the Jews I behave like a Jew so that I might win Jews. To those who are under the law I behave as someone under the law (even though I am not obligated under the law), so that I might win those under the law.  	Ni am ha oidch hab ni‑junihim hegam mo am oid g heki hu t‑himdag ahchim Tutuligo mani hekid i ha wehmaj  
1CO09:21	To those who don't operate according to the law, I behave like them, (though not disregarding God's law, but operating under the law of Christ), so that I might gain those who don't observe the law. 	ch am ha oidch hab ni‑junihim hegam mo pi am hu oid mani hekid i ha wehmaj mant hekaj ab wo i ha nohnogi Christ wui. K eda pi hab mahs manis pi ab hu wecho g Jiosh chehanig nani pi am hab junihim mo haschu ab i ni‑chehani g Christ.  
1CO09:22	To those who are weak, I share in their weakness so that I may win the weak. I have ended up being “everyman” to everyone so that by using every possible means I might win some!  	Pi ant am hab wo junihid mat haschu wo ha kudutad, chum anis s‑mahch mo s‑apꞌe am ni‑wehhejed. Tp hems heg hekaj wo ni‑hiwigi mant am wo i ha wehmt.

1CO10:3	They all ate the same spiritual food  	Wehsijj ash am koꞌa hegai haꞌichu hugi mash g Jiosh ab ha mahk

1CO10:13	You won't experience any greater temptation than anyone else, and God is trustworthy. He won't allow you to be tempted more than you can bear, and when you are tempted, he will provide for you a way out so you can stay strong.  	Wehs hegai aꞌappema mo ab t‑aihim o chum hedai ab aꞌahe.

1CO10:16	When we give thanks for the cup we use in the Lord's Supper, don't we share in the blood of Christ? When we break the communion bread, don't we share in the body of Christ?

1CO10:28-29	But if someone tells you, “This food has been sacrificed to idols,” don't eat it for the sake of the one who mentioned it and for conscience' sake.  His conscience I mean, not yours. For why should my freedom be determined by someone else's conscience? 	T wabshaba hema ab wo sha si em‑ahgi mat ab e toꞌi g ha‑jijoshga, mt pi wo huh mat heg hekaj pi wo e kudu hegai mo em‑ahgid.

1CO11:3	I do want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man, the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ.  	Mt wabshaba wo chum s‑mahchk mo g cheoj am dahm g uwi. K g Christ am dahm g cheoj. K g Jiosh am wehs haꞌichu dahm.  
1CO11:4	A man's head is dishonored if he prays or prophesies with his head covered.  	Id amt wo chehgidch mam eda e mihshmad.

1CO11:5	A woman's head is dishonored if she prays or prophesies with her head uncovered—it's just as if she had her hair shaved off.  	Kumt ahpim uꞌuwi hi ab wo ha maꞌishchid g e‑mohmi mam hekid i ha kaichudch e hoꞌigeꞌidahun ch am ep ahg g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.

1CO11:6	If a woman's head is not covered, then she should have her head shaved. If it's scandalous for a woman to be shorn or shaven, then she should have her head covered.  	Pegih, mt ab wo e maꞌishchid ch wo e mihshmad k heg hekaj pi wo si e el. 
1CO11:7	A man shouldn't cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God, while the woman is the glory of the man.  	Kumt ahpim chechoj pi ab hu wo ha maꞌishchid g e‑mohmi e mihshmadch no pi g Jiosh am t‑eda chehgidch g e‑gewkdag. Mt wabshaba ahpim uꞌuwi ab wo e maꞌishchid nam pi ab wecho g chechoj ch ab chehgidch g ha‑gewkdag.  
1CO11:8-9	Man didn't come from woman, but woman came from man;  and man was not created for the woman, but the woman was created for the man.  	Jiosh at wehpeg nahto g cheoj k heg amjed ab i wuhshad g uwi k nahto am wehhejed g cheoj.  
1CO11:10	That's why the woman should have this sign of authority on her head out of respect for the watching angels.  	Ab o em‑neid g anghil. Kumt ahpim uꞌuwi am wo ha chehgi ab ha maꞌishch g e‑mohmi mam ab ha wecho g chechoj. 
1CO11:11	Even so, from the Lord's perspective, the woman is as essential as the man, and the man as essential as the woman.  	K eda hab d elidaj g Jiosh mat g cheoj ch uwi ab aꞌai wo e hiwgad ch ab aꞌai wo i e wehmajk.  
1CO11:12	As the woman came from the man, so the man comes from the woman —but more importantly everything comes from God.  	Woho o wa mat g Jiosh ab i wuhshad g uwi ab amjed g cheoj. K wabshaba g chechoj ab hahawa uwi t amjed i wuwhag. K wehs haꞌichu ab d Jiosh amjedkam. 
1CO11:13	Judge for yourselves: is it appropriate for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered?  	Am g wo oidahid ihda mo pi hab chum chuꞌig mas g uwi ab wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahu Jiosh wui pi ab hu maꞌishch g e‑moꞌo.  
1CO11:14	Doesn't nature itself indicate that a man with long hair disgraces himself?  	S‑mahch ach mo g cheꞌechew moꞌo s‑ta edama am wehhejed g cheoj  
1CO11:15	However a woman with long hair brings herself glory, because her hair is given to her as a covering.  	ch wabshaba am wa s‑apꞌe g uwi wehhejed no pi ab mahkch g Jiosh mat hekaj ab wo e maꞌishchid g moꞌoj. 
1CO11:16	But if anyone wants to argue about this, we don't have any other custom than this, and neither do any other of God's churches. 	Pi ani ahpim waꞌi em‑mashcham ihda.

1CO11:17	Now in giving you the instructions that follow I can't commend you, because when you meet together you cause more harm than good!  	Msh am haꞌichu ep pi ap hab wua mam am e hehemapad.  
1CO11:18	First of all, I hear that when you have church meetings that you are split into different factions, and I believe there's some truth to this.  	Wehpeg ant id hab wo ah mani kah mamsh haꞌi ab e wui gegok am e nanmekch. Ni am wa heꞌes s‑wohochud ihda.  
1CO11:19	Of course such splits among you must happen so those who are genuine can prove themselves by their evidence!  	Hemho wa at am wo i wuhsh g hab mahs kudutadag em‑shahgid mat am wo i e tashogi mo hedai pi apꞌe. 
1CO11:20	When you meet together you're not really celebrating the Lord's Supper at all.  	Naꞌams hab elid mam s‑ap hab wua g chemait hugi hekid i e nanmekch ch amsh eda pi ap am hab junihim.  
1CO11:21	Some want to eat first before everyone else, leaving others hungry. Still others get drunk.  	Wehpeg amsh e wehm e gegosid ch eda pi aꞌai e hoꞌid ch haꞌi wabsh s‑kokwog ch haꞌi nawkoꞌo ch haꞌi bihugkoꞌo.  
1CO11:22	Don't you have your own houses to eat and drink in? Do you look down on God's church, and humiliate those who are poor? What should I tell you? That you're doing really well? I have nothing good to say about you for doing this! 	Bo wa masma tasho mam pi ab hu has ha elid g e‑wehm wohochuddam ch wabsh si ha edawua hegam mo am d wa shoꞌigkam. Mt hemho wa ab wo e chuꞌijigch id hekaj. Baꞌich o i s‑apꞌe mamt wo e gegos heheꞌejel e‑kihki am k am hab wo juh g chemait hugi mam am e nanmek. 
1CO11:23	For I received from the Lord what I passed on to you: the Lord Jesus on the night he was betrayed took some bread.  	Am ani wa em‑mashcham hegai mo wa g t‑kownalig Jesus am ni‑tashogid ab amjed ihda chemait hugi himdag. Am atsh i shonwua heg i hudunk ab mamtki wa wo gagda matki wo e muhkid. Hegam mash wa ab wui e dagitokch atsh am i e hemapai. Kutsh g Jesus am i bei g chemait  
1CO11:24	After giving thanks, he broke the bread into pieces and said, “This bread is my body, which is given for you. Remember me by doing this.”  	k am i hahai ab hoꞌigeꞌidk g Jiosh k hab kaij, “Do ni‑honshpadag ihda mamt am i em‑hahaini. Id ani hab ahgch hab kaij mant wo ni‑muhkid am em‑wehhejed. Ab g wo huhgi ihda hahainig k id chum hekid am hab wo junihid mamt hekaj wo s‑ni‑chegitok.” 
1CO11:25	In the same way he took the cup, after the meal, and said, “This cup is the new agreement sealed with my blood. Remember me when you drink it.  	Tsh wa woho hab e juh. Kutsh am hahawa bei g tahsa k hab kaij, “Do ni‑ehꞌed ihda nawait. Id ani hab ahgch hab kaij mat g ni‑ehꞌed wo e iawua. T g Jiosh heg hekaj am hab wo juh hegai mo wa hab kaij matsh hab wo em‑juni. Ab g wo ihꞌi ihda k id chum hekid am hab wo junihid mamt wo s‑ni‑chegitok.” Neh, bo kaij g t‑kownalig Jesus.  
1CO11:26	For every time you eat this bread and drink from this cup you announce the Lord's death, until he returns.” 	Kuch hekid am hab i wua ihda chemait hugi ch am tasho wohokamchud mat t‑wehhejed muh ch ab aihim mat ep wo jiwia. 
1CO11:27-28	So anyone who eats the bread or drinks from the Lord's cup in a dishonorable way will be guilty of doing wrong against the body and blood of the Lord.  Let each person examine themselves, and then let them eat the bread and drink from the cup.  	Pegih, tt am wo si hejel i t‑mamche machs wa woho ab haꞌichuchud g t‑kownalig Jesus k am hab haha wo juh g chemait hugi.

1CO11:29	Those who eat and drink bring judgment on themselves if they don't recognize their relationship with the body of the Lord.  	Tt am wo ai g s‑koꞌok t‑namkidadag mattp hab wo juh g chemait hugi pi amichudch mat am t‑wehhejed muh g t‑kownalig Jesus.  
1CO11:30	That's the reason why many of you are weak and sick, and some even have died.  	Heg am hekaj muꞌijj kokꞌo ch pi ab hu gewpk ch haꞌijj heki hu koi.  
1CO11:31-32	However, if we really examined ourselves, we would not be judged like this.  But when we are judged, we are being disciplined by the Lord so that we won't be condemned along with the world.  	Bat wa masma hab wo t‑juh g Jiosh hab ahgk matt wo dagito g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig k pi gam hu hab wo i t‑juh ab amjed g Jiosh hab masma mat hegam mat pi ab hu wui wo i e nohnogi.

1CO11:33	So my brothers and sisters, when you meet together to eat the Lord's Supper, wait for each other.  	Pegih, ni‑wepnag, am amt wo aꞌai e nenida k wehs e wehm hab wo juh g chemait hugi.  
1CO11:34	If anyone is hungry, then eat at home so that when you meet together you won't bring condemnation on yourselves. I'll give you more directions when I visit. 	Matp hema d wo bihugimkamk ch wo e gegos ab e‑kih ab mat koi wo e ai g em‑namki. Mt am hahawa pi heg hekaj ab hu wo e chuꞌijigch.

1CO12:1	Now about “spiritual gifts.”  My brothers and sisters, I want to explain this to you.  	Ab am wa ep ni‑kakke ab amjed hegai gewkdag mo g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ab t‑mahkch matt ab aꞌai wo i t‑wehmajk. Tatchua ani mamt wo s‑mahchk g wohokam ab amjed ihda.  
1CO12:2	You know that when you were pagans, you were deceived, being led astray by worshiping idols who couldn't even speak.  	Idani am hahawa s‑mahch mam wa haꞌichukaj am i e wanimed mam eda ab has ha elid mam haschu i chum jijoshchud.  
1CO12:3	Let me make it clear to you: no one who speaks in the Spirit of God says, “Curse Jesus!” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord!” except by the Holy Spirit.  	K wabshaba pi d Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ch am i em‑wanimed namt wa ge e nako mams wo wohokamch mo g Jesus d Jiosh. Hegam mo pi edgid g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag o hab elid mo g Jesus am gawulkdas ab Jiosh t amjed. Kuch wabshaba ahchim mach edgid s‑mahch mo g Jesus d Jiosh. 
1CO12:4	Now there are different kinds of spiritual gifts, but they come from the same Spirit.  	Ab o t‑mahkch g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag g gewkdag matt hab wo junihid g nahnko mahs haꞌichu am wehhejed g Jiosh.  
1CO12:5	There are different kinds of ministries, but they come from the same Lord.  	K g t‑kownalig Jesus am apꞌechudch matt has masma am hab wo junihid.  
1CO12:6	There are different ways of working, but they come from the same God, who is at work in all of them.  	K d nahnko mahs chikpan mach am hab junihim ch wabshaba wehs ab d amjedkamaj g Jiosh. 
1CO12:7	The Spirit is given to each of us and is revealed for the good of all.  	Heg o ab t‑mahkch g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. K id am t‑gewpkadch ch ab heheꞌejel t‑mahkch matt has wo t‑junihid ch am aꞌai wo i t‑wehmajk. Kuch s‑mahch mo am t‑eꞌeda g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag no pi ab t‑mahkch g gewkdag.  
1CO12:8	One person is given by the Spirit the ability to speak words of wisdom. Another is given a message of knowledge by the same Spirit.  	Ab o haꞌijj t‑mahkch matt wo s‑chu aꞌamichud k am wo tashogi g s‑hasig haꞌichu ch ab haꞌijj t‑mahkch matt wo si s‑mahchk ch ahgachugad g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.  
1CO12:9	Another receives the gift of strongly trusting in God by the same Spirit. Another receives gifts of healing from that one Spirit.  	Ab o haꞌijj t‑mahkch g geꞌe wohochudadag ch ab haꞌijj t‑mahkch matt wo ha doaj  
1CO12:10	Another is given the ability to perform miracles. Another receives the gift of prophecy. Another is given the gift of spiritual discernment. Another receives the ability to speak different languages while another is given the gift of interpreting languages.  	o g s‑hasig haꞌichu hab ep wo junihid. Ab o haꞌijj heheꞌejel t‑mahkch g haꞌichu e‑ahga matt wo ahgad ch ab haꞌijj t‑mahkch matt wo neneokad g pi t‑machiga neꞌokikaj ch ab haꞌijj t‑mahkch matt wabsh wo s‑amich hegam neꞌoki k am wo i tashogi k ch ab haꞌijj t‑mahkch matt wo s‑mahchk mo haschu ahga ab amjed g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ch haschu pi ab hu amjed.  
1CO12:11	But all of these gifts are the work of the one and the same Spirit, sharing with each person as he alone chooses. 	Neh, wehs ihda o ab d amjedkamaj g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. K heg ab heheꞌejel t‑mahkch mo has i mahs chikpan am hab s‑junimk ab gai t‑wuhshanim. 
1CO12:12	Just like the human body is one unit but has many parts—all the parts of the body even though there are many of them, make up one body—so is Christ.  	S‑mahch ach mo g t‑honshpadag muꞌi nahnko chuhchuꞌidag ch wabshaba d waꞌi hemako. Kuch hab wa masma wehsijj d hemako ahchim matt ab i t‑wehnad g Christ.  
1CO12:13	For it was through one Spirit that we were all baptized into one body. It doesn't matter whether we are Jews or Greeks, slave or free—we all were given the one Spirit to drink.  	Muꞌijj am hi wa pi d Tutuligo. Tt wabshaba pi wo t‑nako machs hab wo chei mam pi d t‑wehm wohochuddam. Haꞌijj am hi wa d nenehol. K wabshaba pi has d ahga mam has i mahs ch ab i s‑wohoch g Jiosh. Heg at wehsijj ab i t‑hemakoch. K hahawa heg wa wepo mach d Jesus honshpadag. K g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag wehsijj an t‑uꞌukch. 
1CO12:14	The body is not made of one part, but many parts.  	Kuch eda nahnko mahs haꞌichu chikpan hab masma mo g nahnko chuhchuꞌidaj g t‑honshpadag.  
1CO12:15	If the foot were to say, “Because I'm not a hand, I'm not part of the body,” would that make it not part of the body?  	T‑tahtad o pi wepo haꞌichu hab wua mo g t‑nohnhoi. Kuch wabshaba wehs ha tatchua.  
1CO12:16	If the ear were to say, “Because I'm not an eye, I'm not part of the body,” would that make it not part of the body?  	K g t‑nahnk gawul haꞌichu hab wua mo g t‑wuhpui.  
1CO12:17	If the whole body was an eye, how could you hear anything? If the whole body was an ear, how could you smell anything? 	Kuch wabshaba wehs ha tatchua natt ge has masma haꞌichu wo kah mattp pi wo sha ha nahnkk ch pi has masma wo hewagi mattp pi wo sha ha dahkk.  
1CO12:18	But God has arranged each part in the body, every last one of them, placing them just as he wanted.  	Jiosh at am nahto g oꞌodham k hab masma hab juh g nahnko chuhchuꞌidag ab t‑honshpadag ab.  
1CO12:19-20	If they were all the same part, what would happen to the body?  However, since there are many parts, they make up the body.  	K wehs ab i e wehnadch g hab t‑chuhchuꞌidag no pi d hemako g t‑honshpadag. 
1CO12:21	The eye can't tell the hand, “I don't need you,” or the head tell the feet, “I don't need you.”  	Pi ach hegam waꞌi tatchua t‑wuhpui ch wabshaba g t‑nohnhoi ehp k ch pi heg waꞌi tatchua t‑moꞌo ch wabshaba g t‑tahtad ehp.  
1CO12:22	Quite the opposite: some of those parts of the body that seem the most insignificant are the most essential.  	Haꞌi o pi gewpkdag g hab t‑chuhchuꞌidag ch wabshaba hab wa masma d si t‑tatchui.  
1CO12:23	In fact those parts of the body we do not consider to be decent to reveal we “honor” more by covering them up—what is indecent we treat with greater modesty!  	Kuch s‑ap ha nuhkud ch ha maꞌishch mat pi wo mahsk hegam hab chuhchuꞌidag mo pi ta neidagma.  
1CO12:24	What's presentable doesn't need such covering up. God has so arranged the body that more honor is given to the parts that are less presentable.  	Pi ach hab masma s‑ha nenꞌoid hegam hab chuhchuꞌidag mo pi has d ahga mat wo e neidad.  
1CO12:25	This is so there wouldn't be any conflict within the body—the different parts should care equally for each other.  	Wehs ach ha tatchua g hab t‑chuhchuꞌidag mat wehs e wehm s‑ap wo chikpanad.  
1CO12:26	So when one part is suffering, all the other parts of the body suffer with it, and when one part is treated well, then all the other parts of the body are happy too! 	Pegih, bach wa masma chum t‑wehm s‑ap chikpan ch wehs t‑wehm wo t‑shoꞌigch mattp hema haꞌichukaj wo t‑shoꞌigch. Kutt wehs t‑wehm wo s‑hehgigk mamtp hema ab wo si s‑ap has t‑ah. 
1CO12:27	Now you are the body of Christ, and each one makes up a part of it.  	Pegih, wehsijj ach d hemako g Jesus Christ wehm ch heg wa wepo mach d honshpadaj ch heheꞌejel d nahnko chuhchuꞌidaj.  
1CO12:28	In the church, God has arranged first for some to be apostles, secondly for some to be prophets, thirdly teachers. Then there are those who perform miracles, those with healing gifts, those who can help others, those good at administration, and those who can speak different languages.  	Jiosh at wehs ab i t‑mahkhi matt haschu hab wo junidahid. K id d si wehs ha dahm t‑chikpan mach haꞌi d Jesus Christ chuhchai ch am ahgachugch g haꞌichu ahga ab amjed.

Pi att wehsijj gam hu mehk wo ahgachugad g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch pi wehsijj d Jiosh haꞌichu ahga i tashogiddam ch pi wehsijj d Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ha mashchamdam ch pi wehsijj uꞌukch g gewkdag matt hab wo junihid g s‑hasig haꞌichu

1CO13:8-10	Love never fails. Prophecies will come to an end. Tongues will become silent. Knowledge will become useless.  For our knowledge and our prophetic understanding are incomplete.  But when completeness comes, then what is incomplete disappears.

1CO13:13	Trust, hope, and love last forever—but the most important is love. 	Pegih, chum att hekid ab wo s‑wohochudad g Jiosh ch ab s‑ap wo nenidad mat am hab wo i junihid g e‑neꞌoki am t‑wehhejed. Chum att hekid wo si pihk t‑elidad ha hekaj. K g pihk elidadag wehs ha baꞌich d i si s‑has haꞌichu. 
1CO14:1	Make love your most important objective! But also do your best to gain spiritual gifts, especially the ability to speak God's message.  	Pegih, mt am wo e nakogad mamt ab wo si pikh e elidad wehs ha hekaj ch wo i ha wehmtad heg hekaj mo haschu ab t‑makiog g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag matt hab wo junihid. T id d wo si i ha‑wehmtadagk matt am wo ha ahgidad mo haschu g Jiosh am i t‑tashogid.  
1CO14:2	Those who speak in a tongue are not talking to people, but to God, because nobody can understand them as they speak mysteries in the Spirit.  	Pi at hedai hejel wo s‑em‑amichud k ab wo bei g i wehmtadag mamtp wabsh g pi e‑machiga neꞌokikaj wo neneokad. Heg o wa wepo mach heg hekaj ab waꞌi Jiosh wui neneok.  
1CO14:3	However, the words of those who speak for God build people up—they provide encouragement and comfort.  	K wabshaba hegai mo am ha ahgid mo haschu g Jiosh am i ha tashogid am i ha wehmaj ch am i ha gewkemhun ch ab ha mahk g s‑ap tahhadkam.  
1CO14:4	Those that speak in a tongue only build themselves up, but those who speak God's message build up the church. I would like it if you all spoke in tongues, but I'd prefer if you could speak God's message.  	Hejel o waꞌi e wehhejed hab kaij hegai mo gawul kaidam nenneok. K wabshaba hegai mo am ha ahgid mo haschu g Jiosh am i ha tashogid am i ha wehmaj g e‑wehm wohochuddam. 
1CO14:5	Those who speak for God are more important than those who speak in tongues, unless they interpret what's been said, so that the church can be built up. 	Mamt huꞌi wehsijj wo neneokad g pi e‑machiga neꞌokikaj. Ni wabshaba baꞌich i tatchua mamt wo bei hegai mahkigdag mamt si s‑ta amichudam wo ahgad g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.

1CO14:6	Brothers and sisters, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what benefit would I be to you unless I bring you some revelation, or knowledge, or prophetic message, or teaching?  	Pi ant haꞌichukaj wo shaꞌi i em‑wehmt mantp hems am wo jiwia em‑wui k heg waꞌi hekaj wo neokad pi ni‑machiga neꞌoki.

1CO14:7	Even when it comes to something non-living such as musical instruments like a flute or a harp: if they don't produce clear notes, how will you know what tune is being played?  	Id ant wo haꞌichu wepogi mamt wo s‑amich. S‑mahch am mat pi hedai wo s‑mahchk mo haschu neꞌi am chum aꞌaga matp g uhs kuikud ch ahlpa pi kehg wo kaida.  
1CO14:8	Similarly, if the trumpet doesn't give a clear sound, who will get ready for battle?  	T pi hedai wo s‑mahchk g shondal mat has wo e juh matp g kuhudam pi ap am hu wo kuhu g kuikud.  
1CO14:9	It's the same situation for you—unless you speak using words that are easy to understand, who will know what you're saying? What you say will be lost on the wind.  	Pegih, t hab wa masma pi hedai wo em‑amich mam haschu am chum aꞌaga mamtp wabsh gawul kaidam wo neokad. Heg o wa wepo mat an wabsh wo i huhug g em‑neꞌoki.  
1CO14:10	There are surely many languages in this world, and there is meaning in every one of them.  	Muꞌij o g nahnko mahs neꞌoki id dahm jewed.  
1CO14:11	If I don't understand the language, those who speak make no sense to me, and I make no sense to them. 	Mantp pi wo mahchk g neꞌokij g gawul neokdam, kutt d wabsh wo ge oꞌodhamk ab aꞌai t‑wui nach ge s‑t‑amichud.  
1CO14:12	It's the same for you—if you are keen to have spiritual gifts, try to have many of those that will build up the church.  	S‑apꞌe o mam si tatchua g mahkigdaj g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. Kumt baꞌich am hab wo i junihid mat haschu baꞌich d wo i ha‑wehmtadagk g em‑wehm wohochuddam. 
1CO14:13	Anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that they're able to translate what they say.  	Hegai mat hedai wo gawul kaidam nenneokad at hemho wa wo chum e hoꞌigeꞌidahun k ab wo tai g Jiosh g amichudadag mat s‑ap wo i tashogi g gawul kaidam e‑neꞌoki.  
1CO14:14	For if I pray out loud in a tongue, my spirit is praying, but it does nothing for my understanding! 	Pi att hedai am hu wo i ha wehmtad heg hekaj haꞌichu t‑amichudadag mattp wabsh g gawul kaidam neꞌokikaj wo t‑hoꞌigeꞌidahunad, chum achs si s‑ap t‑tahtk am heheꞌejel t‑iꞌibdag ed.  
1CO14:15	So then, what should I do? I will pray “in the Spirit,” but I will pray with my mind too. I will sing “in the Spirit,” but I will sing with my mind too.  	Kutt heg hekaj pi wabsh wo t‑hoꞌigeꞌidahunad g gawul kaidam neꞌokikaj ch pi wabsh wo neꞌed g gawul kaidam neꞌokikaj ch wabshaba s‑ta amichudam hab ep wo t‑juh.  
1CO14:16	For if you only pray “in the Spirit,” how can ordinary people that don't have understanding say “Amen” after your prayer of thanks, since they haven't a clue what you said?  	Pi at wo e nako hegam mo pi mahch mach has t‑wua mat t‑wehm ab wo hoꞌigeꞌel g Jiosh mattp wabsh g gawul kaidam neꞌokikaj wo t‑hoꞌigeꞌidahunad nat ge wo amich mach has kaij.  
1CO14:17	You might have said a great prayer of thanks, but the other hasn't been helped!  	Ttp hems hi wa si s‑ap wo t‑hoꞌigeꞌidahu Jiosh wui. T wabshaba idam pi ab hu wo bei g i wehmtadag. 
1CO14:18	I thank God that I can speak in tongues more than all of you.  	Ab o ep ni‑mahks ihda mahkigdag. Kuni ab si hoꞌigeꞌid g Jiosh mani em‑baꞌich i muꞌikko nenneok g gawul kaidam neꞌokikaj.  
1CO14:19	But in church I would rather speak five understandable words to teach others than ten thousand words in a tongue nobody understands.  	Nt wo ni‑nako mant heg hekaj muꞌi mihl neꞌoki hab wo chei. K wabshaba baꞌich i s‑apꞌe mach eda t‑mihshmad mant al hetasp neꞌoki hab wo chei mat wo s‑e amich mani haschu chum ha mashcham. 
1CO14:20	Brothers and sisters, don't think like children. Be as innocent as babies in regard to evil, but be grown up in your understanding.  	Aꞌalkaj am hab e junihim, ni‑wepnag, ab si haꞌichuchudch ihda al mahkigdag ch heg hekaj ab si e haschud. Am g wabsh wo dagito ihda pi apꞌekam. Neh, aꞌal o pi mahch g pi apꞌekam. Kumt hab waꞌi masma hab wo masmak mo g aꞌal mamt pi wo mahchk g pi apꞌekam.  
1CO14:21	As Scripture records, “ ‘I will speak to my people through other languages and the lips of foreigners, but even then they won't listen to me,’ says the Lord.” 	An o oꞌohadag mo hab kaij g Jiosh: 
1CO14:22	Speaking in tongues is a sign, not to believers, but those who don't believe. Speaking God's prophetic message is the opposite: it is not for those who don't believe, but for believers.  	Neh, idam gawul kaidam neꞌoki mam ab si haꞌichuchud o wa d chum chehgida am ha wehhejed hegam mo pi ab hu kaimk g Jiosh ch pi t‑wehhejed d chehgida ahchim wohochuddam. Hegai mo g Jiosh am t‑tashogid matt wo ha ahgi g t‑wehm wohochuddam o am ha chehgid mo am t‑wehmaj g Jiosh, chum as pi am hu wo ha chehgi hegam mo pi kaimk g Jiosh.  
1CO14:23	If the whole church is meeting together and you are all speaking in tongues, and some people come in who don't understand, or people who don't believe, won't they say that you are insane?  	T hegam mo s‑kaimk ch am wo i wahp t‑namki ed hab wo chei matt t‑loligoch mattp wabsh gawul kaidam wo nenneokad.  
1CO14:24	But if everyone is speaking God's message, and someone comes in who isn't a believer, or someone who doesn't understand, they will be convinced and called to account by everyone's words.  	Hemho wa att am wo tasho ahgad mat has chu g Jiosh am wo t‑tashogi matt wo ah. Kut wo s‑t‑amich g pi e doꞌibiakam k wo s‑mai moki d pi ap chuꞌijkam ch atki wo e lodai.  
1CO14:25	The secrets of their heart will be laid bare, so they will fall to their knees and worship God, affirming that God is truly among you. 	Wehs g haꞌichu t‑ahga at ab ha wui wo tashogi g s‑aꞌagi haꞌichu ha‑chegitoi. Kut ab wo i shul Jiosh wui k ab wo ihm k wo wohokamch moki woho am t‑wehmaj g Jiosh. 
1CO14:26	So then, brothers and sisters, what should you do? When you meet together, different people will sing, or teach, or share a special message, or speak in a tongue, or give an interpretation. But everything should be done to build up and encourage the church.  	Id ani hab ahg, ni‑wepnag, mamt wehs haꞌichu s‑ap am hab wo junihid e‑namki ed. Mtp hems hema am wo ah g neꞌi k hema g mashchama hab wo juh k hema wo ah mat haschu g Jiosh am wo i em‑maskogi k hema hems g gawul kaidam neꞌokikaj wo neo k hema am wo i tashogi mo has d ahga ihda neꞌoki. Wehs haꞌichu at d wo i chum em‑wehmta.  
1CO14:27	If anyone wants to speak in a tongue, make it just two, or three at the most, taking turns, and someone should interpret what is said.  	Mamtp wo neneo g gawul kaidam neꞌokikaj, mt am waꞌi waik o gohkajj hab wo juh shakal e oidam. Mt hema am wo i tashogi ihda mo am hab e kaij.  
1CO14:28	If there's no one there to interpret, those who speak in tongues should keep quiet in church and only speak to themselves, and God.  	Kumt pi am hu hab wo chum chei g gawul kaidam neꞌoki matp pi am hu hedai wo haꞌichugk mat am wo i tashogi k wabsh hejel e wehhejed ch ab Jiosh wui hab wo chei. 
1CO14:29	Similarly, have two or three of those who give God's prophetic message speak, and let everyone else think about what was said.  	Kumt waik o gohkajj am wo ah mat haschu g Jiosh ab wo em‑mah. Kumt haꞌijj am wo aꞌamich mo haschu am hab e kaij.  
1CO14:30	However if a special revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, then the first speaker should give way to them.  	Kumt wabshaba wo haꞌasa neo matp g Jiosh am hema ep wui wo haꞌichu i tashogi mat am hab wo chei.  
1CO14:31	You can all speak for God, one at a time, so that everyone can learn and be encouraged.  	Wehsijj am hiwgidas mamt am wo ah g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga hehemakoj. T hab wehsijj wo haꞌichu mahch k ab hekaj wo bei g i gewkemhunadag.  
1CO14:32	It is for those who speak for God to control their prophetic inspiration,  	Mt wo nenida g e‑apꞌedag mat hekid g Jiosh ab wo em‑mah g haꞌichu e‑ahga am ha wehhejed.  
1CO14:33	for God is not a God of disorder but of peace and quiet.  This is the way it should be in all the churches of God's people.  	Pi o tatchua g Jiosh matt wabsh wo has hu t‑wuad ch wabshaba matt wo s‑dodolimak. 
1CO14:34	“Women should stay quiet in the churches—they shouldn't speak. They should respect their situation, as the laws states.  	Ahpim uꞌuwi amt ab wabsh wo ha wechok. Bo masma hab chuꞌig g heki hu t‑himdag chehanig. Pi amt has wo chei ab amjed mo has i kaij g chechoj  
1CO14:35	If they want to learn they can do so at home, asking their husbands. It is not proper  for women to speak in church.” 	k wabshaba ab wo ha kakke g e‑wehm kihkam am e‑kihki am mamtp wo haꞌichu s‑mahchim. Dat wo si edadagk mamtp ab wo ha kakke mam am e mihshmad. 
1CO14:36	What? Did the word of God begin with you? Are you the only ones it came to?  	Pi g hab wo elidad mas ahpim em‑gahi wuhshanim ab i wuhsh g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga o mams ahpim ab waꞌi bei.  
1CO14:37	Anyone who thinks they are a prophet, or that they have some spiritual gift, should be aware that what I'm writing to you is a command of the Lord.  	Mt wo chum s‑mahchk mo id d Jiosh chehanig mamtp hedai hab e elid mam d Jiosh haꞌichu ahgdam ch edgid g gewkdaj g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag.  
1CO14:38	Those who ignore this will themselves be ignored.  	Kumt pi ab hu wo ha kaiha matp hedai pi ab hu wo kaiha ihda. 
1CO14:39	So my brothers and sisters, make it your aim to speak for God. Don't prohibit speaking in tongues.  	Pegih neh, ni‑wepnag, am g wo si i e gewpkad mamt wo ah g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga k wabshaba pi wo ha daꞌi hegam mat g gawul kaidam neꞌokikaj wo nenneokad.  
1CO14:40	Just make sure everything done is done properly and in an orderly manner. 	Wehs amt haꞌichu si s‑ap am hab wo junihid e‑namki ed ch pi wabsh wo has hu e wuad. 
1CO15:1	Now I want to remind you about the good news I announced to you. You accepted it, and you have stood firm for it.  	Am ant ep wo em‑ahgi ihda s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh, ni‑wepnag. Ab amt i s‑wohoch mant eda am em‑ahgi heki hu k s‑wihnam gegok am e‑wohochudadag ed.  
1CO15:2	It is through this good news that you are saved if you hold on to the message that I gave you. Otherwise you trusted for nothing!  	Do ihda s‑kehg haꞌichu ahga mamt heg hekaj wo e doꞌibia mamtp woho an uꞌukch. 
1CO15:3	I passed on to you what I myself had also received, a message of vital importance: that Christ died for our sins, according to Scripture;  	Am ant em‑ahgi mant haschu bei. K id d si s‑has haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh ch hab chuꞌig mat g alidaj muh heg hekaj pi ap t‑chuꞌijig  
1CO15:4	he was buried and was raised from the dead on the third day, again in accordance with Scripture.  	k uhpam ep e chegito mo am d i waik tash mamt am woi cheo ch ed hab masma mo an oꞌohadag Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana ed mat am hab wo e juh.  
1CO15:5	He appeared to Peter, then to the Twelve.  	Am at i e chehgi Peter wui k ab hahawa wehs ha wui g am e‑chuhchai  
1CO15:6	After that he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still alive today, though some have died.  	k am ep i e chehgi ha wui g hetasp siant i baꞌiwichkim mo ab d wohochuddam. Muꞌijj idam o an d wabsh kia dodakam. T haꞌijj hi wa koi.  
1CO15:7	He appeared to James, then all the apostles.  	Am at hahawa ep i e chehgi e‑wehnag James wui k ab ep ha wui wehs g am e‑chuhchai  
1CO15:8-9	Last of all, he also appeared to me, someone born as it were at the wrong time.  For I'm the least important apostle of all, not even fit to be called an apostle since I persecuted God's church.  	k am si ha oidch hab waꞌap i e chehgi ab ni‑wui. Ni eda s‑koꞌokam ha shoꞌigchud hegam mo ab s‑wohochud. K pi ab hu d chum ni‑wuikam manis d wo kehshajk. T wabshaba wa am ni‑wui i e chehgid k ab i ni‑waid k am i ni‑kei.  
1CO15:10	But by God's grace I am what I am, and his grace given to me wasn't wasted. On the contrary I've worked harder than all of them—though not me, but God's grace working through me.  	Bat wa masma si s‑ni‑hoꞌigeꞌel g Jiosh. Kuni heg hekaj d kehshaj ch chum hems wehs ha baꞌich i si chikpan hegam mo am d chuhchaij. K eda d Jiosh mo hab junihim ihda. Pi ani hejel hab junihim.  
1CO15:11	So whether it's I or them, this is the message we shared with you that brought you to trust in God. 	K g Jiosh hab waꞌap i ha wehmt hegam mo ni‑wehm d piongaj g Jiosh. Wehsijj ach heg am wa ahgachug. K d ihda haꞌichu t‑ahga mam ab s‑wohochud. 
1CO15:12	Now if the message declares that Christ has been raised from the dead, how is it that some of you say there's no resurrection of the dead?  	Id o d haꞌichu t‑mashchama mat uhpam ep e chegito g Christ. Msh eda haꞌi hab chechꞌe mat pi hedai uhpam ep wo e chegito.  
1CO15:13	If there's no resurrection of the dead then Christ hasn't been raised either.  	Pegih, t g Christ hab waꞌap pi ep e chegito matp wo wohok mat pi hedai ep wo e chegito.  
1CO15:14	And if Christ isn't raised, then our message we shared with you is pointless, and your trust in God is pointless too.  	Kut pi d wo haꞌichuk machs hekaj wo em‑mihshmad o mams ab wo s‑wohoch.  
1CO15:15-16	In addition, we would be shown to be false witnesses of God when we testified that God raised Christ from the dead. But God didn't raise Christ from the dead if it's true that there's no resurrection.  If the dead are not raised, then Christ hasn't been raised either,  	T d wabsh wo iattogik mattp wo em‑ahgi mat g Jiosh ab i wuhshad g e‑alidag.  
1CO15:17	and if Christ hasn't been raised, then your trust in God is useless, and you are still in your sins.  	Kumt pi wo shaꞌi e doꞌibia. T pi haꞌichu wehhejed wo s‑kehgajk g em‑wohochudadag.  
1CO15:18	This also means that those who died in Christ are lost.  	T hab waꞌap pi wo e doꞌibia hegam mat heki hu koi ab i s‑wohochudk g haꞌichu t‑ahga ab amjed g Christ.  
1CO15:19	If our hope in Christ is only for this life, we're the most pitiful people of all! 	Shaꞌatt waꞌi si shoꞌig hab wo mahsk wehs ha baꞌiwichkim ahchim wohochuddam mattp pi uhpam ep wo t‑chegito. 
1CO15:20	But Christ <span class="it">has</span> been raised from the dead, the firstfruits  of the harvest from those who have died.  	T wabshaba woho ab i wuhsh g Christ muhkig amjed k am i shonwuich mat wo i wuwha g koꞌi.  
1CO15:29	Otherwise what will those people do who are baptized for the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why then would people be baptized for them? 	Neh, haꞌijj at g em‑tatchui ab i s‑wohoch g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh k hahawa koi. Kumt haꞌi hab waꞌap ab i s‑wohochud k e pahl wapko mamt wo ha wehmajk am i koꞌok. Pegih, pi g hab wo chehꞌi mas pi ep wo e chegito.  
1CO15:30	As for us, why do we place ourselves in danger hour after hour?  	Wehs tashkaj ach pi shaꞌi huwid g t‑doakag ahchim mach am ahgachug g doꞌibiadag. Kutt pi am hab wo t‑junihid matp pi ab hu wo i wuwha g koꞌi.  
1CO15:31	I die every day—let me say it bluntly, my brothers and sisters. This is just as sure as the pride I have for what Christ Jesus has done in you.  	Neh, ni‑wepnag, wehs tashkaj o am hab chuꞌig g s‑ni‑mukimkam. Id ani hab kaij nani pi ab si has em‑elid mam d ni‑wehm wohochuddam.  
1CO15:32	Humanly speaking, what would I gain by fighting with those people in Ephesus who were like wild animals, if the dead are not raised? If the dead are not raised, “let's eat and drink, for tomorrow we die”! 	Ia at haꞌi hab masma ni‑cheggia mo g s‑ta ehbidam haꞌichu dodakam Ephesus t am. Kunt pi ab hu ha wui wo shaꞌi kekiwua am ahgachugch matt ep wo t‑chegito am i koꞌok matp pi d wo wohokamk.

1CO15:33	Don't be fooled: “bad company ruins good character.”  	Mt wo e iattogid k hab waꞌap wo masmak mo hegam mamtp ab wo ha kaihamad.  
1CO15:34	Come to your senses as you should, and stop sinning! Some of you don't know God. I tell you this to shame you. 	Haꞌijj amki pi mahch g Jiosh. K id d si em‑edadag. Am g wabsh wo dagito g pi ap e‑chegitoi k s‑ap haꞌichu wo chegito. 
1CO15:35	Of course somebody will ask, “How exactly are the dead raised? What kind of body will they have?”  	Neh, haꞌijj amsh hab chechꞌe, “Shaht masma ep wo i wuwha g koꞌi. Kut has wo mahskad g hohon matp woho hab wo e juh?” 
1CO15:36	What a foolish question! What you sow doesn't sprout into life unless it dies.  	Pegih, nt wo em‑tashogi. T‑hohon o wepogidas mo g haꞌichu kai. Heg at am wo e ei jewed ch ed. T g elidaj wo padt. T g kai am haha wo i wuhsh.  
1CO15:37	When you sow, you don't sow the plant it will grow into, just the bare seed, whether wheat or whatever you're planting.  	Hegai mam am eꞌesha o d wabsh si s‑wohom haꞌichu kai ch pi d wehs hegai mat ab wo i wuhsh.  
1CO15:38	God makes the plant grow into the form he has chosen, and different seeds produce different plants with different forms.  	Jiosh at hab masma am wo wuhshad mo has i masma tatchua k ab mahkch mat hab wo mahskad mo g jeꞌej. Wehs o gawul mahs g haꞌichu wuhshanig.  
1CO15:39	What living things are made from is not the same. Human beings have one kind of body tissue, while animals have another, birds another, and fish another.  	K g haꞌichu doakam hab waꞌap gawul mahs. Oꞌodham o am wa has mahs chuhkug. K g haꞌichu doakam ch uꞌuwhig ch waptopi am wa heheꞌejelko gawul mahs chuhkug. 
1CO15:40	There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. Heavenly bodies have one kind of beauty, earthly bodies another.  	Tash ch mashad ch huhuꞌu o gawul masma mo g jewed ch gawul masma s‑kehgaj.  
1CO15:41	The sun shines in one way, and the moon another, while the stars are different again, with each one shining in a different way. 	K idam mo an t‑dahm hab chuꞌig pi e wepo masma s‑kehgaj. Mashad o gawul masma s‑kehgaj mo g tash. K g huhuꞌu hab waꞌap gawul masma s‑kehgaj mo idam ch pi e wepo masma s‑kehgaj. 
1CO15:42-44	It's the same with the resurrection of the dead. The body is sown in decay; it is raised to last forever.  It is sown in shame; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.  It is sown as a natural body; it is raised as a spiritual body. Just as there are natural bodies there are spiritual bodies.

Tsh id g Jiosh am nahto k ab mah g doakag k Hekaj am i shonwuich g oꞌodham doakag. K wabshaba g Christ ab hahawa t‑mahkch g wechij doakag.

1CO15:54	When this perishable body has been clothed with a body that never perishes, and this mortal life has been clothed with immortality, then the Scripture will come true that says, “Death has been totally conquered and destroyed.  	T hab masma wo e wohokamch ihda mo an hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed: 
1CO15:55-57	Death—where's your victory? Death—where's your sting?” The sting that causes death is sin; and the power of sin is the law;  but praise God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.

1JN01:3	What we have seen and heard we are now explaining to you, so that you may also share in this friendship together with us—this friendship that is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.  	Ahchim mach wa neid g Jiosh alidag ach am em-ahgid ab amjed mamt hekaj t-wehm ab wo ihmad g Jiosh. Jesus Christ o d Jiosh alidag.

1JN01:5	This is the message we received from him and that we declare to you: God is light, and there is absolutely no darkness in him at all.  	Jesus o am t-ahgid mash g Jiosh d hekia tonlig.  
1JN01:6	If we claim to share this friendship with him and yet go on living in darkness, we're lying, and not living in the truth.  	T wo ha iattogi matp hedai hab wo chei mo s-mahch g Jiosh k eda hab wo junihid g pi apꞌekam. Id o am s-chuhugam k ed him.  
1JN01:7	But if we are living in the light, as he is in the light, then we share in this friendship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, makes us clean from every sin.

1JN01:9	But if we confess our sins, he is trustworthy and right so that he can forgive us our sins and make us clean from all that is not right in us.  	Tt wo mahsko wua g t-chuꞌijig.

1JN02:1	My dear children, I'm writing this to you so you shouldn't sin. But if anybody should happen to sin, we have someone who defends us before the Father—Jesus Christ, who is truly right.  	Dam ni-aꞌaliga ab i s-wohochudk g haꞌichu ni-ahga. Kuni ab i em-gewkemhun mamt pi am hu hab wo junihid g pi apꞌekam. Jesus Christ o d hekia s-apꞌekam ch ab e hoꞌigeꞌidahun Jiosh wui am t-wehhejed.

1JN02:3	We can be sure that we do know him if we follow his commands.  	Tt wo s-mahchk mach wohoꞌi s-mahch g Jiosh matt am hab wo junihid mo haschu ab i t-chehani.  
1JN02:4	Anyone who says, “I know him,” but doesn't do what he says, is a liar. They don't have the truth.  	Hegai mat pi am hu oidk hab wo e junihid g Jiosh chehanig o pi mahch g Jiosh, chum as hems hab wo chum chei mo s-mahch.  
1JN02:5	But those who follow God's word have his love totally fill their hearts. This is how we know that we live in him.  	Ahchim mach hab wua g Jiosh tatchui ach wohoꞌi ab si tatchua. Id at am wo t-chehgi mach woho d aꞌaligaj.

1JN02:7	My friends, I'm not writing to you giving some new commandment, but an old commandment you've had from the beginning. This old commandment is one you have already heard.  	Pegih, ni-tatchui, pi ani em-ahgid g wechij chehanig am em-ahgidch mamt ab aꞌai wo si e tatchuad. Jiosh o wa heki hu hab masma t-chehani. Kum id ab kaichug heki hu waꞌi amjed.  
1JN02:8	But in a sense I am giving you a new commandment. Its truth is revealed in Jesus and in you, for the darkness is coming to an end and the true light is already shining.  	T eda g Jiosh alidag am i wechijid t-wehhejed mat ab i t-mah g wechij doakag. Tonlig o gam hu hab i wua g s-chuhugam am t-wehhejed.

1JN02:10	Those who love their fellow Christians live in the light, and don't cause others to sin. 	Tt am tonlig ch ed wo hihimad mattp woho ab wo si ha tatchuad g t-wepnag. T pi hedai wo pihk chuꞌi heg hekaj mach has masma.  
1JN02:11	Those who hate a fellow Christian are in darkness. They stumble around in the dark, not knowing where they're going because the darkness has blinded them. 	K wabshaba am s-chuhugam k ed him hegai matp hedai wo s-ha kehꞌidad. 
1JN02:12	Dear friends, I'm writing to you children, for your sins have been forgiven through the name of Jesus.  	Pi ant hab ahgk am wo em-oꞌohani mams pi mahch g Jiosh. Gm at hu hab i juh g em-chuꞌijig. Kum s-mahch.  
1JN02:13-14	I'm writing to you fathers, for you know him who has existed from the beginning. I'm writing to you young people, for you have defeated the Evil One.  I write to you little children, for you know the Father. I write to you fathers, for you know him who has existed from the beginning. I write to you young people, for you are strong. The word of God lives in you, and you have defeated the Evil One. 	Ahpim mam d si geꞌeged am s-mahch mo g Jesus chum hekid d doakam.

1JN02:16	For all the things of this world—our sinful desires, wanting everything we see, boasting about what we've accomplished in life— these things don't come from the Father but from the world.

1JN02:22	Who is the liar?—anyone who denies that Jesus is the Christ. The antichrist is anyone who denies the Father and the Son.  	Hegam mo hab kaij mo g Jesus pi d Jiosh alidag o wehs ha baꞌich d i s-chu iꞌattomkam ch d obgaj. Heg o hekaj e chehgid mo pi ab hu wohochud g Jiosh.

1JN02:24	As for you, make sure what you heard from the beginning continues to live in you. If what you heard from the beginning lives in you, you will also live in the Son and in the Father.

1JN02:27	But the anointing you received from him means the Spirit lives in you, and you don't need to be taught by anyone. The Spirit's anointing teaches you about everything. It is the truth and not a lie. So live in Christ, just as you've been taught! 	Pi o hab chum mahs mams wabsh chum hasko amjed wo i e gahgidahi mam haschu i pi amichud.

1JN03:1	Look at the amazing kind of love the Father has for us! This is why we can be called God's children—for that's who we are! The reason why the people of this world don't recognize us as God's children is because they don't recognize him.  	Jiosh at hab t-juh mach d hahawa aꞌaligaj no pi si pihk e elid ab t-wui.

1JN03:12	We cannot be like Cain, who belonged to the Evil One, and murdered his brother. Why did he murder him? Because Cain did what was evil, while his brother did what was right.  	Neh, hema ash wa d Cain ch hab junihim g Jiawul tatchui. Kumt pi oidk am hab wo e junihid. Cain cheoj wehnag ash wa hab junihim g s-apꞌekam. Sh g Jiosh si tatchua.

1JN03:14	The reason we know that we have changed from death to life is because we love our Christian brothers and sisters. Anyone who doesn't love remains dead.

1JN03:16	This is how we know what love is: Jesus laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for our Christian brothers and sisters.

1JN03:17	If one of you is living well in this world and you see your Christian brother or sister in need, but you don't show compassion—how can God's love be living in you?  	Pi o shaꞌi pihk e elid ab Jiosh wui hegai mat hedai haꞌichu wo s-edgidad ch pi heg hekaj ab hu wo i wehmt g e-wehnag.

1JN04:1	Dear friends, don't trust every spirit, but put the spirits to the test to find out whether they're from God, for there are many false prophets out there in the world.

1JN04:3	while every spirit that doesn't accept Jesus, that spirit isn't from God. In fact it is the spirit of the antichrist which you heard was coming, and which is already in the world.

1JN04:6	We belong to God and whoever knows God listens to us, while whoever doesn't belong to God doesn't listen to us. This is how we can distinguish the spirit of truth from the spirit of deception. 	Pi o ab hu t-kaiham mach chum neneok ab amjed g Jiosh no pi pi mahch g Jiosh.

1JN04:7	Dear friends, let's go on loving one another, for love comes from God. All those who love are born of God and know God.  	Ab att wo chum si pihk t-elidad aꞌai t-wui no pi g Jiosh ab t-mahkch g pihk elidadag. Mamtp woho wo s-mahchk g Jiosh ch d aꞌaligaj ch wo si pihk e elidad.

1JN04:9-10	How was God's love shown to us? God sent his one and only Son into the world so that we could live through him.  This is love! It's not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and he sent his Son to be the reconciliation for our sins. 	Jiosh at ab i wuhshad g si hemako e alidag id dahm jewed. T heg ab nako g s-koꞌok t-namkidadag mach heg ab beihog. Kut hab masma ab t-mah g wechij doakag. Bat wa masma am t-tashogi g Jiosh mo si pihk e elid ab t-wui. Kutt heg amjed i s-mai g pihk elidadag k hahawa si pihk t-elid ab Jiosh wui.  
1JN04:11	Friends, if this is the way God loves us, we ought to love one another like this too.  	Am o wa tasho mo ab t-wui si pihk e elid g Jiosh. Pegih, ni-wepnag, ahchim att hab waꞌap wo chum si pihk t-elidad ab aꞌai t-wui.  
1JN04:12	No one has ever seen God. However, if we love one another then God lives in us, and his love is fulfilled in us.  	Pi ach hedai hekid shaꞌi neid g Jiosh g t-wuhpuikaj. K wabshaba heg ab t-mahkch g si geꞌe pihk elidadag. Kuch heg hekaj s-mahch mo t-wehmaj. 
1JN04:13	How can we know that we live in him, and that he lives in us? He's given us the ability to love by his Spirit. 	Jiosh at ab t-mah g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag. K heg d Jiosh ch ab t-wehm kihdag. Kuch heg hekaj s-mahch mach d aꞌaligaj.  
1JN04:14	For we are witnesses to what we have seen and testify that the Father sent the Son as the Savior of the world.  	Heki at hu am i kei g Jiosh g e-alidag mat ab wo i hih jewed wui k wo ha doꞌibia g hemajkam. Kuni si neid ihda ch heg amjed am em-ahgid.

1JN04:16	We have experienced and trusted in the love that God has for us. God is love, and those who live in love, live in God, and God lives in them.  	Kuch heg hekaj s-mahch mo si pihk e elid g Jiosh ab t-wui ch ab si t-hemakojidch e wehm. 
1JN04:17	This is how love is made complete in us so that we can be confident on judgment day: by the fact that we live just like him in this world.  	Ab o t-mahkch g si geꞌe pihk elidadag. Kuch wepo masma ab si tatchua mo g alidaj ch hab s-ap t-taht k wo ai g lodaita  
1JN04:18	Where there is love there can be no fear. God loves us completely, and this love drives all our fears away. If we do fear, it's because we fear being punished, and this shows that we have not been fully re-made by the completeness of God's love.  	k pi wo ehbidad. Gm at hu hab i juh g pi ap t-namkidadag g Jiosh no pi si pihk e elid ab t-wui. Kutt heg hekaj pi wo ehbidad ch wabsh aigo wo si pihk t-elidad ab wui.

1JN04:19	We love because he loved us first.  	Wehpeg o si pihk e elid g Jiosh ab t-wui. Kuch heg hekaj edgid g pihk elidadag.  
1JN04:20	Anyone who says, “I love God,” but hates a Christian brother or sister, is a liar. Anyone who doesn't love a brother whom they can see, can't love God whom they can't see.  	Pi o woho d Jiosh wohochuddam mo hedai pi ab hu pihk e elid t-wui ahchim mach d wohochuddam. Baꞌich o i s-hasig matt ab wo si tatchua hegai mach pi neid. Pi at wo e nako mat ab wo si tatchua g Jiosh matp hedai pi ab hu wo si ha tatchua g e-wepnag.  
1JN04:21	This is the command he gave to us: those who love God love their brothers and sisters too. 	Ab o t-chehani g Jiosh ahchim mach ab si tatchua matt ab epai wo si ha tatchuad g t-wepnag. 
1JN05:1	Whoever trusts that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and whoever loves the father also loves his child.  	Dach Jiosh aꞌaliga wehsijj ahchim mach s-wohochud mo g Jesus d alidaj g Jiosh ch d si Kehshaj. Kutt ab aꞌai wo si t-tatchuad nach pi d t-wepngam. K g Jiosh d t-ohg.  
1JN05:2	How do we know that we love God's children? When we love God and follow his commands.  	S-mahch ach mo d wohokam g t-tatchuidag ab aꞌai t-wui nach pi ab si tatchua g Jiosh.  
1JN05:3	Loving God means that we follow his commands, and his commands are not hard to bear.  	K am wa tasho mach ab si tatchua g Jiosh nach pi ab s-wohog elid. K g chehanigaj pi shaꞌi wehch am t-wehhejed.  
1JN05:4-5	Everyone who is born of God defeats the world. The way we gain victory and defeat the world is by trusting God.  Who can defeat the world? Only those who trust in Jesus, believing he is the Son of God.  	Jiosh o ab t-mahkch g gewkdag matt wo gewito g pi apꞌekam. Ab ach s-wohochud g alidaj. K heg hekaj ab t-mahkch hegai gewkdag matt heg hekaj gewito g pi apꞌekam. Pi at wo e nako g pi wohochuddam mas wo gewito g pi apꞌekam. 
1JN05:6	He is the one who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ. He did not only come by water, but by water and blood.  The Spirit gives evidence to confirm this, for the Spirit is the truth.  	Jesus Christ at ia jiwia jewed dahm k e pahl wakon k am hab juh g e-chikpan k am hahawa e muhkid am t-wehhejed.  
1JN05:7-8	So there are three that give evidence:  the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and all three agree as one. 	T g pahl wakonaj ch muhkigaj am wohokamch mo d Jiosh alidag ch d doakam id dahm jewed. K g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag hab waꞌap wohokamchud. Idam waik o am wohokamchud mo g Jesus d Jiosh alidag.  
1JN05:9	If we accept the evidence that human witnesses provide, then the evidence that God provides is much more important. The evidence that God provides is his testimony about his Son.  	Neh, ab ach s-wohochud g oꞌodham mat ab haꞌijj wo t-ahgi mo si s-ap s-mahch. K g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga baꞌich i s-gewkdag mat heg am wohokamch g e-alidag.  
1JN05:10	Those trusting in the Son of God have accepted and hold on to this evidence. Those who don't trust God make God out to be a liar, because they don't believe the evidence God has given about his Son.  	Kutt hedai ab wo s-wohoch g Jiosh alidag k wo si s-ap s-mahchk mo d wohokam. Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag at t-wehhejed wo wohokamch. Hegam mo pi wohochud g Jiosh oki hab elid mo t-iattogid.  
1JN05:11	The evidence is this: God has given eternal life to us, and we have this life through his Son.  	Ab o i t-tashogid g Jiosh mo ab t-makiog g pi ha huhugedam doakag am gahi wuhshanim g e-alidag.  
1JN05:12	Whoever has the Son has life; whoever doesn't have the Son of God doesn't have life.  	Ahchim mach ab ihm g alidaj ach edgid hegai doakag. K hegam mo pi ab hu ihm pi edgid. 
1JN05:13	I'm writing to tell those of you who trust in the name of the Son of God so you can be certain you have eternal life.  	Id ant am em-oꞌohani ahpim mam ab ihm g Jiosh alidag mamt hekaj wo s-mahchk mam edgid ihda wechij doakag.  
1JN05:14-15	We can be confident that he will listen to us as long as we ask in accordance with his will.  If we know that he hears our requests, we can be sure that we will receive what we've asked him for.  	Si ach s-mahch mat ab wo t-kaiha g Jiosh matt ab haꞌichu wo tai matp id am tatchuij oidch d wo haꞌichuk. Kutt heg hekaj ab wo i t-gewkemhunad ch ab wo haꞌichu tahnid nat pi woho am hab wo t-junidahid. 
1JN05:16	If you see your Christian brother or sister committing a sin that is not a deadly sin, you ought to pray and God will grant life to the one who's sinned. (But not for a deadly sin. There's a sin that is deadly, and I'm not saying people should pray about that.  	Ab att wo tahnid g Jiosh mat gam hu hab wo i juh g ha-chuꞌijig g t-wehm wohochuddam matp ab wo e shohbi. Kut hab wo juh mach haschu ab tahni. Pi ani em-ahgid mams wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahu ha wehhejed hegam mat pi ab hu wo shaꞌi e shohbi.  
1JN05:17	Yes, all that is not right is sin, but there's sin that is not deadly). 	Wehs o haꞌichu d pi apꞌekam mo haschu i pi d Jiosh tatchui. T wabshaba g Jiosh gam hu hab wo i juh g ha-chuꞌijig hegam mat ab wo e shohbi. 
1JN05:18-19	We recognize that those who are born of God don't keep on sinning. The Son of God  protects them and the devil cannot harm them.  We know that we belong to God, and that the world is under the power of the Evil One.  	S-mahch ach mo g Jiawul edgid g gewkdag am wehs ha dahm hegam mo pi d Jiosh aꞌaliga.

1JN05:20	We also know that the Son of God has come, and has helped us to understand so we can recognize the one who is true. We live in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God, and is eternal life. 	K g Jiosh alidag ab t-mahkch g amichudadag matt wo s-mahchk g wohokam Jiosh ch wo edgidad g wechij doakag. Heg at hekaj ia jiwia g Jiosh alidag jewed dahm.

1PE01:2	You were chosen by God the Father in his wisdom, made holy by the Spirit, so that you might obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood. May you have grace and peace more and more!

1PE01:7	These prove that your trust in God is genuine, just as fire is used to prove if gold is genuine—even though that too can be destroyed—and your faith is more valuable than gold! In this way your trust in God will be recognized and you will receive praise, glory, and honor when Jesus Christ appears.

1PE01:12	It was explained to them that they were not doing this for themselves, but for you—since what they spoke about you've now learned from those who shared the good news with you by the Holy Spirit that heaven sent. Even the angels are eager to find out about all this! 	S-mahch ash mat pi wabsh hejel e wehhejed oꞌoha hegai mash am ha wui i e tashogid.

1PE02:20	However there's no credit when you're punished for doing something wrong. But if you suffer for doing what is right, and you put up with it, then God's grace is with you.

1PE02:23	and when he was badly treated, he didn't retaliate. When he suffered, he didn't threaten to take revenge. He simply placed himself in the hands of the one who always judges rightly.

1PE03:7	Husbands, in just the same way, be considerate to your wives as you live together with them. Though she may not be as strong as you are, you should honor her since she will inherit equally with you God's gift of life. Make sure to do this so nothing will get in the way of your prayers.

1PE03:9	Don't pay back evil for evil, or retaliate when you're abused, instead you should give a blessing—because that's what you were called to do, so you could gain a blessing yourself.  	Pi g am wo e agwua g pi apꞌekamkaj k pi ab hu wo i nodagi g pi kehg neꞌoki. Ab o t‑ab matt ab wabsh wo i s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌel. T g Jiosh ab epai wo i s‑t‑hoꞌigeꞌel nat pi heg hekaj ab i t‑wai.

Don't be scared over what people threaten, don't worry about it;  	Tp hab wo mahsk mamt wo e shoꞌigch am hab junihidch g s‑apꞌekam, mt wabsh wo s‑ap e tahtkkad nat pi g Jiosh ab wo wa s‑em‑hoꞌigeꞌel heg hekaj.

1PE03:15	just keep your mind focused on Christ as Lord. Always be ready to explain to anyone who asks you the reason for the hope that you have. Do this in a gentle and respectful way.  	Ab g wo has elidad g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ ch chum hekid wo e nahtokchid mamt s‑ap wo ahgi mat hedai ab wo i em‑kakke mam haschu wui ab e gewpkadch.  
1PE03:16	Make sure your conscience is clear, so that if anyone makes accusations against you, they will be embarrassed for speaking badly about the good way you live your life in Christ.  	Kumt wabsh si s‑ap e taht k wabsh s‑hemajim ab wo ha ahgi. 
1PE03:17	It's certainly better to suffer for doing good, (if that's what God wants), than to suffer for doing wrong!  	S‑apꞌe o matt wo t‑shoꞌigch am hab junihidch g s‑apꞌekam matp d wo Jiosh tatchuik. K wabshaba d si edadag mattp am hab wo junihid g pi apꞌekam ch hekaj wo t‑shoꞌigch.  
1PE03:18	Jesus died because of sins, once and for all, the One completely true and right for those who are bad, so that he could bring you to God. He was put to death in the body, but he came to life in the spirit. 	Jesus Christ o d hekia s‑apꞌekam ch wa eda e shoꞌigch. Pegih, tt ahchim hab waꞌap wo t‑shoꞌigch. 
1PE03:19	He went to speak to those “imprisoned” 	Id gahi wuhshanim Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag o wa g Jesus Christ am ha mihshmad hegam mo hemu d koꞌi ch gam hu si kuhpi.  
1PE03:20	that refused to believe, when God patiently waited in the time of Noah while the ark was being built. Only a few—in fact eight people—were saved “through water.”  	Jiosh ash wa si s‑hemajim ab ha nenida g hemajkam mash eda g Noahbad ab s‑wohog elid ch nahtohim g geꞌe wahlko.

1PE03:21	This water symbolizes baptism that now saves you, not by washing off dirt from your body, but as a positive response to God that comes from a clear conscience. It is the resurrection of Jesus Christ that makes your salvation possible.  	Id ani wepogid g t‑pahl wakonadag. Heg att hekaj am t‑chehgi mach s‑wohochud mat g Jesus Christ s‑ap gahi wuhsh g muhkig am t‑wehhejed. Tt ahchim hab waꞌap s‑ap wo gahi wuwha.

Kush g Jiosh ab si has elid an e‑hugid an dahshch e‑kownal daikud an. Kush g anghil ch nahnko mahs gewpkdag an dahm kahchim ch ed ab wecho. 
1PE04:1	Since Christ suffered physically, you must prepare yourselves with the same attitude he had—for those who suffer physically have turned away from sin.

1PE04:4	People think it's strange that you don't join them anymore in this wild and excessive lifestyle, so they curse at you. But they will have to explain what they've done to the One who is ready to judge the living and the dead.  	Hemu at e ai mamt haꞌasa hab juh hegai hab mahs pi apꞌekam. K g em‑wehm oꞌodham hahawa pi em‑amichud ch ab si has em‑ahg.

Anyone who wants to help others should do so through the strength that God gives, so that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. May glory and power be his forever and ever. Amen.

Do this willingly, not looking to make a profit from it.  Don't be arrogant, lording it over those who have been put in your care, but be an example to the flock.

1TH01:9	In fact they talk about what a marvelous welcome you gave us, how you abandoned idols and turned to God, how you serve the true and living God,  	Si amt s-ap ab i t-neid k ab i s-wohoch g s-wohokam Jiosh k gam hu ha dagito hegam mo d wabsh hemajkam ha-nahtoi.

1TH01:10	as you look forward to the coming of his Son from heaven—Jesus, the one God raised from the dead, who will save us from the judgment to come.

1TH02:1	Brothers and sisters, you yourselves know what our visit meant to you, and that it wasn't wasted!  	Am am wa s-mahch ahpim t-wehm wohochuddam mat s-ap haꞌichu am hab e juh heg hekaj matt am dada am ahgachugch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.  
1TH02:2	You'll recall that after having had much trouble and bad treatment at Philippi, with the help of God we still dared to share God's good news with you, despite the opposition we faced.  	Am ach wa em-ahgid mat haꞌi t-shoꞌigch amai Philippi kihhim t am matt eda koi am hu dada em-wui. T wabshaba g Jiosh ab i t-mah g gewkdag. Kutt am wabsh s-chechojim ahgachug g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj em-wui, chum as muꞌi ab t-wui gegok.  
1TH02:3	For what we speak about isn't deceptive, or worthless, or fraudulent. 	Haꞌichu t-chegitoidag o am wabsh si s-apꞌe. Pi ach em-iattogid ch wabshaba wabsh s-chechojim ahg g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga mamt ab wui wo i e dagito.  
1TH02:4	On the contrary, we have God's approval for what we say—he's entrusted us with sharing the good news. We don't set out to please people, but God. He's the one who judges our motives.  	Jiosh at t-aꞌappem k am i t-chuhcha matt wo i ahgahi g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj. Kuch heg hab waꞌi junihim mo haschu d tatchuij ch pi wabsh g hemajkam ha-tatchui hab junimk. Jiosh o am t-mamche mach haschu ahgch hab haꞌichu junihim.  
1TH02:5	As you know, we've never used flattering words. Nor were we covering up some greedy, selfish attitude—as God is our witness!  	Am am wa s-mahch mach pi wabsh em-hehosimhun ch pi em-iattogid machs wo haꞌichu em-wohppoꞌi. Jiosh o s-mahch mo d wohokam ihda.  
1TH02:6	We weren't trying to win anybody's praise—not from you, nor anyone else. We could have become a “burden” to you as messengers of Christ,  	Pi ach hekid am hu t-gahgid mas g oꞌodham ab wo ge has t-elidad ch ab wo t-hehgchulidad. 
1TH02:7	but instead we acted kindly among you, like a mother caring for her own children.  	Bo hi wa chum mahs mamt ab wo si has t-elidad ch haꞌichukaj wo i t-wehmtad ahchim mach d Jesus chuhchai. Kuch wabshaba pi am hu t-gahgid ihda nach pi si s-hemajim ab em-neid hab masma mat g ha-jeꞌe ab wo ha neidad g e-aꞌaliga.  
1TH02:8	We loved you so much that we were delighted to share with you not just God's good news, but also our very own selves, because you had become so dear to us. 	Si ach pihk t-elid ab em-wui ch hekaj am wabsh i t-dagitokch em-wehhejed mach em-ahgidahim g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh, chum achs hems heg hekaj wo t-koꞌij.  
1TH02:9	Don't you remember, brothers and sisters, all our hard work— working day and night so we wouldn't be a burden to any of you as we shared God's good news with you?  	Am amtp hu waꞌi s-chegito mach si chikpan wabsh i siꞌalim amjed ch mehk s-chuhugam k ed matt pi haꞌichukaj wo em-kudu. 
1TH02:10	You yourselves can testify as to how we acted, and God can too—how we treated you believers with a holy attitude, fairly and blamelessly.  	Si ach wa s-ap ab em-neid ch pi hekid hab wua g pi apꞌekam ab hema i em-wui. Jiosh o s-mahch ihda. Kum ahpim hab waꞌap s-mahch.  
1TH02:11-12	You know how we cared for every one of you like a father caring for his own children. We encouraged you, comforted you, and shared with you our experience  so that you could live as God would want you to live—the God who calls you to his own kingdom and glory. 	Jiosh o ab i em-waid mamt am wo apꞌedagk kihdaj ed ch ab wehmaj wo uꞌukchid g ab has elidadag. Kum s-mahch mach am i em-gewkemhun wepo masma mo g ha-ohg ch ab s-ap i em-neneokid ch i em-chehani mamt am hab wo masmak mam d Jiosh aꞌaliga. 
1TH02:13	Another thing: we're always thanking God that when you heard and accepted the word of God, you didn't treat it as some human words, but what it truly is, the word of God. This is what is at work in those of you who trust in him.  	Heg ach waꞌi ahgachug Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch pi g hemajkam haꞌichu ha-ahga. Kumt hab waꞌi masma hab elid k hekaj ab i s-wohoch. Jiosh o am i chikpan em-shahgid ch am wohokamchud mo d haꞌichu ahgaj. Kuch hekaj chum hekid ab si hoꞌigeꞌelid.  
1TH02:14	The experience you brothers and sisters have had imitates that of God's churches that belong to Christ Jesus in Judaea. Just like your fellow Jewish Christians you suffered as they did at the hands of the Jewish leaders  	Am am ha oidch hab e wua hegam e-wehm wohochuddam mo am aꞌai kih Judea ch ed. Ha-wehm oꞌodham o ha shoꞌigchud. K hegam wabsh s-ap ab nakog. Kum ahpim hab waꞌap wabsh s-ap ab nakog mo g em-wehm oꞌodham em-shoꞌigchud.  
1TH02:15	who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and chased us out. They don't please God and they are hostile to everyone,  	Do hegam ni-wehm oꞌodham mat wa mua g t-kownalig Jesus. Kush d t-shohshon mat wa ha kokda g Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam. K hegam ni-wehm oꞌodham t-shoꞌigchud ch gm hu i t-wuwhas ahchim mach am ahgachug g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh. K g Jiosh pi hohhoꞌid mo has e wua. Chum o hems ab wehs ha wui gegok g hemajkam  
1TH02:16	trying to prevent us from speaking to the other nations to prevent them from being saved. They're always sinning to the maximum extent, but for them full judgment has arrived! 	chum t-shohbidch ahchim mach ha ahgid g goꞌol hemajkam hegai mat hekaj wo e doꞌibia. T id ab wabsh baꞌich i geꞌedaj g pi ap ha-chuꞌijig. Kut heg gam hu ai mat ab ha wui wo jiwia g wehs s-koꞌok ha-namkidadag. 
1TH02:17	Brothers and sisters, since we felt as if we'd experienced a family separation because we hadn't seen you for a while (separated physically though not in spirit), we tried even harder to come and see you again face to face because that's what we wanted to do.  	Pi att shaꞌi pi em-chegito matt hekid am i t-gawulkai ab em-amjed. Chum ach s-em neidamk  
1TH02:18	We really wanted to come and visit you, and I, Paul, tried again and again—but Satan stopped us.  	ch am ha hekaj chum si i t-nako matt am uhpam wo hihi em-wui. Ahni Paul ant muꞌikko am chum uhpam s-himim. T am ni-kuh g jijawul ha-geꞌejig Satan.  
1TH02:19-20	For what gives us hope, what makes us happy, what we are really proud of as we stand before our Lord Jesus Christ when he comes back—is having you there too!  You are our pride and joy! 	M eda d ahpim mach am si em-hiwig ch em-hekaj wo si s-hehgigk ch ab wo si hoꞌigeꞌel g t-kownalig Jesus mat hekid ep wo jiwia. 
1TH03:1-2	So when we couldn't bear it any longer, we decided it would be best for us to stay behind in Athens,  and send Timothy on to you. He is our brother and God's co-worker in spreading the good news of Christ. We sent him to strengthen and encourage you in your trust in God  	Am att i pi t-nako am em-chegitokch. Kum s-mahch matt am i kei g t-wehnag Timothy mat am wo him k am wo em-nei. Tt ahchim am hejel wih Athens kihhim t am. Timothy o si s-ap ahgachug g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh ab amjed g Christ. Kutt hab i t-ah mat am wo him k am wo i em-gewkemhun k am wo i gewkai g em-wohochudadag.  
1TH03:3	so that none of you would be upset by your troubles—for you know we should expect such things.  	Kumt hab pi hedai wo shaꞌi dagito g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga heg hekaj e-shoꞌigchudadag. Am am wa s-mahch matt wo t-shoꞌigch id hekaj t-wohochudadag.  
1TH03:4	Even while we were with you we kept on warning you that we would suffer persecution soon— and as you well know that is exactly what has happened.  	Id ach wa heki hu am em-ahgid mach eda am em-wehmajkahim. Kum s-mahch mat wa woho hab e juh.  
1TH03:5	This is why, when I couldn't stand it anymore, I sent to find out whether you were still trusting in God. I was concerned that the Devil  had successfully tempted you and that all our work had been for nothing! 	Kunid s-gihug mat am hu wo i em-bijim g ge Jiawul. Kut wo heki e wua g t-chikpan am em-shahgid. Nt pi ni-nako manis am baꞌich ep wo i neahi k hekaj am i kei g Timothy mat wo s-mai mams am wabsh kia ab s-wohochud. 
1TH03:6	Now Timothy has just returned from visiting you and he has brought us good news of your trust in God and the love you have. He's told us that you still have fond memories of us, longing to see us just as we long to see you.  	T hemuch ia ep jiwia ab em-amjed k ia uꞌapa g s-ta hohhoꞌidam ahga ab amjed g em-wohochudadag ch pihk em-elidadag. Am o t-ahgid mam chum hekid si s-ap am t-chegito ch hab wa masma chum s-t-neidamk mach ahchim has i masma chum s-em-neidamk.  
1TH03:7	This news really encouraged us while we were suffering troubles ourselves, brothers and sisters, knowing that you continue to hold on to your trust in God.  	Muꞌi ach haꞌichu nakog ch muꞌi t-shoꞌigchud. K wabshaba g em-wohochudadag ab t-gewkemhun.  
1TH03:8	For us life is worth living now because you're standing firm in the Lord!  	S-gegokim amki ab s-wohochud g t-kownalig Jesus. Kuch ab si t-nenenashanichud  
1TH03:9	As we go into the presence of our God, how can we ever thank God enough for you because of all the joy you bring to us?  	ch ab si i hoꞌigeꞌelid g Jiosh mam hab wa masma ab t-mahkch g s-hehgig.  
1TH03:10	Night and day we pray with all our hearts, hoping to see you again face to face, and to help you continue developing your trust in God.  	Chum ach hekid ab tahni g Jiosh wehs t-ihbdagkaj matt wo wa ep em-neid k ab wo i em-wehmt mamt s-ap ab wo s-wohochudad g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.  
1TH03:11	May God our Father and our Lord Jesus make it possible for us to come to see you soon.  	Mat hems wo waꞌi t-hiwigi g t-ohg Jiosh ch t-kownalig Jesus matt am wo wa ep em-nei. 
1TH03:12	May the Lord increase your love so it overflows to one another, and to everyone, just as we love you.  	Ab ach tahni g Jiosh mat baꞌich ab wo i em-mah g gewkdag mamt hekaj wo si pihk e elidad ab aꞌai e wui ch ab ha wui g wehs hemajkam.  
1TH03:13	In this way may the Lord strengthen you so you may stand with minds that are holy and blameless before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his holy ones.

1TH04:1	A few more things: Brothers and sisters, we plead with you and urge you in the Lord Jesus to behave in ways that please God, just as we instructed you. Of course you're already doing this, just do it more and more!  	Pegih, t-wepnag, am ach wa em-ahgid mamt has masma wo himad g e-doakag ch hab wo hohhoꞌidach g Jiosh. Ab amt bei g haꞌichu t-ahga. Kuch hemuch ab si em-tahni ch ab em-chehani am wehhejed g t-kownalig Jesus mamt baꞌich am hab wo i junihid.  
1TH04:2	You remember the instructions we gave you on behalf of the Lord Jesus.  	S-mahch am mach wa has masma am em-shelinid g gewkdajkaj. 
1TH04:3	What God wants is for you to live holy lives. So stay away from sexual immorality  	Jiosh o em-tatchuid mamt ab wo si i e gawulkai pi apꞌekam amjed k wo si e nuhkud g hejel e-wehm kihkam wehhejed.  
1TH04:4	in order that each of you may control yourselves  in a way that is holy and respectful,  	Ahpim chechoj amt wo s-mahchk mamt wo si s-ap ha hohnt am tahgio g Jiosh ch am hemajkam ha tahgio.  
1TH04:5	not indulging passionate lust like the heathen who have no knowledge of God.  	Hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh o wabsh hejel e-tatchui wehhejed bebhe g uwi. Mt wabshaba ahpim pi hab masma wo be  
1TH04:6	Don't cheat or take advantage of another Christian in these matters, for the Lord is the one who executes justice in all such things, as we've already clearly explained to you, and warned you about.  	k hab pi ab hu hedai wui pi ap has wo chuꞌi. Heki ach hu am em-ahgid mat g Jiosh s-koꞌokam wo ha namkid matp hedai am hab wo juh ihda pi apꞌekam.  
1TH04:7	For God did not call us to live impure lives, but holy lives.  	Jiosh at pi hab ahgk ab i t-gawulkai machs am hab wo junihid g s-uam haꞌichu. Do tatchuij matt d wo hekia s-apꞌekamk.  
1TH04:8	So anyone who rejects this position isn't just rejecting what a human being is saying; they are rejecting God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you. 	K heg hekaj ab t-mahkch g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag. Hegai matp hedai wo s-ohhod ihda mashchama at wo s-ohhod g Jiosh. 
1TH04:9	We certainly don't need to write and tell you to love fellow believers, because God teaches you to love one another—  	Heki atsh hu i em-tashogi g Jiosh mamt wo si pihk e elidad wehs ha hekaj g e-wehm wohochuddam. K pi hab chum mahs machs am hu ep wo ge em-oꞌohani ab amjed.  
1TH04:10	and in fact you are demonstrating this love to all the believers throughout Macedonia. Even so we want to encourage you, brothers and sisters, to love more and more.  	Si amsh pihk e elid wehs ha hekaj g e-wehm wohochuddam am wehs Macedonia jewed ch ed. Kuch wabshaba ab si em-tahni mamt baꞌich am hab wo i e junihid.  
1TH04:11	Try to live a quiet life, minding your own business, doing your own work, as we've already explained to you,  	Am g wo i e nakog mamt wo s-dodolimak ch am hab wo junihid g hejel e-chikpan ch wo haꞌichu e gahgidad. Id ach wa heki hu hab em-ahgid.  
1TH04:12	so that your way of life may be respected by non-Christians and you won't have to rely on anyone to provide what you need. 	Bamt masma pi hedai ab hu wo hiwgad mas ab wabsh wo em-mah hegai mam haschu i tatchua. T hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh wo em-nei mam s-chikpnadag k ab wo si has em-elidad. 
1TH04:13	We don't want you to be confused about what happens when people die,  brothers and sisters, so that you won't grieve like others who don't have any hope.  	Si ach em-tatchuid mamt wo s-mahchk g wohokam ab ha amjed hegam mat heki hu koi. T hahawa pi wo i em-bijim g pi ap tahhadkam hab masma mat hab wo ha juh g pi wohochuddam.  
1TH04:14	Since we're convinced that Jesus died and rose again, we're also sure that God will bring with Jesus those who have died trusting in him.  	Neh, ab at i wuhsh g Jesus muhkig amjed. Kuch s-wohochud ihda ch hekaj ab wui nenea mat g Jiosh ab ep wo i ha wuwhas hegam mat koi ab s-wohochudch g haꞌichu ahgaj ab amjed g Jesus. 
1TH04:15	What we're telling you comes from the Lord: those of us who are alive and still here when the Lord comes certainly won't precede those who have died.  	Hegam atsh wo i wuwha ab amjed g muhkig matt koi an hu wo nam g t-kownalig Jesus.  
1TH04:16	For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout, with the cry of the archangel, and with the sound of God's trumpet, and those who have died in Christ will rise first.  	Wehpeg at ab wo si s-kaidam t-wai g anghil ha-geꞌejig. T g Jiosh kuikud ab haha wo kaida. T ab haha wo i hud g t-kownalig Jesus ab dahm kahchim t amjed. T hegam mat heki hu koi ab s-wohochudch g Jesus ab wo i wuwha.  
1TH04:17	Then those of us who are alive and still here will be carried up together with them into the clouds, and we shall meet the Lord in the air. Then we will be with the Lord forever!  	T hegam mat hedai in d wo kia dodakamk heg i tash ed ab haha wo i e hemapai ha wehm chewagi ch ed k an wo nam g t-kownalig. Kutt am i amjed chum hekid wo wehmajk g t-kownalig.  
1TH04:18	So encourage one another with these words. 	Ab g wo si e gewkemhunad id hekaj haꞌichu ahga. 
1TH05:1	Brothers and sisters, we don't need to write anything to you about prophetic times and dates.  	Pi o hab mahs manis am hu wo em-oꞌohani ab amjed mas hekid hab wo i e juh ihda haꞌichu mani am ahg.  
1TH05:2	You yourselves know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.  	Am am wa s-ap s-mahch mat chum s-aꞌagi wo e ai mat ep wo jiwia g t-kownalig Jesus. Neh, pi o ta machima mas hekid wo i jiwia g s-chu ehskam chuhug ch ed, o mas hekid wo i e ai mat g uwi ab wo taht g s-koꞌok k wo bei g ali. K hab waꞌap pi ta machima am ha wehhejed g pi e doꞌibiakam mas hekid ep wo jiwia g t-kownalig.  
1TH05:3	When people talk about peace and security suddenly they will be completely ruined. It will be just like the sudden onset of childbirth, and they certainly won't escape.  	Idam at hab wo kaijjid mo wehs haꞌichu am wabsh i si s-apꞌe ch s-dodolima. T am wabsh wo si e ai mat wo e koꞌijid k pi wo e doꞌibia. 
1TH05:4	But you, brothers and sisters, are not in the dark about this so that you won't be caught by surprise when the Day of Judgment  arrives suddenly like a thief.  	Kum eda ahpim e doꞌibiakam s-mahch ihda. K pi hab chum mahs mat s-aꞌagi wo jiwia hegai tash em-wui hab sha masma mo g s-chu ehskam.  
1TH05:5	For you are all children of light and children of the day. We don't belong to the night or to darkness.  	Jiosh o haꞌichu t-tashogid. Kuch an uꞌukch g tonlig hab masma mo hegam mo am tash ed hihim.  
1TH05:6	So then we shouldn't be sleeping like everybody else—we should stay awake and keep ourselves clear-headed.  	Pegih, tt wo chum s-nenenashanik ch pi hab wo masmak mo g nawkkoi.  
1TH05:7	For it's during the night that people sleep; and it's at night that they get drunk.  	Hegam mo pi nenenashanik ch nawkkoꞌo o am eda g s-chuhugam.  
1TH05:8	But since we belong to the day we should keep our heads clear, strapping on the breastplate of trust and love, and putting on as a helmet the hope of salvation.  	Kutt wabshaba ahchim s-ap wo t-nahtokchid hab masma mo g shondal. T-wohochudadag ch pihk t-elidadag o d wainomi lihwa t-wehhejed. Kuch ab wui t-gewpkadch mat g t-doꞌibiadag s-ap wo e nahto. K id hab sha masma mo g wainomi wonami t-wehhejed.  
1TH05:9	For God hasn't placed us in a position to be punished, but has reserved us for salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ.  	Pi at hab ahgk ab i t-gawulkai g Jiosh mas wo t-namkid heg hekaj pi ap t-chuꞌijig k wabshaba hab ahgk mat g t-kownalig Jesus Christ wo t-doꞌibia.  
1TH05:10	He's the one who died for us so that whether we're alive or dead we shall live together with him.  	Heg at muh t-wehhejed k i wuhsh matt d wo dodakamk wehmaj. K wabsh chum has masma s-apꞌe chum achs wo heki hu koi o in d wabsh wo kia dodakamk mat wo jiwia.  
1TH05:11	So encourage and strengthen one another, just as you are doing. 	Mt heg hekaj ab wabsh wo si aꞌai e gewkemhunad ch ab aꞌai haꞌichukaj wo i e wehmajk mam am hab wa e junihim. 
1TH05:12	Brothers and sisters, we're asking you to respect those who work with you, who lead you in the Lord and teach you.  	Ab ach si em-tahni mamt s-ap ab wo ha neidad g e-wanimeddam ch hegam mo am em-mashcham ch ab shohbidch g pi apꞌekam em-shahgid. Do Jiosh hab elida mo hab wua.

1TH05:14	We urge you, brothers and sisters, to warn those who are lazy, encourage those who are anxious, help those who are weak, and be patient with everyone.

1TH05:22	keep away from every kind of evil. 	Im g hu wehs hab wo i juhni g pi apꞌekam.

1TI01:4	They shouldn't concern themselves with legends and never-ending obsessions about ancestry. Such ideas only lead to pointless debates, instead of understanding God as we trust in him.

1TI01:6	Some have deviated from these things, and have ended up talking nonsense.  	Haꞌi at dagito g e-wohochudadag k hekaj wabsh ha wehm e neꞌowin.  
1TI01:7	They have ambitions to be teachers of the law, but they have no idea what they're talking about or what they're so boldly announcing! 	Idam o hab chum e elid mo d chehanig ha mashchamdam ch wabshaba pi amichud g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga chum as hab e elid mo s-e mahchk ch neneok. 
1TI01:8-9	Now we recognize that the law is good if people use it properly.  We also know that law isn't laid down for those who do what is right, but for those who are rebellious and ignore the law. It applies to people who have no use for God, who are sinful, who treat nothing as holy and are completely irreligious. It's for those who kill fathers and mothers, for murderers,  	S-apꞌe o g chehanig. K wabshaba idam pi ap hekaj am chum ha shohbidch hegam mo hab wua g s-apꞌekam.

1TI01:15-16	You can trust this saying that everyone should accept: “Christ Jesus came to this world to save sinners,” and I'm the worst of them.  For this reason I was shown mercy—since I'm the worst sinner, Jesus Christ could demonstrate his infinite patience as an example to those who choose to trust in him and gain eternal life. 	Neh, hema hab cheꞌidag o hab chuꞌig, “Ia at jiwia g t-kownalig Jesus jewed dahm mat wo ha doꞌibia g pi ap chuꞌijkam.” K id d si wohokam nat pi ab si s-ni-hoꞌigeꞌel.

Kut heg hekaj am i ni-kei mant wo i ahgahi ab amjed g alidaj k wo ha mashcha g gawul mahs hemajkam g wohokam. S-mahch ap wehs ihda.

1TI02:9	In the same way, women should dress sensibly, modestly, and appropriately. They should be attractive not in their hairstyle or by wearing gold or pearls or expensive clothes,  	Kunt hab ep wo chei mat g uꞌuwi wabsh s-ap ab wo e enigadadch ch ep s-ap hab wo juhkchid g e-moꞌo mat pi heg hekaj wo chum si e hahaschudad.

1TI02:11	Women should learn quietly, respecting their place.  	Ab o d ep ha-wuikam mat wabsh s-bahbagi ch s-dodolim ab wo kaiham k wo mahchid g Jiosh himdag. 
1TI02:12	I don't allow women to be instructors, or to dominate men; let them remain quiet.  	Ahni ani pi shaꞌi ha hiwgid g uꞌuwi mas wo ha mashcha g chechoj o am ha dahm wo e uhꞌulinchid.

1TI02:15	However women will be saved through becoming mothers, as long as they continue to trust and love, and to live holy, sensible lives.

1TI03:8	Similarly deacons  should be respected, and not hypocritical. They should not be addicted to drink, and should not be trying to dishonestly enrich themselves.  	T hab waꞌap s-ap d wo oꞌOdhamk hegam mo am i ha wehmaj g ha wanimeddam. Pt wo ha ahgi mat pi wo chu iattomk ch pi wo nawkkoꞌod ch pi heg waꞌi lial ab wo tatchuad.

1TI03:11	Their wives should be respected too. They should not slander people with gossip, and they should be self-controlled and trustworthy in all they do.  	Uꞌuwi chikpandam at hab waꞌap s-ap d wo uꞌuwik ch pi wo chu ahgamk ch pi wo nawkkoꞌod ch pi wo chu iattomk.

1TI03:14-15	Even though I hope to see you soon, I'm writing about all this to you so that  if I'm delayed you'll know how people should behave themselves in God's house. This is the church of the living God, the support pillar and foundation of the truth.  	Bani chum ni-tahtk mant s-hohtam am wo i m-chehgim. Tp wabshaba hems pi wo ni-apꞌet.

1TI03:16	There's no question about it: the revealed truth about God is amazing! He was made known to us in human form, he was vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, declared to the nations, trusted in by the world, and taken up in glory! 	Pi o wa ta machima matt has masma wo s-apꞌekamk am Jiosh tahgio. T wabshaba id am i t-tashogi g Jiosh. K d wohokam ihda mo an hab chuꞌig neꞌi ed:

1TI04:5	since it is made sacred by the word of God and by prayer. 	Bo kaij g Jiosh mat g hoꞌigeꞌidahuna am wo i apꞌech nenaj ed. 
1TI04:6	If you point out these things to the brothers and sisters you will be a good minister  of Christ Jesus. You gain strength by trusting in the truth, and in the good teaching you've followed.

1TI04:10	The reason we work and do the best we can is because our hope is in the living God. He is the Savior of all people, especially of those who trust in him.

1TI04:11	This is what you should teach. Tell everyone to follow your instructions.  	Am g i ha mashcham ihda mani m-ahgid k ab i ha chehani mat am hab wo junihid.  
1TI04:12	Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young. Be an example to those who trust in God—in the way you speak, the kind of life you live, in love, in trust, and in purity.  	Bapt masma s-ap hab wo e junihid ch s-ap wo neokad. T pi hedai pad has wo m-elidad map d wabsh wechij hemajkam.

1TI04:14	Don't neglect the gracious gift you have that was given to you by prophetic inspiration when the church elders laid their hands on you.

1TI04:15	Think carefully about these things, and dedicate yourself completely to them so that everyone can see the progress you're making.  	T hab ab wo i e gewkemhunad g wohochuddam an m-neidch.  
1TI04:16	Mind what you're doing and what you're teaching. Keep going with all of this, because as you do so you'll save both yourself and those who listen to you.

1TI05:1	Don't rebuke a man who is older than you. Instead, encourage him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as brothers,  	Pi g ab wabsh si chehmod g keli oꞌodham k wabshaba ab wabsh wo s-ap haꞌichu kakke hab masma mapt g hejel e-ohg hab chum masma hab wo juhkchid.

1TI05:3	Help widows who don't have a family.  	Am g ha ahgid hegam mo am hemiap e mihshmad mat wo ha nuhkud hegam mo d si heheꞌejel wiꞌikam uꞌuwi.  
1TI05:4	For the Christian responsibility of a widow's children or grandchildren is to do their duty for their own family, and repay their parents by helping them out. This is what pleases God.  	K wabshaba pi ab hu ha ab mas wo ha nuhkud hegam mo ge aꞌaliga. Idam ha-aꞌaliga at wo chum ha nuhkud nat pi ha geꞌegel. K d Jiosh tatchui mat aigo epai wo i ha wehmtad,  
1TI05:5	Now a real widow, having no family, alone and without support, puts her hope in God and prays for help night and day.  	Hegam mo woho d si heheꞌejel wihpkam o heg ab waꞌi hiwig Jiosh ch chum hekid ab tahni g i wehmtadag. Idam amt wo ha nuhkudad  
1TI05:6	But a widow who concentrates on pleasing herself is already dead, even though she's still physically alive.  	ch wabshaba wabsh wo ha dagito hegam mo wabsh e gahgid g s-tahhadkam.  
1TI05:7	Give people these instructions so that they will be above criticism.  	Neh, pt wo ha ahgi hegam mo e wehm mihshmad mat hab wo juh ihda mani m-ahgid. T hab pi hedai has wo ha ahgad.  
1TI05:8	But those who don't look after their relatives, especially their own family, have denied their beliefs, and are worse than those who don't believe.  	Hegam mat pi wo ha nuhkud g e-hajuni o baꞌich d i pi apꞌekam mo g mischini. 
1TI05:9	Only widows over sixty who have been faithful to their husbands should be put on the list. 	Pi at an hu wo ha ui g wechij uꞌuwi mat wo ha nuhkud. Hegam mat wo i ha wehmtad at wo aisk g chuhdpo wehst-mahm aꞌahidag ch d wo hegamk mo s-ap e nuhkudahim g e-kunbad wehhejed  
1TI05:10	The widow should have a reputation for doing good. Did she bring up children properly? Has she been hospitable? Has she washed the feet of church members? Has she helped those who were in trouble? Has she really tried to do good in every way? 	ch s-ap ha geꞌegel g aꞌal ch s-ap ha nuhkud g Jiosh wohochuddam ch wehsko s-e mahch mo haꞌichukaj i ha wehmt hegam mo tatchua g i wehmtadag, chum as hems pi d wo ha-machigak. 
1TI05:11-12	Don't take on widows who are younger, because when their physical desires make them want to re-marry they abandon their dedication to Christ.  In this they are guilty of breaking their previous commitment. 	Wechij uꞌuwi atp hems ep wo s-kuhkuntam mo eda hab chum kaij mat pi hab wo e juh k wabsh wo chikpani g Jiosh, neh, k hab masma wo e chuꞌijigchud k gam hu hab wo i e juh ab amjed g Christ.  
1TI05:13	They also get used to a lazy life, just visiting each other in their homes. Not only lazy, but they gossip and meddle, talking about things they shouldn't.  	Haꞌi atp hems wabsh wo s-e papadmakamch an oiopodch ha-kihki oidch, wahm baꞌich i pi apꞌe mat wo mai g has ahgadag k an wo gantanad g pi kehg haꞌichu ahga.  
1TI05:14-15	So my best advice is that younger widows marry and have children and take care of the home. That way there's no opportunity for criticism from the Enemy.  However some have already gone the way of Satan.  	Haꞌi at heki hu hab masma hab e juh k am i oi g Jiawul.

1TI05:16	Any Christian woman who has widows in the family should help them, so that the church is not burdened with the responsibility, and can help those widows who are truly in need.

1TI05:17	Elders who direct the church well should be seen as doubly valuable,  particularly those who work in speaking the Word and in teaching.

1TI05:18	As Scripture says, “You must not muzzle the ox when it is threshing the corn.” Also, “The worker deserves to be paid.” 	An o oꞌohanas Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana ed: 
1TI05:19	Don't entertain any accusation against an elder unless two or three witnesses support it.  	Pi g ab hu kaiham g haꞌichu abchuda ab hema i ha ab idam kekel, heg hi wa mat gohk o waik hab wo chei mo si s‑ap s‑mahch haꞌichu ab ha amjed, mt am haha wo i mamche.

1TI05:21	Before God and Christ Jesus, and the holy angels, I instruct you to follow these instructions without bias. Don't do anything from an attitude of favoritism.

1TI05:23-25	Don't just drink water, but use a little bit of wine because of your bad stomach—you're sick so often! The sins of some people are really obvious, and they are clearly guilty, but the sins of others are not seen until later.  Similarly some good works are obvious, and even those that are hidden won't be for long. 	Haꞌi o g pi ap ha‑chuꞌijig am tasho e neid. Kum s‑ap s‑mahch ch pi woho am hu wo i ha chuhcha idam.

1TI06:1	All who are bound under slavery should consider their masters worthy of respect, so that God's name and Christian beliefs won't be defamed.  	Hegam wohochuddam mo d nenehol at ab wo si has ha elidad g e‑aꞌamo. T heg hekaj pi hedai wo has ahgad g Jiosh ch pi wo has ahgad g t‑mashchama.  
1TI06:2	Slaves who have Christian masters should not disrespect them because they are brothers. Instead they should serve them even better, because those who are benefiting from their service are fellow-believers they should love. Teach these instructions, and encourage people to follow them. 	Hegam mo g ha‑aꞌamo hab waꞌap d wohochuddam at baꞌich ab wo i si has ha elidad ch baꞌich i s‑ap wo ha chikpani nat pi g ha‑chikpan d wo ha‑apꞌedagk g ha‑wehm wohochuddam. 
1TI06:3-4	Those that teach different beliefs, and don't listen to good counsel, particularly the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the true teachings of God,  are arrogant and don't understand anything. They're obsessed with speculation and philosophical debates which only lead to jealousy, arguments, malicious gossip and evil suspicions—  	Ho o wabsh chum si e hahaschud ch d wabsh pi haꞌichu mahchim hegam mat hedai i pi heg hekaj wo ha mashcha t‑kownalig Jesus Christ mashchama.

1TI06:8	But if we have food and clothes then that's enough for us.  	Heg o am wa chum s‑apꞌe am t‑wehhejed matt ab wo wa al heꞌes haꞌichu koꞌad ch ab s‑ap wo t‑enigadadch.  
1TI06:9	Those who are determined to become rich fall into the trap of temptation, following many foolish and damaging impulses.  	Hegam mo s‑e kaischudamk at heg hekaj hab wo s‑junim g pi apꞌekam. T g ha‑tatchui gam hu hab wo i ha juh ab amjed g Jiosh. Kut haꞌi ep wo ha padch.  
1TI06:10	For the desire to be rich leads to many kinds of evil results. Some of those who longed for this have turned away from the truth, and have hurt themselves, experiencing a lot of pain. 	Nahnko mahs pi apꞌekam o ab shohshon heg amjed mat hema heg waꞌi lialkaj wo si pihk e elidad. Haꞌi at heg hekaj im hu hab i e juh ab amjed g e‑wohochudadag k oi wa muꞌi haꞌichu pi ap tahhadkam ab nako. 
1TI06:11	But you as a man of God should run away from such things. You should seek to do what is right, practice true religion, and trust in God. Aim to love, to be patient, and gentle.  	Pi g hab masma hab e juhni mo hegam mani am ha ahg nap pi d Jiosh chikpandamga. Id apt eda am wo i e nako s‑apꞌekam ch e‑wohochudadag ch pihk elidadag ch haꞌichu nakogadag ch hemajimatalig mapt wo wepo chuꞌigk mo g Jiosh.  
1TI06:12	Fight the good fight as you trust in God. Hold on tightly to the eternal life to which you were called. This is what you promised to do in front of many witnesses. 	Am g si e gewkad wehhejed g Jiosh k wo s‑wihnam uꞌukchid g e‑wohochudadag mapt hekaj am wo i wah Jiosh kihdag ed hab masma mat g s‑melidkam hab wo e juh mat wo ha gehg. 
1TI06:13-14	My charge to you before God the Life-giver, and before Christ Jesus who testified to the good news before Pontius Pilate,  is to follow faithfully what you've been told so you will be above criticism until our Lord Jesus Christ appears.  	Bapt wabsh masma hab wo e juh matsh wa g t‑kownalig Jesus natsh pi heg s‑ap ah g wohokam am tahgio hegai geꞌe kownal mo hab chehgig Pontius Pilate.

Neh, bo masma. 
1TI06:17	Warn those who are rich in the present world not to become proud. Tell them not to place their trust in wealth that is so insecure but in God who so freely gives us everything for our enjoyment.  	Ab g i ha chehani hegam mo d s‑kakais mat pi wo si e hahaschudad heg hekaj haꞌichu e‑eniga ch pi ab hu wo hiwgad ch wabshaba ab wo hiwgad g Jiosh.

1TI06:21	Some who promote these ideas have wandered away from their trust in God. May grace be with you.	Haꞌi o hab chum e ahg mo edgid ihda mahchig ch oi wa wabsh heb hu wua g e‑wohochudadag. 
2CO01:2	May you have grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. 	Ab o wa si s-em-hoꞌigeꞌid g t-ohg Jiosh g t-kownalig Jesus Christ wehm ch ab wo wa baꞌich i em-mahkad g i wehmtadag ch s-ap tahhadkam. 
2CO01:3	Praise be to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! He is the compassionate Father and the God of all comfort.  	T-kownalig Jesus Christ ohg o hab waꞌap d t-ohg Jiosh ch si s-hemajima ab t-wui. Wehs g i gewkemhunadag o ab amjed him. Kutt heg hekaj ab wo si i hoꞌigeꞌidad.

Kuch heg hekaj t-nakog matt am epai wo i ha gewkemhunad hegam mo nahnko mahs haꞌichukaj e kudut heg wa hekaj mat haschu g Jiosh hekaj i t-gewkemhu.  
2CO01:5	The more we share in Christ's sufferings, the more we receive the abundant comfort of Christ.  	M o wa woho mach hebai t-shoꞌigchud mach d Jesus Christ wohochuddam. K wabshaba g Jiosh baꞌich i t-gewkemhun heg hekaj mat haschu g Jesus Christ am hab t-juni.  
2CO01:6	If we are in distress, it is for your comfort and salvation. If we are being comforted, it is for your comfort, which results in you patiently bearing the same sufferings that we suffer.  	Ahchim ach wa t-shoꞌigchud am i em-wehmajch mamt wo e doꞌibia. K g Jiosh am i t-gewkemhun matt hab waꞌap am wo i em-gewkemhu. Mt hab ab wo bei g gewkdag mamt s-ap wo nako hegai hab mahs shoꞌigdag mach ahchim nakog.  
2CO01:7	We have great confidence in you, knowing that as you share in our sufferings you also share in our comfort. 	Pegih, s-mahch ach mamt hemho wa hab waꞌap wo bei g i gewkemhunadag nam pi hab waꞌap nakog g shoꞌigchudadag. 
2CO01:8	Brothers and sisters, we won't keep you in the dark about the trouble we had in Asia. We were so overwhelmed that we were afraid we wouldn't have the strength to continue—so much so we doubted we would live through it.  	Tatchua ach matt am wo i em-chegitoich ahpim t-wepnag matt heꞌekia i t-shoꞌigch am Asia jewed ch ed. Shaꞌat waꞌi si s-wechima ab t-maꞌish hegai cheggiadag. Kunt wa shaꞌi si s-mukima ni-taht.  
2CO01:9	In fact it was like a death sentence inside us. This was to stop us relying on ourselves and to trust in God who raises the dead.  	Bo wa sha tahhadag mant ni-lodaitachud k hemho wa wo ni-muꞌij. Id atki hab ahgk hab e juh matt pi ab hu hejel wo t-hiwgad ch wabshaba heg waꞌi Jiosh ab wo si hiwgad. Heg o ab i ha wuwhasid g koꞌi muhkig amjed  
2CO01:10	He saved us from a terrible death, and he will do so again. We have total confidence in God that he will continue to save us.  	ch t-doꞌibia ab amjed hegai si s-ta ehbidamakam haꞌichu matt am chum t-koꞌij. Kuch ab si hiwig mat ep wo t-doꞌibia matt pi wo t-koꞌij.  
2CO01:11	You help us by praying for us. In this way many will thank God for us because of the blessing that God will give us in response to the prayers of many. 	Kum ahpim am i t-wehmaj am e hoꞌigeꞌidahunch t-wehhejed. T g Jiosh am hab wo juh mam haschu ab tahni k ab wo s-t-hoꞌigeꞌel. T muꞌi ab wo hoꞌigeꞌel g Jiosh t-hekaj. 
2CO01:12	We take pride in the fact—and our conscience confirms it—that we have acted properly towards people, and especially to you. We have followed God's principles of holiness and sincerity, not according to worldly wisdom but through the grace of God.  	Jiosh o si s-hemajim ab t-mahkch g gewkdag.

2CO01:13	For we are not writing anything complicated that you can't read and understand. I hope you'll understand in the end,  	Heg ach am waꞌi em-oꞌohanid mamt haschu s-ap wo neꞌokchulid k wo s-amich. Am ani hab hi wa chum em-elid mamt am hu wa hebai wehs s-ap wo s-amich

2CO01:15-16	Because I was so sure of your confidence in me I planned to come and visit you first. That way you could have benefited twice,  as I would go on from you to Macedonia, and then return from Macedonia to you. Then I would have had you send me on my way to Judea.  	D ant huꞌi heki hu hab masma i chum apꞌech mant am wo i em-nei am himadch Macedonia wui k am ep wo i em-nei ab uhpam himadch. Mt hab gokko ab wo bei g hoꞌigeꞌidadag k wo i ni-wehmt mant am wo hih Judea wui.  
2CO01:17	Why did I change my original plan? Do you think I make my decisions lightly? Do you think that when I plan I'm like some worldly person who says Yes and No at the same time?  	Nt eda pi koi am hu i em-chehgim. Kumki haꞌi hab ni-elid mani wabsh pehegi neok ch pi woho am hu hab wo ni-juh mani wa has i kaij.  
2CO01:18	Just as God can be trusted, when we give you our word it's not both Yes and No.  	K eda pi woho ihda. Jiosh o s-mahch mani hab chum s-junimk mani haschu hab i ahg mant hab wo juh.  
2CO01:19	The truth of the Son of God, Jesus Christ, was announced to you by us—me, Silvanus, and Timothy—and it wasn't both Yes and No. In Christ the answer is absolutely Yes!  	Neh, am ach ahgachug g Silas ch Timothy wehm ab amjed g Jesus Christ. K heg d Jiosh alidag ch chum hekid hab wua mo haschu hab i ahg.  
2CO01:20	However many promises God has made, in Christ the answer is always Yes. Through him we respond, saying Yes to the glory of God.  	Wehs at am hab t-juni g Jiosh g hab e-elida am gahi wuhshanim g Jesus Christ. Kutt heg gahi wuhshanim ab wo si hehgchulidad g Jiosh.  
2CO01:21-22	God has given both us and you the inner strength to stand firm in Christ. God has appointed us,  placed his stamp of approval on us, and given us the guarantee of the Spirit in our hearts.  	Do Jiosh mat am i t-gewpkadch Christ himdag ed ab t-mahk g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag. K heg am wohokamchud mach d hemajkamgaj ch wehs wo bei hegai mo ab t-makiog. 
2CO01:23	I call God as my witness that it was to avoid causing you pain that I chose not to come to Corinth.  	S-mahch o g Jiosh mani pi em-kudutamk ch heg hekaj pi koi am hu ep em-wui hih. Baꞌich o i s-apꞌe mamt wehpeg am wo i apꞌech hegai mo pi apꞌe am em-shahgid.  
2CO01:24	This isn't because we want to dictate how you relate to God, but because we want to help you have a joyful experience—for it's by trusting God that you stand firm. 	Pi o hab chum chuꞌig machs ahchim am wo em-nuꞌichkwuhid em-wohochudadag ed. Baꞌich o i s-apꞌe matt am wo i em-gewkemhu em-wohochudadag ed. Kumt hab wo s-gegokkad heg eda. 
2CO02:1	That's why I decided that I would avoid another sad visit with you.  	Am ant si i ni-oidahim k hab i ni-ah mantki pi am hu wo i em-chehgim hemu manis wo ge s-em-kehꞌel.  
2CO02:2	For if I make you sad, who will be there to make me happy? It won't be those I've made sad!  	Mt pi wo ap e taht mantp hab wo ni-juh. Nt ahni hab waꞌap pi wo ap ni-taht.  
2CO02:3	That's why I wrote what I did, so that I wouldn't be sad over those who should make me happy. I was so sure that all of you would share in my happiness.  	Heg ant hekaj am wabsh em-oꞌohani. Ab amt wo chum ni-mah g s-ap tahhadkam. Kuni pi tatchua manis am wo chum jiwia em-wui k wabsh pi wo ap ni-taht em-wehhejed. S-mahch ani mamt wo s-hehgigk mant hekid ahni wo s-hehgigk.  
2CO02:4	I was crying many tears when I wrote to you, in great anguish and with a heavy heart—not to make you sad, but so you would know how much love I have for you. 	Si ani pi ap ni-tahtk ch muꞌi ni-ohꞌog iawua am em-oꞌohanidk nani pi si pihk ni-elid em-hekaj. Ni eda pi tatchua manis ab wo em-mah g pi ap tahhadkam. 
2CO02:5	Not to put it too strongly, but the person caused more pain to all of you than to me.  	Ab at i em-mah g pi ap tahhadkam hegai mat am si pi ap has chuꞌi em-shahgid. Kuni pi tatchua manis ab wabsh wo si em-chehmo.  
2CO02:6	This person suffered enough punishment from the majority of you,  	Am at wa geꞌe ab nako g e-namkidadag ab em-amjed mamt has i masma am apꞌech.  
2CO02:7	so now you should forgive him and be kind to him. Otherwise he may sink into despair.  	Mt hahawa ab wo i s-hoꞌigeꞌid k ab wo i gewkemhu nat pi has e juh k am hu wo si pi ap e tahtam k wabsh si s-wohom gm hu hab wo i e juh.  
2CO02:8	So I urge you to publicly affirm your love towards him.  	Am g dahm ep wo ahgid mam ab si pihk e elid wui.  
2CO02:9	That's why I wrote: so I could discoverer your true character and whether you're doing everything you were told to do.  	S-mahchimk ani am i em-oꞌohanidk mams ab wo s-ni-wohog el. Kumt wa woho am hab e juh.  
2CO02:10	Anyone you forgive, I forgive too. What I have forgiven, whatever it may be, I have forgiven before Christ for your benefit.  	Kunt hab waꞌap ab wo i s-hoꞌigeꞌel hegai mat pi ap has chuꞌi mamtp ahpim ab wo i s-hoꞌigeꞌel.  
2CO02:11	In this way Satan will not be able to take us in, because we know the tricks he thinks up. 	T hab pi wo e nako g Jiawul mas wo t-wohppoꞌi ihda t-wehnag. S-mahch ach mo hab wa s-e junimk. 
2CO02:12	Now when I arrived in Troas to spread the good news of Christ, the Lord opened a door of opportunity for me.  	Pegih, nt wa pi am hu em-wui hih am himadch Macedonia wui k wabshaba am hih Troas wui. Tki g Jiosh am apꞌech mant am i ahgachug g haꞌichu ahgaj amai.  
2CO02:13	But my mind wasn't at peace because I couldn't find my brother Titus. So I said goodbye and went over to Macedonia. 	Nt am hu hebai ni-kudu nat pi pi oi jiwia g Titus am i em-chehgimedk. Kunt am i ha hoꞌigeꞌel g t-wehm wohochuddam amai k gam hu hih Macedonia wui. T am ni-nam g Titus k am ni-ahgid mamt s-ap am hab juh g ni-neꞌoki. 
2CO02:14	But praise be to God, who always leads us in a triumphal procession in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet scent of his knowledge wherever we go!  	Kuni heg amjed ab si ihm g Jiosh mat am i apꞌech hegai mo pi apꞌe am em-shahgid. Jiosh o chum hekid ab t-mahkch g gewitoidag hekaj hegai mat g Christ am t-wehhejed hab juh. Haꞌichu t-ahga ab amjed g Christ o an wehsko e gantan hab sha masma mat g s-ap uhwchu wehsko wo e hewagi mat hebai wo e mehi.  
2CO02:15-16	We are like a fragrance of Christ to God, rising up from among those who are being saved as well as those who are dying.  To those who are dying it is the smell of decay, while to those who are being saved it is the scent of life! But who is up to such an assignment?  	Hegam mat wo e doꞌibia o ab si s-hohhoꞌid ch kah mo g Jiosh ab ha makiog g pi ha huhugedam doakag. K hegam mat pi wo e doꞌibia pi hohhoꞌid ch kah mo am hihim pi ha huhugedam muhkig wui. Pegih, do si s-has haꞌichu chikpan ihda.  
2CO02:17	We are not like the majority who trade in the word of God for profit. Quite the opposite: we are sincere in sharing the word of God in Christ, knowing God is watching us. 	Kut pi wo e nako mat am hab wo juh hegam mo wabsh pehegichud g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch wabsh s-uꞌimk g lial.

2CO03:2-3	You are our letter, written in our hearts, that everybody reads and knows about.  You demonstrate that you are a letter from Christ, delivered by us; not written with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not written on stone slabs but on human hearts.

2CO03:6	He also gave us the ability to be ministers of a new agreement, based not on the letter of the law, but on the spirit. The letter of the law kills, but the spirit gives life.

2CO03:7	However, the old way of relating to God, written in letters carved in stone, ended in death, even though it came with God's glory—so much so that the Israelites couldn't even bear to look at Moses' face because it shone so brightly, even though the glory was fading.  	Hegai hekiukam chehanig ash an oꞌohanas hohodai t ab. Tsh g Jiosh am ha chehgi g e-gewkdag ch e-tonlig matsh wa ab ha mah ihda g Tutuligo.

2CO03:8	If that was so, shouldn't the new way of relating to God in the Spirit come with even greater glory?  	k wabshaba baꞌich am t-chehgidch g e-gewkdag mo ab t-mahkch g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag. K heg am t-eda chikpan.  
2CO03:9	If the old way that condemns us has glory, the new way that makes us right with God has so much more glory!  	Do si s-has haꞌichu hegai hekiukam chehanig mach hekaj s-mahch mo ab t-aihim g s-koꞌok t-namkidadag heg hekaj pi ap t-chuꞌijig.

2CO03:10	For the old that was once glorious has no glory at all in comparison with the incredible glory of the new.  	T wabsh pi e haꞌichuch g gewkdaj g hekiukam chehanig am t-wehhejed no pi baꞌich i s-gewkdag g Christ haꞌichu ahga.  
2CO03:11	If the old that is fading away had glory, the new that continues has so much more glory. 	Hekiukam chehanig at am i huhug. T wabshaba g Christ haꞌichu ahga pi hekid wo ha huhug. 
2CO03:12	Since we have such a confident hope, we are truly bold!  	Id ach ab ab t-gewpkadch ch hekaj am si s-t-mahch ch ahgachug.  
2CO03:13	We don't have to be like Moses, who had to put on a veil to cover his face so the Israelites wouldn't be dazzled by the glory, even though it was fading away.  	Mosesbad atsh wa ab maꞌish g e-wuhiosha matsh g wehmaj oꞌodham pi ab hu wo nei hegai tonlig mo ab ab tonod ab amjed g Jiosh gewkdag. Sh hegam pi neid mo huhughim hegai tonlig. Ch ahchim hi pi ab hu maꞌishch hegai Jiosh gewkdag mo ab t-ab e chehgidch.  
2CO03:14	In spite of that, their hearts became hard. For right up until today when the old agreement is read, the same “veil” remains. Only through Christ can it be removed.  	K eda wabsh kia e ehstokch muꞌi ha wehhejed g ni-wehm oꞌodham. K heg hekaj pi mahch mo huhughim g gewkdaj hegai hekiukam chehanig. Im at hu hab wo i e juh hegai pi ha-amichudadag mat hekid ab wo i s-wohoch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ab amjed g Christ.  
2CO03:15	Even today, whenever the books of Moses are read, a veil covers their minds.  	Chum wa hems id i tashkaj o heg wa wepo mo ab maꞌishpi g ha-amichudadag mo hekid am i neꞌokchulid hegai haꞌichu ahga mat g Mosesbad an oꞌoha.  
2CO03:16	But when they turn and accept the Lord, the veil is removed.  	Neh, ab atsh i e maꞌishpiꞌo g Mosesbad matsh hekid ab ep i miabi g Jiosh. T idam ha-amichudadag hab waꞌap wo i e maꞌishpiꞌo mat hekid ab wo i miabi g Jiosh.  
2CO03:17	Now the Lord is the Spirit, and wherever the Spirit of the Lord is, there's freedom.  	Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag o d Jiosh ch am haꞌichug t-doakag ed am i t-apꞌechudk g Jiosh wehhejed. Kuch hab t-wulꞌokch mach pi chum t-apꞌechud g chehanigkaj.  
2CO03:18	So all of us, with our faces unveiled, see and reflect the glory of the Lord as in a mirror. We are being transformed into the same mirror image, whose glory grows brighter and brighter. This is what the Lord the Spirit does. 	Pi o ab hu maꞌishpi g t-amichudadag ahchim mach ab ihm g Christ. Kuch ab wui nea ch ab chehgidch g gewkdaj ch tonligaj hab sha masma mo g neidakud. K g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag am si gawul t-junihim. Tt hekaj baꞌich wo i wepo masmak g Christ. 
2CO04:1	So then, since God in his mercy has given us this new way of relating to him, we don't give up.  	Ab o s-t-hoꞌigeꞌid g Jiosh ch ab t-chehani matt am wo ahgachugad g haꞌichu ahgaj. Heg ach hekaj pi haꞌichukaj t-shohbidch ch heg am hab wua.  
2CO04:2	But we have given up secret, shameful acts. We don't behave in deceitful ways and we don't distort the word of God. We demonstrate who we are by revealing the truth before God so everybody can decide in their own minds.  	Pi ach hab wua g s-aꞌagi haꞌichu ch pi ha iattogid ch pi am hu gawul wua g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. Jiosh o s-mahch mach am ahg g wohokam ch am i t-nakog matt wo s-apꞌek am hemajkam ha-nena ed.  
2CO04:3	Even if the good news we share is veiled, it is veiled to those who are dying.  	Ihda s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh mach ahgachug o hegam waꞌi ha wehhejed pi tasho mo pi d e doꞌibiakam.  
2CO04:4	The god of this world has blinded the minds of those who don't trust in God. They can't see the light of the good news of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. 	Jiawul o geꞌe gewkdag id dahm jewed ch daishch g ha-amichudadag. K hekaj pi amichud mo s-ha doꞌibiamk g Christ ch d si hekia s-apꞌekam ch wepo d doakam g e-ohg Jiosh. Heg o wa wepo mo g Jiosh gewkdag d si s-mahs tonlig ch ab ab tonod g alidaj. K eda idam pi neid.  
2CO04:5	We are not promoting ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord. In fact we are your servants for Jesus' sake.  	Pi ach hejel t-amjed haꞌichu ahgachug. Jesus Christ o d t-kownalig. Kuch heg amjed an ahgachug ch d wabsh em-pionag wehhejed.  
2CO04:6	For God who said, “Let light shine out of the darkness,” shone in our hearts to illuminate the knowledge of God's glory in the face of Jesus Christ.  	Jiosh atsh am wa i tonlid g s-chuhugam ged huꞌi si wehpeg. K heg ha wepo mat am epai i tonlid g t-doakag nat pi t-mahtchul g Christ. K heg am t-chehgidch g Jiosh. 
2CO04:7	But we have this treasure in clay jars, to show that this supreme power comes from God and not from ourselves. 	Dach wabsh chum hemajkam. K eda g Jiosh ab t-mahkch g e-gewkdag. T hab wo s-e mahchk mo d wa Jiosh gewkdag ch am t-eda. Kuch heg hekaj hab sha masma mo g bid hahaꞌa mat hema g lai am ha eda wo toꞌakchid g s-e-kaisdag.  
2CO04:8	We are attacked from every direction, but we are not crushed. We are at a loss as to what to do, but never in despair.  	Muꞌikko ach haꞌichukaj t-kudut. K wabshaba pi haꞌichu t-shohbidch. Hebai ach haꞌichu pi aꞌamichud ch wabshaba am wabsh baꞌich i t-gewpkad.  
2CO04:9	We are persecuted, but never abandoned by God. We are knocked down, but not dead yet!  	Muꞌikko am t-shoꞌigchud. K wabshaba g Jiosh chum hekid t-wehmaj. Hebai am hi wa chum si s-koꞌokam has t-wua. Ch wabshaba pi t-koꞌijid.  
2CO04:10	In our bodies we always share in the death of Jesus, so that we can also demonstrate the life of Jesus in our bodies.  	Chum o hekid am hab chuꞌig g muhkig t-wehhejed mamt wa hab masma hab juh g Jesus. K hab masma am tasho e neid g Jesus doakag am t-doakag ed.  
2CO04:11	While we live we are always under the threat of death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal bodies.  	T-doakag oidch o am hab chuꞌig mattp hems wo t-muhkid am wehhejed g Jesus. K hab wa masma ab e chehgidch g Jesus doakag id amjed t-chuhkug mo am him muhkig wui.  
2CO04:12	As a result, we are facing death so that you may have life! 	S-ni-mukimakam o chum hekid am hab chuꞌig nani pi am hab junihim ihda chikpan. K am wa s-apꞌe namt pi id hekaj ab bei g wechij doakag. 
2CO04:13	Since we have the same spirit of trust in God that Scripture refers to when it says, “I trusted in God, and so I spoke out,” we also trust in God and speak out for him.  	Bo chuꞌig an Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana ed mash hema hab kaij: 
2CO04:16	So we don't give up. Even though our physical bodies are falling apart, our inner selves are being renewed daily.  	Heg att hekaj pi hekid haꞌichukaj an hu wo t‑shohbi matt am hab wo junihid ihda chikpan. Ab o hi wa chum aihim g muhkig g t‑chuhkug nach pi hekitahim. K wabshaba g t‑doakag wehs tashkaj ab i e wechijid.  
2CO04:17	These trivial troubles we have only last for a little while, but they produce for us an ever-increasing degree of glory.  	Hebaichujj ach hab hi wa elid mo shaꞌi si geꞌej g t‑kudutadag iia. K wabshaba heg ab wui t‑uꞌa g woho si geꞌe apꞌechudaj g Jiosh. Heg eda at g Jiosh chum hekid ab wo si has t‑elidad. T pi an hu wo haꞌichugk g jewed t ab t‑kudutadag.  
2CO04:18	We don't concern ourselves with what can be seen, for we look forward to what can't be seen. What we see is temporary, but what we can't see is eternal. 	Ab ach wui t‑gewpkadch hegai apꞌedag, chum achs hi wa chum pi neid g t‑wuhpuikaj. Hegai mach haschu i neid hemu at wabsh wo huhug. T wabshaba pi hekid wo huhug hegai mach am wui t‑gewpkadch. 
2CO05:1	We know that when this earthly “tent” we live in is taken down, we have a house prepared by God, not made by human hands. It is eternal and is in heaven.  	Ihda t‑chuhkug o heg wa wepo mo d wabsh uhksha nat pi wabsh wo e padch. Kutt wabshaba wo edgidad g baꞌich i s‑kehg honshpadag an dahm kahchim ch ed. T id g Jiosh hab wo t‑juni. Kut hab wo masmak mo g si s‑kehg kih ch pi hekid wo e padch.  
2CO05:2-3	We sigh with longing for this, wanting so badly to be clothed with this new heavenly home.  When we put on this clothing we won't be seen naked.  	Hebaichujj ach si i shahshani nach pi am chum s‑hihimimk dahm kahchim wui ch s‑behimk hegai s‑kehg honshpadag mat g Jiosh ab wo t‑mah.  
2CO05:4	While we are in this “tent” we sigh, being weighed down by this life. It's not so much that we want to take off the clothing of this life but that we look forward to what we shall be clothed with, so that what is mortal may be overwhelmed by life.  	Pi ach hab ahgch shahshani machs im hu hab i s‑junimk ihda t‑honshpadag ch wabshaba hab ahgch matt oi ab wo bei hegai wechij t‑honshpadag an dahm kahchim ch ed k pi d haha wo mukimkamk.  
2CO05:5	It's God himself who prepared us for all this, and who provided the Spirit as a guarantee to us.  	Jiosh at am i t‑apꞌech id wehhejed k ab t‑mah g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag mat wo t‑wehmajk ch am wo i wohokamch mo haschu ab t‑makiog. 
2CO05:6	So we remain confident, knowing that while we are at home here in our physical bodies, we are away from the Lord.  	Pegih, si ach s‑ap t‑tahtk ch ia chewed,  
2CO05:7	(For we live by trusting in God, not by seeing him).  	chum achs pi neid g t‑kownalig Jesus, nach pi ab s‑wohochud ch hab s‑ap himchud g t‑doakag.  
2CO05:8	As I say, we are confident, wanting to be away from the body so we can be at home with the Lord.  	Kuch wabshaba baꞌich i chum tatchua matt an wo i t‑chihwiapad wehmaj, chum achs wo dagito ihda t‑chuhkug.  
2CO05:9	That's why our goal, whether home here in our bodies or not, is to make sure we please him.  	K wabshaba pi has d shaꞌi ahga machs hebai hab chuꞌig. Id o baꞌich d i si haꞌichu matt am hab wo juh g tatchuij, chum achs ia wo haꞌichugk id dahm jewed o an wo wehmajk anai.  
2CO05:10	For all of us must appear before Christ's seat of judgment. Each of us will receive what we deserve for what we have done in this life, whether it is good or bad. 	Wehsijj att hemho wa am wo i t‑chehgi Christ wui mat am wo t‑aꞌappem k ab wo i t‑mahkhi g t‑namkidadag mattp has i masma s‑ap hab junihim o pi ap hab junihim hegai chikpan mo ab t‑mahkch iia. 
2CO05:11	Knowing how we are in awe of the Lord, we try to convince others. It's clear to God what we are, and I hope that it's clear to your minds too.  	S‑toꞌo ehbidam hab mahs g Jiosh lodaita. Kuni heg hekaj ab si i ha chehani g hemajkam mat wo hiwigi mat g Jiosh am wo i ha apꞌech e tahgio. S‑mahch o g Jiosh mo id d wohokam mani em‑ahgid. Kuni hab chum em‑elid mam ahpim hab waꞌap s‑mahch.  
2CO05:12	We are not trying to speak well of ourselves again, just trying to give you the opportunity to be proud of us, so you can answer those who are proud of outward show and not what they are inside.  	Pi ani hejel chum ni‑haꞌichuchud. K wabshaba muꞌijj ab si has ha elid hegam mo si s‑kehg hab mahs pi shaꞌi mahchk g ha‑iꞌibdag. Kuni am haꞌichu em‑ahgid mamt hekaj wo e nakog k ab wo uhpam i nodagi g ha‑neꞌoki.

2CO05:14	Christ's love urges us on, because we're absolutely sure that he died for everyone, and so everyone died.  	E at muhkid g Christ wehs t‑wehhejed no pi ab si t‑tatchua. Kuch hekaj ab aigo si tatchua ch hemho wa am hab s‑junimk g tatchuij. Id o heg wa wepo matt ahchim wehmaj koi  
2CO05:15	Christ died for everyone so that they shouldn't live any longer for themselves, but for him who died and rose again for them. 	nach pi hahawa pi am hu hab junimk g hejel t‑tatchui ch wabshaba heg tatchui am hab s‑junimk mat e muhkid k ep e chegito k i wuhsh t‑wehhejed. 
2CO05:16	From now on we don't look at anyone from a human point of view. Even though we once viewed Christ this way, we don't do so any longer.  	Heki ani hu wa hab ni‑elid mani s‑mahch mo has chuꞌig g hemajkam ch s‑mahch mat has wo chum chuꞌigkad hegai mat d wo Jiosh si Kehshak. Ni wabshaba hemuch id s‑mahchimk ab amjed g Jiosh.  
2CO05:17	That's why anyone who is in Christ is a new being—what was old is gone, the new has come!  	Do si wechij doakam matp hedai ab i e hemakoj g Christ wehm. Im at hu hab i e juh g hekiukam haꞌichu. T g wechij haꞌichu ab i wuhsh.  
2CO05:18	God did all this by changing us from enemies into friends through Christ. God gave us this same work of changing his enemies into his friends.  	Jiosh at wehs id hab juh. Heki ach hu wa d obgaj. T wabshaba g Christ am gawul t‑juh mach d hahawa naipijjuj g Jiosh k ab t‑chehani matt am wo i ahgahi g haꞌichu ahgaj mat haꞌijj hab waꞌap ab wo i nawojt g Jiosh.  
2CO05:19	For God was in Christ bringing the world back from hostility to friendship with him, not counting anyone's sins against them, and giving us this message to change his enemies into his friends.  	Id o d haꞌichu ni‑ahga mat g Jiosh ab chum i ha nawojt g hemajkam k gam hu hab i juh g ha‑chuꞌijig heg hekaj mat g Christ haschu hab juh ha wehhejed. 
2CO05:20	So we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God is pleading through us: “Please, won't you come back and be God's friend?”  	Neh, kuch si s‑hemajim ab em‑waid am wehhejed g Christ mamt ab wo i hiwigi g Jiosh mat am gawul wo i em‑juh mamt hahawa pi d wo obgajk.  
2CO05:21	God made Jesus, who never personally sinned, experience the consequences of sin so that we could have a character that is right as God is right. 	Wehs at ab abch g e‑alidag g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig mat heg hekaj ab wo t‑abch g Christ s‑apꞌekam ahchim matt ab wo i s‑wohoch. 
2CO06:1-2	As workers together with God we also plead with you not to make your acceptance of God's grace worthless.  Just as God said, “At the right time I heard you, and on the day of salvation I rescued you.”  Believe me: now is the right time! Now is the day of salvation!  	Bo chuꞌig an Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana ed mo hab kaij g Jiosh:

Pi g ab hu wabsh wo si e behꞌi ha ab hegam mo pi ab hu ihm g Jesus Christ. Shaht hig masma g s‑apꞌekam ab wo e wehnadk g pi apꞌekam? Shaht masma g tonlig ab wo e wehnadk g s‑chuhugam.

2CO06:16	What compromise could the Temple of God make with idols? For we are a temple of the living God, just as God said: “I will live in them and walk among them. I will be their God, and they will be my people.”  	Ab ach ihm g Jiosh. K pi hab chum chuꞌig machs haꞌichu ab ep wo ihmad. Jiosh o am t‑eda. K id heg wa wepo mach d cheopigaj. Neh, bo kaij g Jiosh: 
2CO07:1	Dear friends, since we have these promises, we should wash ourselves clean from all that makes both body and spirit dirty, aiming for complete holiness out of reverence for God.  	Neh, id ash hab kaij g Jiosh, ni‑wepnag, mat am hab wo t‑juni. Kutt hekaj ab hig wo si i t‑apꞌech heg amjed mo haschu uamhun g t‑chuhkug ch t‑doakag k am wo si i t‑dagito Jiosh wui ab si has elidch.

2CO07:5	When we arrived in Macedonia we didn't have a minute's peace. We were attacked from every direction, with external conflicts and inner fears.

2CO07:6	Even so, God who encourages the downhearted, encouraged us with Titus' arrival.  	K wabshaba g Jiosh chum hekid ab t‑mahk g gewkemhuna mach eda t‑kudut. Kunt wa ab i ni‑gewkemhu mat am ni‑nam g Titus.  
2CO07:7	Not just by his arrival, but also by the encouragement you gave him. He told us how you were longing to see me, how sorry you were, and how concerned you were about me, which made me even happier.  	Heg o si s‑ap e tahtk ch am ni‑ahgid mamsh chum si s‑ni‑neidamk ch si pi ap e tahtk heg hekaj mat haschu has e juh am em‑shahgid. K hab kaij mamsh ab ha wui gegok hegam mo has ni‑ahg. Kuni hekaj baꞌich i si s‑hehgig hemuch. 
2CO07:8-9	Even though I made you sorry by the letter I wrote, I don't regret it—though I did regret it because the letter did hurt you, but just for a while.  I'm happy now, not for hurting you, but because this pain led you to change your minds. You were made sorry in a way God would want, and so weren't harmed by us in any way.  	Si amsh pi ap e tahtk am neꞌokchulidk g ni‑oꞌohana. Kuni wa chum pi hohhoꞌid mant heg am em‑oꞌohani. Kumsh wabshaba pi tash pi ap e tahtk ch am wabsh i apꞌech hegai mash pi apꞌe am em‑shahgid. Jiosh at hekaj hegai em‑shoꞌigchudadag. Kuni hahawa si s‑ap ni‑tahtk.  
2CO07:10	The kind of sorrow God wants us to have makes us change our minds and brings salvation. This kind of sorrow leaves no sense of regret, but worldly sorrow brings death.  	Bo wa masma hekaj g Jiosh g pi ap tahhadkam am t‑doakag ed matt gam hu wo s‑ohhod g pi ap t‑chegitoi k wo bei g s‑ap tahhadkam. T wabshaba hegam mo pi ab hu e dagitokch Jiosh wui baꞌich im hu hab wo i e juh ab amjed mat ab wo ha ai g pi ap tahhadkam.  
2CO07:11	See what happened to you when you had this very same experience of sorrow that God wants. Remember how enthusiastic you became, how keen you were to defend yourselves, how angry you were at what had happened, how seriously you took it, how you longed to do right, how concerned you were, how you wanted justice to be done. In all of this you showed that you were sincere in wanting to make things right. 	S‑mahch am mat has em‑juh g Jiosh mamt pi ap e taht.

2CO07:13	We are so encouraged by this. Added to our own encouragement, we were so pleased to see how happy Titus was, because you set his mind at rest.  	Kuch ab i t‑gewkemhun mamtsh ab bei g i wehmta. 
2CO07:14	I boasted to him about you, and you didn't let me down. Just as all I've told you is true, my boasting about you to Titus has proved to be true too!  	nant pi si s‑ap has em‑ah ab wui.

2CO08:3	I can confirm that they gave what they could, in fact even more than that! By their own choice  	Bat juh ihda mahkig mat heꞌes i e nako, pej baꞌich i mo heꞌes i chum e nakog, wabsh hejel hab e elidk.  
2CO08:4	they kept on pleading with us to have a part in this privilege of sharing in this ministry to God's people.  	Ab at si t‑tai matt wo ha hiwigi mat hab wo juh ihda k hab masma am wo i ha wehmt hegam mo d Jiosh hemajkamga ch si e shoꞌigchud amai Judea t am.  
2CO08:5	They didn't just do what we hoped they would do, but they gave themselves to the Lord, and then to us, as God wanted them to do.  	Kut baꞌich am hab i juh mach heꞌes hab i chum ha elid nat pi wehs am i e dagito chikpanaj ed g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ mach has masma am ha tashogid.  
2CO08:6	So we have encouraged Titus—since it was he who started this work with you—to return and complete this gracious ministry of yours. 	Am at wa heki hu i chikp ihda g Titus. Kuni am si i chehani mat am wo i em‑wehmt k wo nahto ihda s‑kehg chikpan.  
2CO08:7	Since you have an abundance of everything—your trust in God, your eloquence, your spiritual knowledge, your complete dedication, and in your love for us—make sure that your abundance also extends to this gracious ministry of giving.  	Si am geꞌe haꞌichu ab apꞌedag ch ab si s‑wohochud g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch haꞌichu s‑mahch ab amjed g Jiosh ch s‑kehg neneok ch s‑wapagima ch ab si t‑tatchua. Kuch heg hekaj hab em‑elid mamt wo i ha wehmt hegam mo e shoꞌigchud am Judea ch ed. 
2CO08:8	I'm not ordering you to do this, but to prove how sincere your love is in comparison with the dedication of others.  	Pi ani ab hu s‑gewkam em‑chehani mamt hab wo juh ihda. Ni wabsh chum s‑mahchimk mas heꞌes i geꞌej g em‑pihk elidadag. Heg ani hekaj am em‑ahgid mat has masma hab juh g i wehmta idam haꞌi.  
2CO08:9	For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Even though he was rich, he became poor for you, so that through his poverty you could become rich.  	Am am wa s‑mahch mat has masma am chehgi g e‑hemajimatalig g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ. Dach wabsh shoꞌigkam. T heg an dagito g e‑kihdag ch e‑apꞌedag k shoꞌig ia haꞌichugkahim matt ahchim ab wo si i bei g apꞌedag. 
2CO08:10	This is my advice: it would be good if you finished what you started. Last year you were not only the first to give but the first to want to do so.  	Bani masma hab elid ihda mamt am wo i nahto hegai mamt wa am hab i chum juh haꞌakid. Ahpim amt wa wehpeg si s‑hohhoꞌid k am hab i junihi ihda i wehmta.  
2CO08:11	Now finish what you planned to do. Be as keen to finish as you were to plan, and give as you are able.  	Pegih, am g wo i e gewpkad k wo nahto. Bamt wa masma s‑wapagimam am wo i nahto mamt wa ged hu i wehpeg hab e juh.  
2CO08:12	If the willingness is there, it's fine to give what you have, not what you don't have!  	Mt wo s‑ap e taht k am hab wo juh mamt heꞌes wo i e nako. T g Jiosh wo wa s‑hohhoꞌi. 
2CO08:13-14	This is not to make things easier for others and harder for you, but simply to be fair.  At the moment you have more than enough and can meet their needs, and in turn when they have more than enough they can meet your needs. In that way everyone is treated fairly.  	Pi ani hab ahg mams ahpim wo e shoꞌigch am i ha wehmajch hegam wohochuddam mo e shoꞌigchud. Idani am haꞌichu s‑edgid ch hekaj wo i ha wehmt.

2CO08:15	As Scripture says, “The one who had much didn't have any excess, and the one who didn't have much didn't have too little.” 	Bat masma hab wo e juh hegai mo an hab chuꞌig Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana ed ch hab chuꞌig: 
2CO08:16	Thanks be to God that he gave to Titus the same devotion for you that I have.  	Titus o si pihk e elid em‑hekaj hab masma mani ahni. Kuni heg hekaj ab si i hoꞌigeꞌid g Jiosh.  
2CO08:17	Though he agreed to do what we told him, he's coming to see you because he really wants to, and had already decided to do so.  	S‑ap o e tahtk mani ab ahgid mat am wo i em‑wehmt ch am hejel si e nako mat am wo i em‑chehgim.  
2CO08:18	We're also sending with him a brother who is praised by all the churches for his work in spreading the good news.  	Am ani hema ep ahgid mat wo oi g Titus. Id o s‑ap ahgachug g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh. K heg hekaj wehsko ab si has elid g t‑wepnag.  
2CO08:19-21	He was also appointed by the churches to go with us as we deliver this gracious offering we're carrying. We do this to honor the Lord and to show our eagerness to help others.  We want to guard against anyone criticizing us about how we use this gift.  We're concerned to do things the right way, not only in the eyes of the Lord, but also in the eyes of everyone.  	K id d ha‑kehsha mat wo t‑oi matt am wo i ui g em‑mahkig ha wui hegam mach am i s‑ha wehmtamk. Si ach s‑t‑nenꞌoid matt s‑ap hab wo juh ihda em‑wehhejed. T hab pi hedai has wo t‑ahg k wabshaba ab wo has elidad g Jiosh. 
2CO08:22	We're also sending with them another brother who has proved to be reliable on many occasions, and who is eager to help. He is now even more eager to help because of the great confidence he has in you.  	Pegih, t am wo oi g Titus ihda t‑wehnag. Muꞌikko att am aꞌappe ab tahnich mat am wo i t‑wehmt. Kuki chum hekid s‑t‑wehmtamk, wahm hemuch no pi ab si has em‑elid.  
2CO08:23	If anyone asks about Titus, he is my companion. He works with me on your behalf. The other brothers are representatives from the churches and an honor to Christ.  	Kum s‑mahch mo g Titus d ni‑wehm chikpandam ch am wo i em‑wehmt. K idam haꞌi mat am wehmaj wo hihi am d ha‑chuhchai g t‑wepnag ch ab si haꞌichuchud g Christ.  
2CO08:24	So please welcome them before all the churches and show them your love, proving how rightly proud we are of you. 	Ab ani si s‑ap has em‑ahg am ha tahgio. Kumt am wo ha chehgi mam ab si ha tatchua. T hegam mat am i ha chuhcha wo s‑mahchk mani g wohokam am ha ahgid. 
2CO09:1-2	I really don't need to write to you about this offering for God's people.  I know how keen you are to help—I was boasting about this to those in Macedonia that you in Achaia have been ready for over a year, and your enthusiasm has encouraged many of them to give.  	S‑mahch ani mam tatchua mamt wo i ha wehmt g shoꞌigkam e‑wepnag, chum anis hems pi am hu wo em‑oꞌohani heg amjed.

2CO09:3	But I'm sending these brothers so that my boasting about you regarding this won't be proved wrong, and that you're prepared, just as I said you would be.  	Kuni idani am ha ahgid idam t‑wepnag mat am wo hihi em‑wui. Mt wo si e nahtokch heg hekaj e‑mahkig. Kut pi wabsh wo heki e wua g s‑kehg ni‑neꞌoki ab em‑amjed.  
2CO09:4	This is just in case some Macedonians should come with me and find you unprepared. We, not to mention you, would be really embarrassed if this project failed!  	Tp hems wo haꞌi t‑wehmajk g Macedonia t am hemajkam. Kunt wo si ni‑el mamtp pi wo e nahtokch mani eda si s‑ap em‑ahg am ha wui. Mt ahpim hab waꞌap wo si e el.  
2CO09:5	That's why I decided I should ask these brothers to visit you in advance, and complete the arrangements to collect this offering, so that it would be ready as a gift, and not as something demanded. 	Heg ani hekaj hab elid mo s‑apꞌe mant am wo si i ha cheha idam t‑wepnag mat am wehpeg wo hihim k am wo i em‑wehm apꞌech g em‑mahkig. Bat masma heki hu wo nahtoisk mant am haha wo jiwia.

2CO09:6	I want to remind you of this: If you only sow a little, you'll only reap a little; if you sow plenty, you'll reap plenty.  	S‑mahch am mat muꞌi wo nei g haꞌichu bahidag hegai mat muꞌi wo ei g haꞌichu kai. T pi ab hu muꞌi wo nei hegai mat pi muꞌi wo ei. Pegih, mt hab waꞌap muꞌi ab wo nei g apꞌedag mamtp s‑baꞌama ab wo haꞌichu ha mah am Jiosh wehhejed.  
2CO09:7	Everybody should give as they've already decided—not reluctantly, or because they have to, for God loves those who give with a cheerful spirit.  	Mt wabshaba hejel hab wo e ah mamt heꞌekia ab wo i ha mah. Pi o ab hu t‑chehani g Jiosh machs ab haꞌichu wo ha mah no pi s‑hohhoꞌid matt si s‑ap t‑taht k am hab wo juh g t‑mahkig k pi wo ge s‑daꞌad.  
2CO09:8	God is able to graciously provide you with everything, so that you will always have all you need—with plenty to help others too.

2CO09:9	As Scripture says, “He gives generously to the poor; his generosity is everlasting.” 	Neh, bo chuꞌig an Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana ed: 
2CO10:1	This is me Paul, personally appealing to you through Christ's kindness and gentleness, the one who is “shy” when I have to face you but who is “bold” when I'm not there. 	Haꞌijj amsh hab kaij manish s‑em‑kehꞌid wabsh em‑oꞌohanidch ch antsh ep wo s‑hemajimak am ep jiwiak. Pegih, bani wa masma chum si s‑hemajima mo g Christ.  
2CO10:2	I'm pleading with you, so that the next time I'm with you I won't have to be as tough as I think I'll have to be, boldly dealing with those who think we behave in worldly ways.  	Am g wabsh wo s‑dodolimak. Nt hab pi wo em‑kehꞌel am jiwiak. 
2CO10:3	Even though we live in this world, we don't fight as the world does.  	In ach d dodakam jewed dahm ch wabshaba pi hab masma hab t‑junihim mo hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh.  
2CO10:4-5	Our weapons are not of this world but God's mighty power that destroys fortresses of human thinking, demolishing misleading theories.  Every high wall that stands tall and proud against the knowledge of God is knocked down. Every rebel idea is captured and brought into obedient agreement with Christ.  	Hegam o ab wui gegok g Jiosh ch ha iattogid ch ab si haꞌichuchud g hejel haꞌichu e‑mahchig. K wabshaba ahchim ab t‑mahkch g Jiosh g gewkdag. Kuch heg gewkdagkaj wehs gewito ihda pi apꞌekam ch pi g hejel t‑gewkdagkaj.  
2CO10:6	When you are completely obeying Christ then we're ready to punish any disobedience. 	Pegih, am amt wo i e chehgi mam am wehs e dagitokch id eda Christ himdag. Nt haha wo s‑koꞌokam ha namkid hegam mo am wa haꞌichukaj pi am hu wehs i e dagitokch. 
2CO10:7	Look at what's staring you in the face! Anyone who considers that they belong to Christ should think again—just as they belong to Christ, so do we!  	Haꞌi amki ab wabsh dahmjed haꞌichu neid ch hab chum si e elid mam d si Christ pionag. Am g wo si i e oidahim. Ahchim ach hab wa masma d Christ pionag mamtp has i masma hab e elid.  
2CO10:8	Even though I may seem to be boasting a little too much about our authority, I'm not embarrassed about it. The Lord gave this authority to us to build you up, not to knock you down.  	Pi ani shaꞌi si ni‑elid am heꞌes i em‑ahgidch ab amjed ihda gewkdag mat g t‑kownalig Jesus ab ni‑mah. Ab o ni‑mahkch mant hekaj am wo i em‑gewkemhun k pi gam hu hab wo i em‑juh ab amjed.  
2CO10:9	I'm not trying to scare you by my letters.  	Pi ani hab ahgch am em‑oꞌohanid manis wo em‑tods.  
2CO10:10	People say, “His letters are tough and severe, but in person he's feeble, and he's a useless speaker.”  	Tp hems hema hab wo chei, “Paul o si s‑ta keꞌidam kaij ab t‑oꞌohanidch ch wabshaba ia t‑wui jijiwhia ch pi gewkdag. K g neꞌokij d wabsh pi haꞌichu.”  
2CO10:11	People like that should realize that what we <span class="it">say</span> through letters when we're not there we will <span class="it">do</span> when we are there!  	T eda hegai mat hab wo wa chei wo chum s‑mahchk mant hab wa masma hab wo chei hekid am em‑wehmajkch mani has i kaij am ni‑oꞌohana ed. 
2CO11:1-2	I hope you can put up with a little more foolishness from me—well you already do put up with me!  I agonize over you with a divine kind of jealousy, for I promised you to a single husband—Christ—so that I could present you as a pure virgin to him.  	Pi o hab chum chuꞌig manis hab masma hejel ni‑wehhejed wo neokad. Kuni eda ab si em‑tatchua am wehhejed g Christ. Kumt hekaj ab wo ni‑kaiha. Bam sha masma mam d hohntaj. Kuni si s‑em‑daꞌa hab masma mo g Jiosh mamt wo si e nuhkud g Christ wehhejed.  
2CO11:3	I worry that in some way, just as the serpent deceived Eve with his devious cunning, that you might be led astray in your thinking from your sincere and pure commitment to Christ.  	Am g wo s‑chegitok matsh wa pi wohoch g Jiosh hegai wehpeg uwi mash hab chehgig Eve. Jiawul atsh wa s‑aꞌagi iattogi am gahi wuhshanim g wamad.

2CO11:4	If anyone comes and tells you about a different Jesus to the one we shared with you, you easily go along with them, accepting a different spirit to the one you received, and a different kind of good news to the one you believed. 	namsh pi ha hiwgid ch ab ha kaiham.

2CO11:6	Even though I may not be skilled in giving speeches, I do know what I'm talking about. We have made this absolutely clear to you in every way.  	M o hi wa woho mani pi am hu i si s‑mahch g amogida. Kuni wabshaba s‑mahch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch am em‑wui i tashogid. 
2CO11:7	Was it wrong of me to humble myself so you could be elevated, since I shared the good news with you at no charge?  	Haꞌi amsh hab ni‑elid mani pi ab hu ni‑haꞌichuchud pi shaꞌi em‑hiwgidch mams ab wo ni‑namkid. Ni eda am hab ni‑junihim mant g s‑apꞌekam am hab wo em‑juni.  
2CO11:8-9	I robbed as it were other churches, taking pay from them so I could work for you.  When I was there with you and needed something, I wasn't a burden to anyone because the believers who came from Macedonia took care of my needs. I was determined never to be a burden to you and I never shall.  	Tatchua ani g lial ch wabshaba pi tatchua manis wo em‑wechhu. T hegam wohochuddam mo am aꞌai kihhim Macedonia jewed ch ed ab ni‑mamka mani haschu i tatchua. 
2CO11:10	This is as certain as the truth of Christ that is in me: nobody in all Achaia will stop me boasting about this!  	Am ani em‑ahgid wehsko Greece jewed ch ed mant pi wo em‑hiwigi mams ab wo ni‑namkid mani eda am ahgachug g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga em‑shahgid.  
2CO11:11	And why? Because I don't love you? God knows that I do!  	Pi ani heg hekaj hab kaij ihda manis pi ab hu em‑tatchua. Jiosh o s‑mahch mani ab si em‑tatchua.  
2CO11:12	I'll continue to do what I've always done, so as to remove any opportunity for those who want to boast that their work is the same as ours.  	K wabshaba haꞌi hab chum kaij mash hab masma chikpan mani ahni. Ni eda ahni pi haꞌichu em‑kowlant. K idam hi em‑kowlant ch hab em‑iattogid. Am ash chum ni‑wepo e wua ahni mani d Christ kehsha. Pegih, t hemho wa wo chum ahgad g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga pi ab hu haꞌichu em‑kowlantch.  
2CO11:13	These people are false apostles, dishonest workers, who pretend to be apostles of Christ.  	K wabshaba pi d wohokam Christ chuhchai ch haꞌichu ha iattogid ch chum t‑wepo e wua ahchim mach d si s‑wohom Christ chuhchai.  
2CO11:14-15	Don't be surprised at this for even Satan himself pretends to be an angel of light.  So it's no wonder then if those who serve him pretend to be agents of good. But their final end will be in accordance with what they've done. 	Am o wa tasho mat hab masma hab wo e wuad no pi d Jiawul pionag. Jiawul o chum e wepogid g s‑apꞌekam anghil. T g piongaj hab waꞌap wo e wepogidad ahchim mach am ahgachug g s‑apꞌekam. T wabshaba g Jiosh s‑koꞌokam wo ha namkid heg hekaj. 
2CO11:16	Let me say it again: please don't think I'm being foolish. However, even if you do, accept me as someone who is foolish, and let me also boast a little.  	Haꞌi amsh hab ni‑elid mani wabsh pehegi neok. Nt eda am wo em‑ahgi g wohokam ab amjed g ni‑chikpan. Ab g wo kaiham mant has wo chei.  
2CO11:17	What I'm saying is not as the Lord would say it—all this foolish boasting.  	Pi o ab hu ni‑chehani g t‑kownalig Jesus mant hab kaidam wo neokad.  
2CO11:18	But since many others are boasting in the way the world does, let me boast too.  	Nt wabshaba am hab wo ni‑juh no pi muꞌijj wabsh hejel si e haschud.

2CO11:21	I'm so sorry that we were too weak to do anything like that! But whatever people dare to boast about, I dare to do too. (Here I'm talking like a fool again). 	Haꞌi ash hab ni‑elid mani pi hab masma ab em‑wui mo hegam nani pi si ni‑elid. Pegih, woho o wa mant wo si ni‑el mantp hab wo masmak. Hegam o si e haschud ch e wehhejed neneok.

2CO11:23	Are they servants of Christ? (This will sound like I'm talking crazy). But I have done so much more. I've worked harder, been imprisoned more often, whipped more times than I can count, faced death time and again.  	Bo kaij mo d Christ pionag.

2CO11:26	During my many journeys I have faced the dangers of crossing rivers, robber gangs, attacks from my own countrymen, as well as from foreigners. I have faced danger in cities, in the deserts, and on the sea. I have faced the danger of people who pretend to be Christians.  	S‑to o ehbidama am ni‑wehhejed mani hebai i oimmed.

2CO12:7	Also, because these revelations were so amazingly great, and so that I wouldn't become proud, I was given a “thorn in my flesh” a messenger from Satan to hurt me so that I wouldn't become proud.  	Pi o hab mahs manis wo si ni‑haꞌichuchudad heg hekaj mo haschu am ni‑chehgid g Jiosh. K g t‑kownalig Jesus hiwgid g Jiawul mat wo i ni‑mumkichud k wo ni‑kudutad mant pi ab hu wo si ni‑haꞌichuchudad.  
2CO12:8	I pleaded with the Lord three times to get rid of this problem.  	Waikko ant ab chum si ni‑hoꞌigeꞌidahu Jesus wui ab tahnich mat gam hu hab wo i juh ihda ni‑mumkidag.  
2CO12:9	But he told me, “My grace is all you will need, for my power is effective in weakness.” That's why I happily boast about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may reside in me.  	Kut hab masma i nodagi g e‑neꞌoki, “Baꞌich at i s‑ap wo e chehgi g ni‑gewkdag ab m‑ab mapt wabsh s‑ap wo nakogad g e‑shoꞌigdag napt pi pi wo e nako maps hejel wo nako. Heg waꞌi ni‑gewkdagkaj apt wo e nako.” 
2CO12:10	So I appreciate weaknesses, insults, troubles, persecutions, and difficulties that I suffer for Christ's sake. For when I'm weak, then I'm strong! 	Heg o am chehgidch g e‑gewkdag am ni‑wehhejed mani hekid i mukialig. Kuni heg hekaj wabsh si s‑ap ni‑tahtk mani mukialig ch ab nakog g s‑koꞌok has ahgadag ch s‑wehch haꞌichu ch shoꞌigchudadag ch kudutadag wehhejed g Christ. 
2CO12:11	I'm talking like a fool, but you made me do it! You should really have been speaking well of me, for in no way am I inferior to the super-apostles,  even though I don't count for anything.  	Ab o em‑ab mamt ni‑wehhejed wo neneokad ab ha wui hegam mash has ni‑ahg am em‑shahgid. Msh wabshaba pi hab e wua.

Pegih, m haschu ahgch baꞌich ab has i ha elid hegam mash wabsh em‑iattogid.  
2CO12:12	Yet the marks of an apostle were patiently demonstrated among you—signs, wonders, and powerful miracles.  	Bani wa junihim g s‑hasig haꞌichu ch muꞌi haꞌichu ab nakog mani wa eda am ahg g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga em‑wui. K id am chehgidch mani d Christ kehsha.  
2CO12:13	In what way were you inferior to the other churches except I wasn't any burden to you? Please forgive me for doing you wrong! 	S‑ap ani hab ni‑junihim ab em‑wui hab wa masma mani ab wehs ha wui hegam mo an aꞌai d Christ ihmdam, heg hi wa mani pi em‑hiwgid mams ab wo haꞌichu ni‑namkid. Ab g wabsh wo s‑ni‑hoꞌigeꞌid mani pi em‑hiwgid. 
2CO12:14	Now I'm preparing to visit you for the third time, and I won't be a burden to you. I don't want what you have, I want you yourselves! After all, children shouldn't save up for their parents, but parents should for their children.  	Id o d i waikkokam mant am wo i em‑chehgim.

2CO12:15	I will happily spend myself, and be spent, for you. If I love you so much more, will you love me even less?  	Am o wa s‑apꞌe mant am wo hugio g haꞌichu ni‑eniga ch ni‑doakag em‑wehhejed. Ab ani baꞌich i si pihk ni‑elid em‑wui mo g jehj ab e‑aꞌaliga ha wui. Kumt heg hekaj ab wo chum si ni‑tatchuad. 
2CO12:16	Well, even if that's so, I wasn't a burden to you. Maybe I was being devious, and tricked you with my cunning ways!  	S‑mahch am mani pi haꞌichukaj shaꞌi em‑wechun. Kumsh eda haꞌi hab kaij manish wabsh em‑iattogid  
2CO12:17	But did I take advantage of you by anyone I've sent to you?  	ch ui g em‑lialiga hejel ni‑wehhejed. Pi o woho ihda. Am ant ha cheha hegam Titus mat am wo hihim k wo i hemapai g lial g shoꞌigkam ha wehhejed.  
2CO12:18	I urged Titus to go and see you, and I sent another brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? No, we both have the same spirit and use the same methods.  	K hegam wabsh s‑ap haꞌichu hab elid ch am hab e junihim mani ahni has i masma. 
2CO12:19	Maybe you're thinking that all along we've been just trying to defend ourselves. No, we speak for Christ before God. Everything we do, friends, is for your benefit.  	Naꞌams haꞌi hab ni‑elid mani gam hu wabsh chum ni‑oan id hekaj mani wa hab kaij. K eda pi hab chuꞌig. Am ani Jiosh tahgio hab kaij hegai mo d Christ tatchui. K wehs hegai mach haschu hab i junihim d i em‑wehmtadag. 
2CO12:20	I do worry when I visit that somehow I won't find you as I would want to, and that you won't find me as you would want to! I'm afraid that there will be arguments, jealousy, anger, rivalry, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorder.  	S‑gihug ani mant wo cheh am jiwiak mamt gawul wo masmak mani hab masma chum em‑tatchuid. Mt ahpim hab waꞌap wo cheh mant ahni gawul wo masmak mam has i chum ni‑tatchuid.

2CO12:21	I'm afraid that when I visit, my God will humble me in your presence, and that I will be weeping over many of those who have sinned previously, and who still have not repented of impurity, sexual immorality, and indecent acts that they committed. 	T heg wo ni‑mah g si edadag am Jiosh tahgio. Kunt wo shoakad mamtki koi gam hu s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegitoi k pi ap e nuhkud ch ha ehsid g ha‑wehm kihkam ch s‑tohntom has e wua ch g pi apꞌekam tatchua.

2CO13:4	Even though he was crucified in weakness, now he lives through the power of God. We too are weak in him, but you will see that we live with him through the power of God.  	Woho o wa mat e wepogi g shoꞌig pi gewpkam oꞌodham k ab e muhkid kots t ab. T wabshaba g Jiosh am chehgi g e‑gewkdag. K g Christ hahawa ep doakam heg gewkdagkaj. 
2CO13:5	Examine yourselves to see if you are trusting God. Put yourselves to the test. Don't you yourselves realize that Jesus Christ is in you? Unless you have failed the test…  	Am g wo si e mamche k am hejel wo i e aꞌamich mams am hi wa s‑ap hab chuꞌig e‑wohochudadag oidch. Mt wo wa chum s‑ap s‑mahchk mam ab uꞌukch g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag mamtp woho d wohochuddam  
2CO13:6	However, I hope that you realize that we have not failed the test. 	k hab wa masma wo s‑mahchk mani ahni hab waꞌap woho d wohochuddam.  
2CO13:7	We pray to God that you won't do anything bad—not so we can show we passed the test, but so you can do what is good, even if we appear to be failures.  	Ab ani si ni‑hoꞌigeꞌidahun Jiosh wui mamt pi am hu hab wo junihid g pi apꞌekam ch wabshaba g s‑apꞌekam am hab wo junihid, chum as wo pi ap ni‑ahgad hegam mo s‑ni‑kehꞌid.  
2CO13:8	We can't do anything against the truth, only for the truth.  	Pi att wo t‑nako matt wo shohbi g wohokam. Hemho wa att am wo wohokamch.  
2CO13:9	We're happy when we are weak, and you are strong—we pray that you may continue to improve.  	Tt wo s‑ap t‑taht k ab wabsh wo i t‑shoꞌigch mamtp ahpim wo i gewpka am e‑wohochudadag ed. Ab ach si t‑hoꞌigeꞌidahun mamt wehs ab wo i e dagito k am s‑ap wo i e nahto.  
2CO13:10	That is why I write about this while I'm not with you, so that when I am with you I won't have to treat you harshly by imposing my authority. The Lord gave me authority for building up, not for tearing down. 	T‑kownalig Jesus o ab ni‑mahkch g gewkdag mant wo shohbi g pi em‑apꞌekam. Kunt am i em‑oꞌohani mamt hekaj am wo i apꞌech mant eda koi jiwia. Nt hab pi wo em‑kehꞌel am jiwiak. Do Jiosh hab elida mant am wo i em‑gewkemhu. Kuni hab pi em kehꞌidamk. 
2CO13:11	Finally, brothers and sisters, I say goodbye. Continue to improve spiritually. Encourage one another. Be in agreement. Live in peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you.  	Pegih, ni‑wepnag, haꞌas ant hab wo chei. Am g wo i e nakogi mamt wehs ab wo i e dagito Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag wui. T heg wehs wo i em‑apꞌech.

2CO13:12	Greet each other with Christian affection.  	Ab g aꞌai wo si e tatchuad. 
2CO13:13-14	All the believers here send their greetings.  May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all.	Ab o si s‑em‑hoꞌigeꞌid g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ. K g Jiosh ab si em‑tatchua. K g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ab em‑makiog g gewkdag mamt ab aꞌai e wui wo si s‑ap e tahtkkad. 
2JN01:3	May grace, mercy and peace continue to be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and in love. 	Ab o wa si s-em-hoꞌigeꞌid g t-ohg Jiosh g e-alidag Jesus Christ wehm ch ab wo wa baꞌich i em-mah g i wehmtadag ch s-ap tahhadkam. Kumt ab wo uꞌukchid g wohokam ch wo si pihk e elidad wehs ha hekaj. 
2JN01:4	I was delighted to discover that some of your children are following the truth, just as the Father commanded us.  	Si ani s-ap ni-tahtk ch ia haꞌi ha neid g em-wehm kihkam. K idam an uꞌukch g wohokam hab masma mo ab t-chehani g Jiosh.  
2JN01:5	Now I'm telling you, dear lady, not as a new instruction, but following what we've understood from the beginning, that we should love one another.  	Kuni ab wehs i em-gewkemhun mamt ab aꞌai e wui wo si pihk e elidad. Pi o d wechij chehanig ihda mani am em-ahgid. Edgid ach ihda ged hu i shohshon k amjed.  
2JN01:6	This is what love is: we should follow God's commands. The command, just as you heard right from the beginning, is that you should live in love. 	Kutt ab aꞌai t-wui wo si pihk t-elidad ch hekaj am wo t-chehgidad mach ab s-wohog elid ihda chehanigaj g Jiosh. 
2JN01:7	I'm telling you this because many deceivers have left and gone out into the world. They don't accept that Jesus Christ has come as a human being. Anyone like this is a deceiver and an antichrist.  	Muꞌi at an i wuwha mo chum s-ha mashchamamk g hemajkam ch eda d wabsh s-chu iꞌattomkam ch d obgaj g Jiosh alidag no pi pi ha mashcham mat ia mahsi k d oꞌodham hab masma mach ahchim.

2JN01:9	All those who become extremists and don't continue to follow the teaching of Christ don't have God with them. Those who continue to follow the teaching of Christ have both the Father and the Son with them.  	Hegam matp hedai am gawul wo juh g Jiosh alidag mashchama o pi shaꞌi mahch g Jiosh. S-mahch ach g Jiosh ch ep s-mahch g alidaj ahchim mach am oidch hab masma g alidaj mashchama.  
2JN01:10	If people come to you and don't show evidence of Christ's teaching, don't take them in, don't welcome them—  	Kumt heg hekaj pi ab hu wo ha kaihamad hegai mat hedai wo chum s-em-mashchamam k eda pi wo ahgachugad g Jiosh alidag mashchama. Pi g am hu wo i ha wahpkid e-kihki ed k chum hems pi hab wo chei ab ha wui. “Jiosh at wo wa em-wehmajk,”  
2JN01:11	for if you encourage them you share in their evil work. 	mamt pi ab hu wo i ha wehmt hegam mat am wo ahgachugad g pi wohokam. 
2JN01:12	I have so many things to tell you that I won't write any more with paper and ink, for I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face. How happy that would make us!  	Muꞌi ani haꞌichu s-em-ahgidamk ch wabshaba pi id hekaj am i em-oꞌohani nani pi am s-himimk mant wo em-neid k wo em-wehm neo. Kutt am t-wehm si s-ap wo t-tahtkk. 
2JN01:13	Greetings to you from the children of your chosen sister.	Ia o haꞌi kih g t-wepnag ch ash si pihk e elid em-hekaj.
2PE01:2	May you have ever more grace and peace as you grow in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.  	S-mahch am g Jiosh ch ep s-mahch g t-kownalig Jesus. K heg hekaj ab si s-em-hoꞌigeꞌid ch ab baꞌich wo i em-mahkad g s-ap tahhadkam. 
2PE01:3	Through his divine power we have been given everything that's important to live a God-centered life. This comes through knowing him who called us to himself by his own glory and goodness. 	Pegih, s-mahch ach g Jiosh. K heg hekaj ab t-mahkch wehs hegai mach tatchua matt hekaj s-ap wo himchudad g t-doakag ch d wo s-apꞌekamk. Ab at i t-gawulkai ab t-chehgidch g si s-tondam e-gewkdag ch s-e-apꞌekam.  
2PE01:4	Through these promises you can share in the divine nature, being rid of the corruption caused by this world's evil desires.  	Si geꞌe haꞌichu atsh hab wo t-juni g Jiosh. Kumt ab i s-wohochud k hab wo edgidad g Jiosh doakag ch wo e doꞌibia ab amjed hegai pi apꞌekam mo in haꞌichug heg hekaj pi ap ha-tatchui g hemajkam. 
2PE01:5	For this same reason, do everything you can! Add to your trust in God, goodness; add to goodness, knowledge;  	Pegih, ab o em-mahks g wohochudadag. Kumt wo si e nakogad mamt wo s-apꞌek ch am wo si i mamche g s-apꞌekam  
2PE01:6	add to knowledge, self-control; add to self-control, patience; add to patience, reverence;  	ch wo s-dodolimak ch s-chechojim ab wo nakogad haꞌichu ch ab wo ihmad g Jiosh.  
2PE01:7	add to reverence, affection for fellow-believers, add to affection for fellow-believers, love. 	Ab o em-ab mamt ab ep wo si ha tatchuad g e-wehm wohochuddam ch ab wo si pihk e elidad chum hems ha hekaj g hemajkam.  
2PE01:8	The more you have these qualities, the more they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.  	Neh, id amt wehs eda am wo e nakogad ch hekaj s-wapagim am hab wo junihid g tatchuij g t-kownalig Jesus Christ.  
2PE01:9	For anyone who doesn't have such qualities is short-sighted, or blind. They forget that they've been cleansed from their past sins.  	Kutp hedai pi hab wo junihid ihda ch hab wo masmak mo g pi neadam no pi pi ap neid mat gam hu hab i juh g Jiosh g pi ap chuꞌijigaj. 
2PE01:10	So, brothers and sisters, be all the more determined to make sure you are truly “called and chosen.” If you do this, you won't ever fall. 	Neh, mt hekaj am baꞌich wo i si e nako mamt si s-wihnam wo bei hegai mat haschu wehhejed ab i em-waid k ab i em-gawulkai g Jiosh. T hab pi hekid hab wo e juh mams wo i shul ab amjed g Jiosh.  
2PE01:11	You will receive a tremendous welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. 	Jiosh at s-ap ab wo em-mah g apꞌedag mamt am wo i wahp t-doꞌibiakam Jesus Christ kownaltalig ed. 
2PE01:12	That's why I always remind you about these things, even though you know them already, and you stand firm in the truth that you possess.  	Heki amki hu s-mahch ihda mani ia em-ahgid ch s-wihnam gegok heg eda wohokam mamt ab bei. Nt wabshaba am wo i em-chechegitolidad mamt wo s-chegitok ch ab s-ap wo bei g e-apꞌedag.  
2PE01:13-14	But I still think it's a good idea to encourage you by giving you reminders while I live.  I know the time when I shall leave this life will be coming soon— our Lord Jesus Christ has made this clear to me.  	E o aihim mant im hu hab wo i ni-juh mad hab ni-ahgid g t-kownalig Jesus Christ. Ni hekaj hab ni-ahg mant am wo si em-chechegitolidad wehs ihda am hugkam mant hebai hugkam d wo doakamk.  
2PE01:15	I will do my best so that when I'm gone you will always be able to remember these things. 	Am ant wo i ni-nako mant am wo oꞌoha wehs ihda. Mt hab masma chum hekid wo s-chegitokad am i dahm mant hekid im hu hab wo i ni-juh. 
2PE01:16	We didn't follow made-up myths when we told you about the coming in power of our Lord Jesus Christ—we saw his majesty for ourselves. 	Ia atsh ep wo jiwia g t-kownalig Jesus Christ jewed dahm. T g gewkdaj am ep wo e chehgi. Wohokam ach am em-ahgid id amjed ch pi g hohoꞌoki aꞌagida ahchim machd heki hu am neid g si s-tondam gewkdaj g si t-wuhpuikaj.  
2PE01:17	He received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice of majestic glory spoke to him and announced, “This is my Son, the one I love, and who truly pleases me.”  	An achd wehmaj g Jesus. Kud g ohgaj Jiosh ab mah g si has elidadag k ab neok ch hab kaij, “Id o d si ni-tatchuidch ni-alidag.”  
2PE01:18	We ourselves heard this voice speak from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain. 	Id achd kah mo ab neok dahm kahchim t amjed anai machd an wehmaj doꞌag dahm. 
2PE01:19	We also have the confirming word of prophecy that's absolutely trustworthy, and you will benefit from paying close attention to it. It's like a lamp that shines in a dark place until the day dawns, and the morning star rises in your hearts.  	Id o am si wohokamchud mo haschu heki hu am ahg g Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam. Haꞌichu ha-ahga o wabsh heꞌes ab i t-mahkch g amichudadag hab sha masma matp hems g kanjel t-tonlidch am s-chuhugam k ed.

Mt heg hekaj wo s-chegitok g haꞌichu ha-ahga g Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam k ab wo e dagitokch Jesus wui.  
2PE01:20-21	Most of all you should realize that no prophecy of scripture is a matter for interpretation based on the whims of an individual,  for no prophecy originated in human ideas, but prophets spoke for God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. 	Haꞌichu ha-ahga o pi d wabsh hemajkam haꞌichu ha-ahga. Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag o am ha tashogid g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. T heg hekaj pi hedai wo e nako mas wabsh g hejel e-mahchigkaj wo i tashogi g haꞌichu ha-ahga. 
2PE02:1	But just as there were false prophets among the people then, there will be false teachers among you. They subtly introduce false and destructive teachings, even denying the Lord who redeemed them, quickly bringing destruction on themselves.  	An atsh wa haꞌi i wuwha mash wa e wepogid g Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam ch wabshaba wabsh ha iattogid g hemajkam. Kut hab waꞌap in wo i wuwha em-shahgid hegam mat wo chum em-mashcha g pi wohokam k wo padch g em-wohochudadag. Jesus Christ o d t-doꞌibiakam. K wabshaba idam pi wohokamchud. S-hohtam at im hu hab wo i ha juh g Jiosh mat hekid wo e ai g ha-tashga.  
2PE02:2	Many will follow their immoral perversions, and because of them people will condemn the way of truth.  	Muꞌijj at am ha oidch hab wo junihid g s-bihtagi haꞌichu hab ha-juni. T heg hekaj muꞌi hemajkam wo pad has ahgad g Jesus himdag.  
2PE02:3	They will greedily exploit you with false tales. However they are already condemned: their sentence has been hanging over them for a long time, their destruction won't be postponed.  	Hegam mo em-iattogid ab amjed g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga o wabsh s-uꞌimkch g em-lialiga. K wabshaba am e nahtokch g Jiosh mat wo ha lodait k im hu hab wo i ha juh. 
2PE02:4	For God didn't even spare the angels when they sinned. He threw them into Tartarus, holding them in dark pits ready for judgment.  	Si o tasho mo e aihim g lodaita tash. Haꞌi atsh am shul g anghil pi apꞌekam ch ed. Tsh g Jiosh am ha shul s-chuhugam k ed k am ha uꞌukch mat haha wo ha lodai geꞌe lodaita tash ed. 
2PE02:5	God didn't spare the ancient world either, but he protected Noah who told people about the God who did right. He was one of the eight who were saved when God sent a flood upon a world of evil people. 	Muꞌijj g heki hu hemajkam ash wa pi ab hu wohog elid g Jiosh. Kutsh hab juh g geꞌe wiꞌindag matsh ha wiꞌin. Sh eda am wa chum ahgahim g s-apꞌekam ihda mash hab chehgig Noah. Tsh id doꞌibia g Jiosh ch wewaꞌak ehp g wehmaj kihkam. 
2PE02:6	God condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to total destruction, burning them to ash, as an example of what will happen to those who live evil lives.  	Sh gam hu baꞌich, kush shaꞌi si pi apꞌe hegam mash am d kihkam Sodom ch Gomorra t am. Tsh g Jiosh am wabsh i ha hugio idam kihhim g meikaj mat wo ha chehgi g pi ap hemajkam mat has wo ha juh.  
2PE02:7-8	But God rescued Lot because he was a good man, sickened by the disgusting immorality of his neighbors.  (Lot lived among them, but he did what was good and right. He saw and heard what they did day after day, and their wickedness tormented him.) 	Kush am hema kih g s-apꞌekam oꞌodham ch hab chehgig Lot ch si s-wohom pi hohhoꞌid g pi ap haꞌichu hab ha-juni. Tsh id g Jiosh doꞌibia matsh hekid i ha hugio hegam kihhim. 
2PE02:9	As you can see, the Lord is able to rescue from their troubles those who respect him, and to keep the wicked until the day of judgment when their punishment is completed.  	Wehs ihda o am t-tashogid mo g Jiosh e nahtokch mat wo ha doꞌibia g s-apꞌekam oꞌodham ab amjed g ha-kudutadag k s-koꞌokam ab wo ha namkid g pi apꞌekam mat wo e ai g geꞌe lodaita tash.  
2PE02:10	This is especially so for those who follow their corrupt human desires, and contemptuously disregard authority. Arrogant and proud, they're not even afraid to defame heavenly beings.  	Jiosh at baꞌich i si s-koꞌokam wo ha namkid hegam mo d wabsh totonto ch pi ap hekaj g e-chuhkug ch pi ab hu wohog elid g t-kownalig Jesus Christ. 
2PE02:11	Angels, on the other hand, even though they are stronger and more powerful, don't disparage them before the Lord. 	Anghil o ha baꞌich i s-gewpkdag ch eda pi shaꞌi koꞌokam ab ha abchud hegam hahaꞌichu am tahgio g Jiosh.  
2PE02:12	These people are like mindless beasts, produced like farm animals to be captured and slaughtered. They condemn things they don't know anything about, and just like animals they will be destroyed.  	K eda hegam s-chu iꞌattomkam pi haꞌichu am hu chegito hab masma mo g mischini haꞌichu doakam ch s-koꞌokam has ahg hegai mo haschu pi amichud. T g Jiosh wo ha hugio hab masma mamtp hems wo mua g haꞌichu doakam.  
2PE02:13	They will be paid back in harm for the harm they have done. Their idea of fun is to commit their evil lusts in broad daylight. They are stains and blemishes on your community. They enjoy their deceptive pleasures even while they eat together with you.  	S-koꞌokam at ab wo bei g e-namkidadag heg hekaj mo am hab junihim g pi apꞌekam. Dash ha-hohhoꞌida mat chum hems tash ed hab wo junihid g si s-uam haꞌichu. Am ash em-wehm e gegosid. K d si edadag mo hab s-junimk g iattogida.  
2PE02:14	They're always on the lookout for adulterous relationships—they just can't stop sinning. They seduce the vulnerable; they have trained themselves in greed; they are offspring under a curse.  	Heg o waꞌi tatchua mat g uꞌuwi an wo ha neidad ch pi ap haꞌichu am wo chegitod.

2PE02:15	They have abandoned the right path and went astray, following the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved to be paid for doing evil.  	Heki at hu i e mehkod ab amjed g s-apꞌekam hab masma matsh wa hema hab e juh mash hab chehgig Balaam.

2PE02:16	But he was told off for his evil actions—a dumb donkey spoke with a human voice and stopped the prophet's foolishness! 	Tsh g Jiosh shohbi g pi ap haꞌichu hab elidaj am hab juhk g wuhlu shoigaj mat haha wabsh neo. 
2PE02:17	People like these are springs without water, mists blown away by the wind. They are destined for blackest darkness—forever.

Jiosh at am wo ha shul si s-chuhugam k ed.  
2PE02:18	Inflated with their own nonsense, they appeal to sensual desires, luring back into immorality those who have only just escaped from those who live in error.  	Chum o si s-gimaim ch pehegi neneok ch s-uam haꞌichukaj i ha wanchshulig hegam mo chum e nakog mat wo e doꞌibia  
2PE02:19	They promise them freedom, even though they themselves are slaves to depravity. “You are a slave to whatever conquers you.”  	no pi am ha ahgid mo wabsh chum haschu s-apꞌe ch eda hejel e wupulshch g pi apꞌekamkaj. Matp haschukaj wo e gewito g oꞌodham k heg hekaj wo e wulshchid. 
2PE02:20	If people manage to escape from the evil influence of the world by knowing the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and then get tangled up in sin again and are defeated, they are worse off than they were in the first place.  	Hegam s-chu iꞌattomkam at s-mai g wohokam ab amjed g t-kownalig Jesus Christ k hekaj wo chum e doꞌibia. Kut heg hekaj baꞌich wo i pi apꞌek mat am ep wo e wupulsh g pi apꞌekamkaj.  
2PE02:21	It would have been better not to have known the right way of truth, than to have known it and then turn away from the sacred instructions they'd been given.  	Ab o ha mahkch g Jiosh g haꞌichu e-ahga. K wabshaba baꞌich i s-apꞌe mat hems pi wo kah matp wabsh gam hu wo s-ohhod.  
2PE02:22	This proverb has come true for them: “The dog has returned to its own vomit, and the washed pig has gone back to rolling in the mud.” 	T am wo e wohokamch ihda hab ha-cheꞌidag: 
2PE03:1	My friends, this is my second letter to you. In both of them I've tried to stir you up and remind you to think clearly with pure minds.  	Pegih neh, ni‑wepnag, id o d waꞌi gokkokam mant am i em‑oꞌohanid k am i em‑chegitol idam haꞌichu.  
2PE03:2	Remember the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets, and what the Lord and Savior commanded through your apostles.  	Chum ani si em‑tatchuid mamt wo s‑chegitok g haꞌichu ha‑ahga g Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam ch ep wo s‑chegitok hegai chehanigaj g t‑doꞌibiakam kownal Jesus mo g am chuhchaij am wa em‑ahgid. 
2PE03:3	Above all you should know that derisive people will come in the last days, full of mockery and following their own evil desires.  	Mt wo s‑mahchkad mat am wo i e aihi mat ep wo jiwia g Jesus, t an haꞌi wo i wuwha mo heg waꞌi hejel e‑tatchui am hab s‑junimk. Idam at wo has em‑ahgad  
2PE03:4	“So what happened to this coming he promised?” they ask. “Right from the time our ancestors died, everything's continued as it always has, ever since creation began.”  	ch pi ab hu has wo elidad g wohokam ch hab wo kaijjid, “Mki wabsh hejel e iattogid mam hab chechꞌe matsh ep wo uhpam jiwia g Jesus. T eda pi jiwia. T muꞌijj heki hu waꞌi koi g t‑shohshon. Wehs haꞌichu o am hab wabsh i e junihim mo has i e junihim ga hu hebai i amjed mashp hekid in i e nahto g jewed.”  
2PE03:5	But they deliberately ignore the fact that by God's command the heavens were created long ago. The earth came into existence from the water, and was surrounded by water.  	Idam o hab s‑e junimk mo pi mahch mo id d wohokam matsh wa g Jiosh am neok k am nahto g dahm kahchim ch jewed. Ihda jewed atsh ab i wuhsh shuhdagi t amjed k g shuhdagikaj e nahto.  
2PE03:6	It was through water that the world that then existed was destroyed—through being flooded by water.  	K am i himdam, sh d wa ep shuhdagi mat ha wiꞌin k ha hugio g hemajkam.  
2PE03:7	But by means of that same divine command the heavens and the earth that now exist are reserved for destruction by fire at the day of judgment when the wicked will be destroyed. 	K hab wa masma wabsh g e‑neꞌokikaj an uꞌukch g Jiosh g dahm kahchim ch jewed ch ab wo ai mat wo ha lodai g pi ap hemajkam k im hu hab wo i ha juh mei ch ed. 
2PE03:8	However, my friends, don't forget this one thing: that for the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years is like a day.  	Id amt ep wo s‑chegitok mo g mihl aꞌahidag hab waꞌi masma mo g hemako tash am wehhejed g Jiosh.  
2PE03:9	The Lord is not delaying the fulfillment of his promise, as some define delay, but he is being very patient with you. He doesn't want anyone to be lost, but everyone to come and repent. 	K wabshaba am hemajkam t‑wehhejed shahag wepo mo si chewaj g tash mat g Jiosh am hab wo juh hegai mash hab s‑t‑junidamk. K eda g Jiosh si s‑ha bahbgi g hemajkam ch ab chum ha nenida no pi pi hab chum shaꞌi elid mas hedai wo huhug am pi apꞌekam ch e d pi gam hu s‑ohhodk g pi ap e‑chegitoi. 
2PE03:10	However the day of the Lord will come, unexpectedly like a thief. The heavens will explode with a thunderous roar, and the elements  will be destroyed as they are burned up. The earth and everything in it will vanish.  	Neh, no hig pi woho mo pi ta machima mas hekid g s‑chu ehskam am wo wah em‑kih ed? Pegih, k hab waꞌap pi ta machima mas hekid ep wo jiwia g t‑kownalig Jesus. S‑hohtam atsh wo jiwia. Kutsh wo si s‑kaidam huhug g dahm kahchim k wo meitto g tash ch huhuꞌu ch jewed.  
2PE03:11	Since everything is going to be destroyed in this way, what kind of people should you be? You should be living lives that are pure, dedicated to God,  	Wehs haꞌichu atsh wo huhug. Mt heg hekaj ab wo chum si i e dagitokch Jiosh wui  
2PE03:12	waiting expectantly and being eager for the coming of the day of God. That day the heavens will catch fire and be destroyed, and the elements will melt in the heat.  	ch ab wo nenidad hegai tash ch am wo e nakogad mat hems s‑hohtam wo e ai. 
2PE03:13	But as for us, we are looking for new heavens and a new earth that God has promised where everything is right. 	Sh wabshaba g Jiosh hab kaij mat heg i dahm am haha wo nahto g wechij dahm kahchim ch wechij jewed. Tsh g s‑apꞌekam an hab wo waꞌi e junihid anai. Neh, id ach ab si nenida. 
2PE03:14	So, my friends, since you're anticipating these things, make sure you'll be found pure and blameless, and at peace with God.  	Pegih oi g wo, tt hig am wo si i t‑nako matt wo si s‑apꞌek am Jiosh tahgio k wo si s‑ap t‑tahtkkad ab aꞌai t‑wui. T g Jiosh s‑ap ab wo t‑neidad.  
2PE03:15	Remember that it is our Lord's patience that gives the opportunity for salvation. That's what our dear brother Paul was explaining to you in all his letters with the wisdom given to him by God.  	Am g wo s‑amichudad mo g Jiosh am wabsh s‑t‑bahbgi mattp hems wehsijj wo t‑doꞌibia. Paul at wa am hab waꞌap em‑oꞌohani ihda heg hekaj amichudadag mo g Jiosh ab mahkch.  
2PE03:16	He spoke about these things, though some of what he wrote is certainly hard to understand. Some ignorant and unbalanced people have twisted what he wrote to their own loss—just as they do other scriptures.  	Bo wa masma hab chuꞌig wehs oꞌohanaj ed mo am ha oꞌohanid g aꞌai hemajkam id amjed. Hahasko o s‑hasigam hab kaidag g oꞌohanaj.

T im hu hab wo i ha juh g Jiosh. 
2PE03:17	My friends, since you already know this, make sure that these errors of the wicked don't lead you astray, and you don't fall from your firm position.  	Am am wa heki hu s‑mahch wehs ihda, ni‑wepnag. Hegam mat pi ab hu wo wohog elidad g Jiosh at gam hu hab wo i e juh ab amjed. Kumt wo s‑e nenꞌoidad mamt pi am hu ha oidk hab wo e junihid.

2TH01:3	We keep on thanking God for you, brothers and sisters—we just have to! This is the right thing to do because your trust in God is growing in leaps and bounds, and the love you all have for each other increases more and more. 	Chum ach hekid ab si hoꞌigeꞌid g Jiosh em-hekaj, t-wepnag. Am amsh si i gewkahim e-wohochudadag ed ch baꞌich i si pihk e elid ab aꞌai e wui.

2TH01:5	For this is evidence that God is right in the decisions he makes, and that you deserve the kingdom of God for which you are suffering.  	Id o am wohokamchud mat am i em-apꞌech g Jiosh e wehhejed k pi ab hu haꞌichu wo em-abch am lodaita ch ed. Am am e shoꞌigchud wehhejed g Jiosh kownaltalig.

2TH01:7	He will free you from your suffering—and us too—when the Lord Jesus appears from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels,  	Kumt ahpim wo e doꞌibia ab amjed g e-shoꞌigchudadag. Jiosh at hab wo juh ihda mat hekid ep wo jiwia g t-kownalig Jesus ab dahm kahchim t amjed. T ia wehmaj wo dada g anghiligaj k wo si s-gewkdagk.

Id at hab wo e juh mat hekid ia ep wo jiwia g t-kownalig Jesus. Kut g gewkdaj am haha wo i chehgi mat t-doꞌibia k ab i t-gawulkai e wehhejed. 
2TH01:11	That's why we continue to pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of what he's called us to do. May God powerfully fulfill every desire you have to do good and every action that comes from trusting him  	Pegih, heg ach hekaj chum hekid ab t-hoꞌigeꞌidahun Jiosh wui am em-wehhejed.

2TH02:1	Talking about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and how we're brought together to him, brother and sisters—  	Bach wa em-ahgid mat ep wo jiwia g t-kownalig Jesus Christ k ab e wui wo i t-ui.  
2TH02:2	please don't become upset or concerned by any spiritual revelation, or message, or letter supposedly from us that makes you think that the day of the Lord has already come.  	Kush am hema em-ahgid mat heki hu hab e juh. Pi g am wo shaꞌi e kudut k pi shaꞌi ha wohochud, chum as hems hab wabsh e wua mo heg am ha tashogid g Jiosh o atp hems em-ahgid matt ahchim hab masma haꞌichu oꞌoha.  
2TH02:3-4	Don't let anyone deceive you in any way, because the Rebellion must come first, and the lawless man be revealed, the one whose end is destruction.  He is the enemy of God, and proudly sets himself up over everything that is called God and is worshiped. He even installs himself in God's Temple, claiming to be God.  	Koi at e ai. Hemho wa at wehpeg am hab wo e juh mat muꞌi ab wui wo gegokiwua g Jiosh hegam mo hab chum kaij mo ab s-wohochud.

2TH02:5	Don't you remember that I told you all this while I was still with you? 	Am am wa s-chegito mani wa am wa heki hu em-ahgid ihda mani eda am em-wehmaj.  
2TH02:6-7	Now you know what's keeping him in check, because he will be revealed for what he is at the appropriate time.  For the secret ways of lawlessness  are already at work; however he who now restrains it will continue to do so until he is out of the way.  	S-mahch am mo g pi apꞌekam an e shohbidch hemu. T wabshaba has tash in hu hab wo i e juh hegai mo an shohbidch.  
2TH02:8-11	Then the lawless one will be revealed, the one whom the Lord Jesus will wipe out, blowing him away,  destroying him by the brilliance of his coming.  He (the lawless one) comes to do Satan's work, having all kinds of powers, using miracles, and performing amazing but deceptive displays.  Using every type of evil trick he deludes those who are on their way to destruction, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.  Because of this God sends them a convincing delusion so that they put their trust in the lie. 	T am haha wo i wuhsh hegai si pi apꞌekam oꞌodham. T g jijawul ha-geꞌejig Satan ab wo mah g gewkdag. Kut hab wo juh g nahnko mahs s-hasig haꞌichu ch s-ta neidamam haꞌichu mat wo ha iattogi g hemajkam. Kut hegam ab wo i s-wohoch mo hedai d pi e doꞌibiakam.

2TH02:12	As a result everyone who did not trust in the truth will be condemned, for they preferred what is evil. 	T hegam mo e iattogid ch ab s-wohochud hab waꞌap ab wo bei g s-koꞌok e-namkidadag. 
2TH02:13-14	But we just have to keep on thanking God for you, brothers and sisters loved by the Lord, because God from the beginning chose you to be saved through the Spirit who makes you right as you trust in the truth.  This is what he called you to through the good news we shared with you, so that you could participate in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.  	Mt wabshaba ahpim wo e doꞌibia ab amjed g s-koꞌok e-namkidadag. Si o pihk e elid g t-kownalig Jesus Christ em-hekaj. Kumt am wehmaj ab wo e haꞌichuchudad.

Id ach hekaj ab i hoꞌigeꞌid g Jiosh.  
2TH02:15	So, brothers and sisters, stand firm, and hold on to what you've been taught, whether by what you were told, or through a letter from us.  	Pegih, am ach wa em-mashcham ihda wohokam ch am ep em-oꞌohanid ab amjed. Kumt s-wihnam wo gegokkad ch an wo uꞌukchid. 
2TH02:16	Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God the Father (who through his grace gave us eternal confidence and a trustworthy hope),  	Ab o t-wui si pihk e elid g t-kownalig Jesus Christ g Jiosh t-ohg wehm ch ab si s-t-hoꞌigeꞌel. Kuch heg hekaj ab wui t-gewpkadch.

2TH03:1	Lastly, brothers and sisters, please pray for us, so that the Lord's message may spread and be truly appreciated, just as it is by you—  	Ab g wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahun, t-wepnag, k ab wo tai g Jiosh mat pi ab hu wo e shohbi g haꞌichu t-ahga ab amjed t-kownalig Jesus. T muꞌijj ab wo si has i elid k ab wo s-wohog el hab masma mo am hab e wua em-shahgid.  
2TH03:2	and that we may be kept safe from immoral and evil men, because not everyone trusts in God.  	Pi ap hehemajkam o pi ab hu wohochud g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch ab t-wui gegok. Kumt am wo si e hoꞌigeꞌidahunad mat wo t-doꞌibia g Jiosh ab ha amjed. 
2TH03:3	But the Lord is trustworthy and will strengthen you, and protect you from the Evil One.  	Jiosh at hemho wa am hab wo juh mo haschu i t-ahgid. S-mahch ach mat ab wo i em-mah g gewkdag k wo em-nuhkud mat pi wo em-gehg g Jiawul.

2TH03:5	May the Lord lead you into a deeper understanding of God's love for you and the endurance of Christ. 	Ch ab i tahni g t-kownalig Jesus mat hab wo em-juh mamt baꞌich wo i mai g Jiosh pihk elidadag k wo s-chu nakogad hab masma mo hab masma g Jesus Christ. 
2TH03:6	Now we want to tell you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, not to associate with any believer who can't be bothered to work for their living—those who don't follow the teachings they learned from us.  	Heki ach hu em-mashcham mamt wo s-wapagimak. K eda haꞌi hegam mo d wohochuddam s-papadma ch pi am hu oidch hab e junihim g t-mashchama. Ch ab em-chehani g t-kownalig Jesus Christ gewkdagkaj mamt pi am hu wo ha wehmajk.

2TH03:8	—we didn't eat anyone's food without paying for it. Instead we worked hard day and night so we wouldn't be a burden to any of you.  	Si ach wa chikpan chum hems s-chuhugam k ed matt am wo wa haꞌichu ha namkidad hegam mach hedai i kih am dadha mamt pi haꞌichu wo heki gei t-wehhejed. 
2TH03:9	Not that we don't have the right to do so—but we wanted to be an example to you, so that you could copy what we did.

2TH03:12	We're ordering such people, urging them in the Lord Jesus, to settle down and work to pay for their own food. 	Ch ab si ha chehani g t-kownalig Jesus Christ gewkdagkaj ch ab ha gewkemhun mat am wabsh wo i e bahbgi k wo chikpanad ch hekaj wo e dagioꞌidad.

2TI01:10	He gave this grace to us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time, and is now revealed in the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus. He destroyed death, making life and immortality brilliantly clear through the good news.  	Ia at jiwia g t-doꞌibiakam Jesus Christ k am i t-tashogi g Jiosh hoꞌigeꞌidadag.

2TI01:12	That's also the reason I'm suffering all this, but I'm not ashamed, because I know whom I've trusted.

2TI01:16-17	May the Lord be kind to the family of Onesiphorus, because he often took care of me and wasn't embarrassed about me being in prison.  When he was in Rome, he took the trouble to search for me, and he found me.

2TI02:8	Focus your mind on Jesus Christ, a descendant of David, who was raised from the dead. This is my good news,  	Jesus Christ o hab waꞌap d oꞌodham ch ab s-ap nakog g shoꞌigdag. T g Jiosh ab uhpam i wuhshad heg i dahm mat muh. Do ihda s-kehg haꞌichu ahga mani am ahgachug. Kupt am wo oidahid mat haschu ab nako g Christ ch s-ap ab wo nako g e-shoꞌigdag.

2TI02:11	This is a trustworthy saying: “If we died with him, we will also live with him;  	Do si wohokam ihda hab ha-cheꞌi: 
2TI02:14	This is what you should remind people about, telling them before God that they shouldn't have meaningless arguments over words. To do this only harms those who listen. 	Am g i ha chegitochud ihda mani wa m-ahgid k ab ha shohbid g Jiosh gewkdagkaj mat pi wabsh pehegi wo neneokad ch pi wo e cheggiad. Id at wo ha padch hegam mat wo kaiha.  
2TI02:15	Make sure you work hard so you can present yourself to God and gain his approval. Be a worker that doesn't need to be embarrassed, using the word of truth correctly.  	Am g si i e nakog mapt d wo si s-ap piongajk g Jiosh ch si s-ap am wo ha mashchamad g Jiosh wohokam mapt pi wo shaꞌi si e elidad. 
2TI02:16-18	Avoid pointless chatter because people who do this are heading away from God.  Their teachings are as destructive as gangrene that destroys healthy flesh. Hymenaeus and Philetus are like this.  They have deviated from the truth by saying that the resurrection has already happened, which has ruined some people's trust in God. 	Haꞌi at dagito g wohokam k ha mashcham mat heki hu ab i wuwha g koꞌi muhkig amjed. Gohkajj idam mo id hekaj ha iattogid o d Hymanaeus ch Phyletus.

2TI02:19	But God's solid, trustworthy foundation stone stands firm, with this inscription, “The Lord knows those who belong to him,” and “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord should stay away from all that is evil.”  	T wabshaba g Jiosh s-wihnam shondad g e-neꞌoki mat pi hedai wo shaꞌi gawul juh. K an oꞌohanas: 
2TI02:20	A stately home doesn't just have cups and bowls made of gold and silver. It also has ones made from wood and clay. Some are made for special use; others for more commonplace functions.  	Neh, matp hems am wo haꞌichugk g nahnko mahs hohashahaꞌa am s‑kais kih ed. Tp hems haꞌi d wo ohlak ch haꞌi d wo plahtak ch haꞌi d wo uhsk ch haꞌi d wo bidk. Kut wo e hekaj hegam mo s‑namkig ha wehhejed g s‑has hahaꞌichu. T g pi namkigchu wabsh chum has masma wo e hekaj.  
2TI02:21	So if you get rid of what is evil, you will become a cup or bowl that is holy and special, useful to the Lord, ready to do all that's good.

2TI02:22	Run away from anything that fires up the desires of youth. Run after what is right and trustworthy, run after love and peace along with those who are true and pure Christians.  	Pegih, pi g am i e dagito pi apꞌekam ch ed k am s‑ap wo i e gewkadch s‑apꞌekam k ed ch am hab wo junihid mapt haschu wo ha ahgi ch wo si pihk e elidad wehs ha hekaj ch wo si s‑ap e tahtkkad ab ha wui g e‑wehm wohochuddam.

2TI03:1	Be aware that there will be troubled times in the last days.  	Si g s‑chegitok mat wehs haꞌichu wo s‑hasigk mat d wo i ha oidch tatshk.  
2TI03:2	People will love themselves and love money. They will be boastful, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, and without God in their lives.

Muꞌi at wo s‑ohhodad g s‑apꞌekam.

2TI03:8	Just like Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, these teachers also oppose the truth. They are people with corrupted minds whose supposed trust in God is a lie.

You know what I've had to endure—  	P wabshaba ahpi hig am oid g haꞌichu ni‑mashchama ch haꞌichu hab ni‑juni ch haꞌichu hab ni‑elida.

2TI04:3	For the time is coming when people won't bother to listen to true teaching. Instead they will be curious to listen to something different, and will surround themselves with teachers who'll tell them what they want to hear.  	Ab o him g tash mat wo i muꞌida hegam mat gawul haꞌichu wo ha mashcha. Kut muꞌi hemajkam ab wo s‑ha kaim

And not just to me, but to everyone who longs for his coming. 	K heg am waꞌi wiꞌis mant wo bei g s‑apꞌekam ni‑gehgewi nani pi g s‑apꞌekam am hab junihim.

Kutsh si has i el g hemajkam am i neidok mo d hegai pi himidkam mo ab dahiwup kolhai kihjego.

ACT03:13-16	The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—the God of our forefathers—has glorified his servant Jesus. He was the one you betrayed and rejected in the presence of Pilate, even after Pilate had decided to release him.  You rejected the One who is Holy and Right, and demanded a murderer be released to you.  You killed the Author of life, the one God raised from the dead—and we are witnesses to this.  By trusting in Jesus' name this man was healed by him. You see this man here; you know him. Through trusting in Jesus this man has received complete healing right in front of all of you.

ACT04:9	Are we being interrogated regarding a good deed done to a man who couldn't help himself, and how he came to be healed?  	matt hemho wo wa bei g apꞌedag matt hab wo juh g s‑apꞌekam.  
ACT04:10	If so, all of you should know, and all the people of Israel, that it was in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, the one you killed on a cross and whom God raised from the dead—it's because of him that this man stands before you completely healed.  	Pegih, nt wo em‑ahgi mat g Jesus Christ ab i t‑mah hegai gewkdag matt hekaj doaj ihda oꞌodham. Ahpim amt hab juh hegai Jesus Christ mat ab e naggia kots t ab.

ACT04:13	When they saw Peter and John's confidence, and realized they were uneducated, ordinary men, they were very surprised. They also recognized them as Jesus' companions.

ACT04:16	“What should we do with these men?” they asked. “We can't deny a significant miracle has happened through them. Everybody living here in Jerusalem knows about it.  	Kush hab kaij, “Shahtt wo ha juh. Wehsijj o s‑mahch g Jerusalem t am kihkam mat doaj g pi himidkam. K id d si s‑hasig haꞌichu. Kutt pi wo shaꞌi t‑nako machs hab wo chei mas pi woho hab juh.” 
ACT04:17	But to prevent it spreading among the people any further, we should threaten them never to speak to anybody in this name again.” 	Sh hab hahawa ep kaij, “Matt wo keshwua ihda ha‑ahga mat pi hekid am hu ep wo shaꞌi aꞌagad ihda Jesus am hema i wui.” 
ACT04:18	So they called them back in and ordered them never to speak or teach in the name of Jesus again.  	Kumtsh ab hahawa ep i ha wahpki. Sh hab ha ahg, “Chum as has wo chuꞌigk haꞌichu, mt pi am hu wo shaꞌi aꞌagad ihda Jesus.” 
ACT04:19	But Peter and John responded, “Whether it's right in God's eyes to obey you rather than God—you decide.  	Sh hab hahawa si kaij hegam Peter, “Am g wo i aꞌamichud machs ahpim ab wo em‑wohoch aha natt g Jiosh.

ACT04:21-22	After making more threats they let them go. They couldn't work out how to punish them because everyone was glorifying God for what had happened.  For the man who received this miracle of healing was more than forty years old.  	Kush wa eda hegai pi himidkam i baꞌiwchkim g giꞌikko wehst‑mahm aꞌahidag.

ACT04:27	Now this has really happened right here in this city! Both Herod and Pontius Pilate, together with the foreigners and the people of Israel, united together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed as Messiah.  	“Neh, Jiosh t‑ohg, t wa woho am e hemapai g t‑wehm oꞌodham ha wehm g gawul mahs hemajkam ch hegam kokownal mo d Herod ch Pilate.

ACT04:31	When they had finished praying, the building they were meeting in was shaken. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God boldly.  	Tsh am i haꞌasa e hoꞌigeꞌidahu. Tsh g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag am si uꞌugij hegai kih mo am e hemapadch k ab si i ha mah g gewkdag. Tsh am hahawa baꞌich i si s‑gewkam ah g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.

Sh hab kaij g Peter ab wui, “Shahchu apt ahgk hiwigi g Jiawul mat am pad haꞌichu hab juh m‑ihbdag ed.

ACT05:4	While you had the land, didn't it belong to you? And after you sold it, didn't you still have control over what you did with the money? Why did you decide to do this? You haven't lied to human beings, but to God!” 	Hegai haꞌichu m‑eniga o d m‑eniga mapt koi gagda. Pt am i gagda. K hegai namkigaj d m‑lialiga. Pt eda hab juh ihda si geꞌe pi apꞌekam.

ACT05:9	Then Peter told her, “How could you agree together to swindle the Spirit of the Lord? Look, those who buried your husband are just returning, and they'll carry you out too!” 	Sh hab kaij g Peter, “Ms haschu ahgk hig ahpi g e‑wehm kihkam wehm hab chum i e taht mamt wabsh wo piꞌich g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag?

ACT05:12	Many miraculous signs were performed among the people by the apostles. All the believers used to meet together in Solomon's porch.  	Kush s‑hasig haꞌichu s‑ta neidamam hab junihim g Jesus chuhchai am ha shahgid g hemajkam. Sh wehsijj si s‑ap e hehemapad hegam Jesus ihmdam heg wecho Solomonbad watto.

ACT05:18	They arrested the apostles and threw them in the public jail.  	k am i ha cheha g geꞌe cheopi nuhkuddam mat wo ha kuh. Tsh wa woho am ha kuh.

ACT05:23	“We found the prison all locked up, with guards at the doors. But when we had them open up, we couldn't find anyone inside.” 	“M att dada kukpaikud am k am chum nei. K ab wabsh kia yahwidag. K g lilso ha nuhkuddam ab ep gegok kihjeg t ab. Tt wabshaba am i chum kuhpiꞌo g kihjeg. K pi am hu hedai haꞌichug.”

ACT05:26	So the captain went with his guards and brought them in, but did not use force because they were afraid that the people would stone them.  	Tsh am hahawa hihi g geꞌe cheopi nuhkuddam k ab uhpam wabsh s‑ap i ha ui nat pi am hu wo ha maꞌichshul g hemajkam  
ACT05:27	The apostles were brought in and made to stand in front of the council. 	k am ha uꞌapa ha wui g e jehnigiddam. 
ACT05:28	“Didn't we order you not to teach in this name?” the high priest demanded to know. “Now look—you've filled the whole of Jerusalem with your teaching, and you're trying to blame us for his death!” 	“Chum ach s‑gewkam pi em‑hiwgid mams an hu wo aꞌagad hegai Jesusbad. T eda g em‑mashchamadag ab amjed heki hu wehsko chehmo g Jerusalem. Kum ahpim ab chum t‑abchud g muhkigaj.” 
ACT05:29-32	But Peter and the apostles answered, “We have to obey God rather than men.  The God of our forefathers raised Jesus from the dead—the one you killed by hanging him on a cross.  God exalted him to a position of honor at his right hand as Prince and Savior, as a way to bring repentance to Israel, and for the forgiveness of sins.  We are witnesses of what happened, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.” 	Sh hab kaij hegam Peter, “K wabshaba g Jiosh am t‑ahgid matt am wo wa ahgahid ihda mach haschu i si t‑wuhpuikaj neid.

ACT05:33	When the council heard this they were furious and wanted to kill them.  	Tsh wabsh wohoꞌi babgat hegam e jehnigiddam k wabsh chum s‑ha kokdaimk.  
ACT05:34	But then one of the council members stood up to speak. He was Gamaliel, a Pharisee and a doctor of law who was respected by everyone. He ordered the apostles sent out for a short while.

ACT05:38	So in the current case I recommend that you leave these men alone, and just let them go. If what they are planning or what they are doing comes from their own human thinking, then it will be defeated.  	“Pegih, k hemuch hab wa mahs haꞌichu. Pi g am hu has wo shaꞌi ha juhni idam oꞌodham.

ACT05:39	But if it comes from God, you won't be able to defeat them. You could even find yourselves fighting against God!” 	Mtp hems heg wabsh wo e wepogi mam g Jiosh wabsh cheggia.” 
ACT05:40	They were convinced by what he said. So they called the apostles back in, had them whipped, and ordered them not to say anything in the name of Jesus. Then they let them go.  	k hab ha ahg g geꞌe cheopi nuhkuddam mat am wo i ha wahpki g lilso k wo ha gewitta. Tsh wa woho hab e juh.

ACT06:1	At this time, when the number of believers was increasing rapidly, the Greek-speaking believers started arguing with the Aramaic-speaking believers. They complained that their widows were being discriminated against in the daily distribution of food. 	Kush am i muꞌidahim hegam mash am oid g Jesus himdag.

ACT06:2	The twelve apostles called all the believers together, and told them, “It's not appropriate for us to give up spreading the word of God so we can wait at tables.

ACT06:5	Everybody was happy with the arrangement, and they chose Stephen, (a man full of trust in God and of the Holy Spirit), Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus (originally a Jewish convert from Antioch).  	Kumtsh ab si i s‑hohhoꞌi mo has kaij k am wewaꞌak i ha chuhcha. Hema idam ash hab chehgig Steven ch ab si s‑gewkam hiwig g Jesus. Sh g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ab si mahkch g gewkdag.

ACT06:7	The word of God continued to spread, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem greatly increased, with a large number of priests committing themselves to trusting in Jesus.

ACT06:9	But some started arguing with him. They were from the synagogue called “the Free,” as well as Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and people from Cilicia and Asia Minor.

ACT06:12	They stirred up the people, and together with the elders and the teachers of the law, they came and arrested him. They brought him before the council,  	Kush wa woho hab kaij idam ch hekaj i ha kudu g hemajkam ch geꞌeged ch chehanig ha mashchamdam. Tsh idam wabsh woho i babgat k am hihim k an bei g Steven k ged hu uꞌapa ha wui g e jehnigiddam.

ACT07:2	“Brothers and fathers, listen to me!” Stephen replied. “God in his glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was living in Mesopotamia, before he moved to Haran. 	Kush hab kaij g Steven: 
ACT07:3	God told him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and go to the country that I'm going to show you.’  	“Sh hab kaij g Jiosh ab wui: 
ACT07:4	So he left the country of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. After his father's death, God sent him here to this country where you now live.  	“Tsh wa woho am dagito g Mesopotamia jewed mash am kih g Caldea hemajkam k am chihpia Haran kihhim wui. Kutsh am i muh g Abrahambad ohgbad. Tsh ab hahawa ep cheha g Jiosh mat ia wo chihpia Canaan jewed wui. Kutsh ia i chiwia mach hemuch ia kih.  
ACT07:5	God didn't give Abraham an inheritance here, not even one square foot. But God did promise Abraham that he would give him and his descendants possession of the land, even though he had no children.

ACT07:6	God also told him that his descendants would live in a foreign country, and that they would be enslaved there, and would be mistreated for four hundred years.  	“Kush hab kaij g Jiosh ab wui: 
ACT07:9	The patriarchs, who were jealous of Joseph, sold him into slavery in Egypt. But God was with him,  	“Tsh idam wa s‑hehgam g e‑wehnag Josephbad k ab haꞌi ha wui gagda mat d wo ha neholigak am Egypt jewed ch ed. Sh wabshaba g Jiosh am nuhkud

ACT07:11	Now a famine occurred throughout Egypt and Canaan. It caused terrible misery, and our forefathers had no food.  	“Tsh wa haha wabsh gei g bihugig k ha shoꞌigch g hemajkam wehsko Egypt jewed dahm ch iia Canaan jewed dahm. Tsh pi shaꞌi e amich hegam Abrahambad mat hebai wo bei g haꞌichu hugi.

Tsh g Josephbad am hahawa ha ahgi mo d ha‑wehnag nash pi pi amichud. Tsh g ha‑kownalig g Egypt t am hemajkam ab s‑ha mai g Josephbad hajuni.

ACT07:17	As the time approached regarding the promise that God had made to Abraham, the number of our people in Egypt increased.  	“Sh amjed muꞌi aꞌahidag wehgaj. Sh e aihim matsh am hab wo juh g Jiosh mash haschu i heki hu ahgid g Abrahambad. Tsh eda am i si muꞌida g t‑shohshonbad amai Egypt ch ed.

Tsh ab si i mai ihda wehs k d si s‑has haꞌichu am heg eda mo haschu hab i kaij ch haschu hab i junihim.

ACT07:24	He saw one of them being mistreated, so he intervened to defend him. On behalf of the man he took revenge and killed the Egyptian.  	Kush hema g Egypt t am oꞌodham am hema shoꞌigchud g Tuhligo. Tsh g Mosesbad am i wehmt g e‑hajuni k mua ihda Egypt t am oꞌodham mat wo agwua

You are brothers!’ he told them. ‘Why are you attacking each other?’ 	Sh am baꞌich d i tash, sh am haꞌi e cheggia g Tutuligo. Tsh am ha neid k chum s‑ha daꞌid k hab kaij, ‘Kia, ahpim!

ACT07:27	But the man who had started the fight pushed Moses away. ‘Who put you in charge over us? Are you our judge now?’ he asked.  	“Kut hegai mo ha cheggia ab si nuꞌichkwua g Mosesbad k hab kaij: 
ACT07:29	When he heard this, Moses ran away. He went and lived in exile in the land of Midian, where two sons were born to him. 	“Tsh am i kah g Mosesbad ihda k ha hekaj gam hu i e mehkod ab Egypt amjed k gam hu i jiwia mash am d Midian jewed. Sh am haꞌi oꞌodhamag. Kutsh am ha hohnt k gohk chechoj aꞌalidt 
ACT07:30	Forty years later, in the desert of Mount Sinai, an angel appeared to him in the flames of a burning bush.  	“Sh am him k am d i giꞌikko wehst‑mahm aꞌahidag.

ACT07:31	When Moses saw this, he was amazed at the sight, and went over to take a closer look. The voice of the Lord spoke to him:  	Tsh ab i miabi g Mosesbad mat ab si s‑ap wo i nei nash pi pi amichud matsh wa pi shaꞌi meitto g shaꞌi. Sh g Jiosh ab wui hab kaij am gahi wuhshanim g anghil: 
ACT07:33	The Lord told him, ‘Take off your sandals, because where you are standing is holy ground.  	“Sh hab ep kaij g Jiosh ab wui: 
ACT07:35	This was the same Moses that the people had rejected when they said, ‘Who made you a ruler and judge over us?’ God sent him to be both a ruler and a liberator, by means of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.  	Kuni hab ep s‑cheꞌimk mo ihda Mosesbad d hegai matsh wa g hajunij pi ab hu tatchua ch hab kaij: 
ACT07:37	This is the same Moses who promised the Israelites, ‘God will send you a prophet like me from among your people.’  	ch am ha ahgid ch hab kaij:

ACT07:41	Then they made an idol in the shape of a calf, sacrificed to it, and celebrated what they themselves had made! 	“Kush wa am hema wisilot g ohlakaj k ab wui iagchul heg wepogidch mo d ha‑jioshga k am ep piast mat heg hekaj ab wo si i haꞌichuch hegai e‑jioshta.  
ACT07:42	So God gave up on them. He left them to their worship of the stars in the sky. This is what the prophets wrote, ‘Were you giving offerings or making sacrifices to me during the forty years in the desert, you Israelites?  	Kutsh heg hekaj im hu hab i e juh g Jiosh ab ha amjed k am wabsh ha hiwigi mat wabsh g hejel hab e‑elida am hab wo junihid.

God had told Moses how he should make it following the blueprint he had seen.  	“Kuni hab ep s‑cheꞌimk mash hegam an uꞌahim hegai cheopi mash heg hekaj am ha tashogid g Jiosh mash am ha wehmaj. Sh heg d wabsh hogi ch hab masma e nahto matsh wa g Jiosh am chehgi g Mosesbad.  
ACT07:45	Later on, our forefathers carried it with them when they went in with Joshua to occupy the land taken from the nations the Lord drove out before them. It stayed there until the time of David.  	Sh g ha‑amjedkam an ep uꞌahim hegai cheopi matsh hekid g Joshuabad am i e kei matsh wo i ha wanim.

ACT07:48	Of course the Almighty doesn't live in temples we make. As the prophet said,  	“K eda g Jiosh baꞌich i geꞌej mo haschu i mo an hab chuꞌig t‑wehgaj. T pi wo shaꞌi e nako g oꞌodham mas wo kihch. Batsh wa masma an oꞌoha g kelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam mash hab kaij g Jiosh: 
ACT07:51-52	You arrogant, hard-hearted people! You never listen! You always fight against the Holy Spirit! You act just like your fathers did!  Was there ever a prophet your fathers didn't persecute? They killed those who prophesied about the coming of the One who is truly good and right. He is the One you betrayed and murdered—  	“Kush wabshaba g t‑shohshonbad si e sheshemachud ch pi chechkaidag ch pi ab hu kaiham g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.

He claimed that he was someone very important, and had astounded the people of Samaria  	Sh am hema kih g oꞌodham mash hab chehgig Simon ch heki hu waꞌi amjed am hab junihim g s‑hasigam haꞌichu ch hab chum e wua mo d ge mahkai.

ACT09:17	So Ananias left and went to the house. He placed his hands on Saul. “Brother Saul,” he said, “The Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were traveling here, has sent me so you can regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”  	Tsh wa woho am hih g Ananias heg wui kih k ab si i s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌel g kihkam.

ACT09:21	All who heard him were amazed, and asked, “Isn't this the man who caused so much trouble in Jerusalem for those who believed in Jesus?

ACT10:23	So he invited them in and they stayed there. 	Tsh ab i ha wahpki g Peter idam waik oꞌodham mat am wo waꞌi kohk. 
ACT10:24	The following day they arrived in Caesarea where Cornelius was waiting for them with his relatives and close friends whom he'd called together.  	Am baꞌich d ep i tash. Tsh ged hu hahawa dada Cesaria t am.

ACT10:27	Peter spoke with Cornelius, and then went on in where he found many other people waiting for him.  	Kush am e wehm neneokhim ch am i wahp. Sh am muꞌi dadha g hemajkam. 
ACT10:28	He said to them, “You certainly know that it's not permitted for a Jew to be associated with or to visit foreigners. But God has shown me that it's not for me to call anyone impure or unclean.  	Kush am ha neid g Peter ch hab kaij ab ha wui, “Am am wa s‑mahch mach ahchim Tutuligo pi shaꞌi hiwgidas ab t‑himdag amjed machs ab wo i s‑em‑hajunima ahpim mam d gawul mahs hemajkam, niꞌichs am hu wo em‑chehgim em‑kihki wui.

ACT10:30	“Four days ago, at about this time—three in the afternoon—I was praying in my house,” Cornelius explained. “Suddenly I saw a man standing in front of me, dressed in clothes that shone brightly.  	Sh hab kaij g Cornelius, “Am ani ni‑hoꞌigeꞌidahun ni‑kih am d hu hema i tako imhab i juhk. T am haha wabsh hema jiwia g oꞌodham. K si tonod g wehschugaj. K ab kehk ni‑wui

ACT10:33	So immediately I sent for you, and it was good of you to come. That's why we're all here, meeting together before God, ready to hear everything the Lord has told you.” 	“Kunt am hahawa haꞌi ha cheha mat am hihim k ab i m‑wai. Kupt s‑ap e juh k ab i hih.

ACT10:37-38	You know that this good news spread throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee, following John's call to baptism.  It's about Jesus of Nazareth—how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, and how he went around doing good, healing all those who were under the devil's control, for God was with him.

ACT10:45-46	The Jewish believers who had come with Peter were astonished, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the foreigners.  They heard them speaking in tongues, glorifying God.  	Tsh am gawul neꞌokikaj neneo mat pi hebai mai k ab si ihm g Jiosh. Tsh am i ha kaiok ab si e totods hegam mo wehmaj g Peter natki pi g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ab si i ha mah g gewkdag hegam gawul mahs hemajkam. 
ACT10:47	Then Peter asked, “Is anybody going to prevent them being baptized in water, since they have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?”  	Sh ab kaij g Peter, “Jiosh atki ab i ha mah g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag mat hab masma ab i t‑mah. No hig pi d ha wuikam mat wo e pahl wapko?”  
ACT10:48	He gave orders for them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they pleaded with him to spend some time with them. 	Kumtsh wa woho ha pahl wapko am chehchegch g Jesus Christ. 
ACT11:1	The apostles and brothers in Judea heard that foreigners had also accepted the word of God.  	Tsh am i kah g Jesus wohochuddam amai Judea jewed t am matsh hegam gawul mahs hemajkam ab bei ihda Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.  
ACT11:2	When Peter arrived back in Jerusalem, those who believed circumcision was still essential argued with him.

ACT11:4	Peter began to explain to them everything that had happened.  	Tsh am hahawa ha ahgi g Peter matsh haschu has e juh gd hu i shonchudk mo wa am e hoꞌigeꞌidahun Joppa kihhim t am ch hab kaij: 
ACT11:5	“While I was in the town of Joppa I was praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. Something that looked like a large sheet was being let down by its four corners from heaven, and it came down to me.  	“Am ani daha Joppa t am ch am hu hebai ni‑hoꞌigeꞌidahun. T am ni‑nena ed hab e juh mat ab haꞌichu i e huduni dahm kahchim t amjed k hab mahs mo g lohna ch shaꞌi si geꞌej ch an aꞌai e uꞌukch chuhchpulij an ch am ni‑tahgio i e ul.

ACT11:7	Then I heard a voice that told me, ‘Get up, Peter, kill and eat.’ 	“K ab hahawa hema si neok ch hab kaij, ‘Peter, i g wuhshani k wabsh chum haschu am wo muꞌa k hekaj wo e gegos.’ 
ACT11:8	But I replied, ‘Absolutely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth!’ 	“Kuni hab kaij, ‘Ih, pi ant am hu hab wo ni‑juh, ni‑kownalig. Pi ani hekid koꞌa hegai mo g m‑chehanig pi t‑hiwgid.’ 
ACT11:9	The voice from heaven spoke again, and said, ‘Don't you call unclean what God has made clean!’  	“K hab ep kaij hegai mo ab neok, ‘Pi g hab shaꞌi elid mas pi apꞌe hegai mo haschu g Jiosh hemu am m‑chehgid mo s‑apꞌe.’ Neh, bo kaij ab ni‑wui.  
ACT11:10	This happened three times, and then it was all taken back into heaven.  	Kut id hab e juh waikko. T amjed im hu hahawa uhpam i e bei ihda haꞌichu am dahm kahchim wui. 
ACT11:11	At that very moment three men were standing in front of the house where we were staying. They had been sent from Caesarea to see me.  	“Kutki eda heki hu am haꞌi dada waik g oꞌodham. Idam ha‑geꞌejig o hab chehgig Cornelius ch am kih Cesaria t am ch ab ha cheha matsh ab wo i ni‑wai. Tki am dada mani am da.  
ACT11:12	The Spirit told me to go with them, and not to worry about who they were. These six brothers here also went with me, and we went into the man's house.  	K hab ni‑ahgid g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag mant pi has wo shaꞌi ha el mo d ge gawul mahs hemajkam k wabsh wo ha oi. T idam chuhdp t‑wepnag m ia gegok am ni‑wehm hihi Cesaria wui k am ni‑wehm i wahp Cornelius kih ed. 
ACT11:13	He explained to us how an angel had appeared to him in his house, who told him, ‘Send someone to Joppa, and fetch Simon, also called Peter,  	“K heg am t‑ahgid matsh g anghil am jiwia kihj am k hab kaij, ‘Am g haꞌi ha chehani mat am wo hihi Joppa wui k am wo wai hegai oꞌodham mo hab chehgig Simon Peter.

ACT11:15	When I started speaking, the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as happened to us in the beginning.  	“Pegih, tki wa woho hab e juh. Kunt am him k am wabsh chum haꞌichu i ha ahgid. T g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ab i hud ha dahm mat wa hab e juh am t‑wehhejed ga hu si i wehpeg.  
ACT11:16	Then I remembered what the Lord said, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’  	Nt am hahawa i chegito mo wa hab kaij g t‑kownalig Jesus, ‘Mat ab i em‑mah g John g pahl wakona. T wabshaba g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag g si geꞌe gewkdag ab wo i em‑mah pi shaꞌi muꞌi tash iꞌajed.’  
ACT11:17	Since God gave them the same gift as he gave us when we trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ, what power did I have to oppose God?” 	Neh, t id amjed am si i e tashogi mat g Jiosh ab ha mah hegam gawul mahs hemajkam hegai mahkigdag mat ahchim ab t‑mah mat hekid ab i s‑wohoch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ab amjed g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ. Kunt pi has masma am hu wo shaꞌi kuh g Jiosh id amjed.” Neh, bash kaij g Peter. 
ACT11:18	After they had heard this explanation, they didn't argue with him anymore, and praised God, saying, “Now God has granted the opportunity to repent and have eternal life to foreigners as well.” 	Tsh idam am i kah wehs haꞌichu k pi ab hu has hahawa ep ahg ch wabsh si s‑hehgigam ab ihm g Jiosh ch hab kaij, “Pegih, boki d Jiosh hab elida mat idam gawul mahs hemajkam hab waꞌap gam hu wo s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegitoi k wo bei g pi ha huhugedam doakag.” 
ACT11:19	Now those who had been scattered by the persecution that happened when Stephen was killed, traveled all the way to Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch. They only spread the good news among the Jews.  	Kutsh haꞌi hegam matsh wa e gantad matsh hekid i e muhkid g Steven gam hu ahgahi g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga Phenicia ch Cyprus jejewed t am ch Antiok kihhim t am k hegam an waꞌi ha mihshmad Tutuligo.  
ACT11:20	But when some of them who were from Cyprus and Cyrene arrived in Antioch, they shared the good news with the Greeks too, telling them about the Lord Jesus.  	Tsh am hahawa haꞌi dada Antiok t am ab amjed g Cyprus ch Cyrene k am i ha mihshmad hegam ehp mo d gawul mahs hemajkam.  
ACT11:21	The power of the Lord was with them and a large number trusted in the Lord and turned to him.  	Tsh g Jiosh am i gewkai g haꞌichu ha‑ahga. Kutsh muꞌijj hegam hemajkam ab i s‑ha wohochud k ab i e dagito Jesus wui. 
ACT11:22	News about what had happened reached the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.  	Tsh am i kah hegam mash ab ihm g Jesus ch ab dadha Jerusalem t ab matsh has i e juh am Antiok t am k ab hahawa cheha g Barnabas matsh am wo him k wo i ha wehmt.  
ACT11:23	When he arrived and saw for himself how God's grace was working, he was delighted. He encouraged all of them to completely dedicate themselves to God and to stay true.  	Tsh ged hu jiwia k am i nei si s‑hehgigch matki wa woho g Jiosh ab si s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌel. Sh am ha ahgid mamt wehs ab wo i e dagito Jiosh wui k pi hekid wo shaꞌi dagito hegai mamt haschu ab i bei.  
ACT11:24	Barnabas was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit, and put his whole trust in God. Many people were brought to the Lord.  	Sh wa eda si s‑ap d oꞌodham g Barnabas ch si e dagitokch Jesus wui ch ab si uꞌukch g gewkdag ab amjed g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. Tsh muꞌijj ab i s‑wohoch g haꞌichu ahgaj ab amjed g Jesus.  
ACT11:25	Then Barnabas went on to Tarsus to look for Saul,  	Tsh hekaj hab i e ah g Barnabas matsh am wo i bei g Saul mat heg am wo i ha wehmt. Sh eda heg am kih Tarsus kihhim t am. 
ACT11:26	and when he found him, he took Saul back with him to Antioch. Over the course of the next year they worked together with the church, teaching the message to crowds of people. It was in Antioch that the believers were first called “Christians.” 	k am i chehg k ab uhpam i wai Antiok wui.

ACT11:27	It was during this time that some prophets went from Jerusalem to Antioch.  	Tsh wa eda am haꞌi dada g Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam ab Jerusalem t amjed amai Antiok t am.  
ACT11:28-29	One of them called Agabus stood up and gave a prophetic warning by the Spirit that there would be a terrible famine that would affect the known world. (This came true in the reign of Emperor Claudius).  The believers decided to send funds to help the brothers that lived in Judea, with everyone giving according to what they had.  	Sh idam hema hab chehgig Agabus. Tsh g Jiosh am i tashogi ihda mat g bihugig wo gei an wehsko jewed dahm. Kutsh am ha ahgi g Jesus ihmdam amai Antiok t am.

ACT12:1	Around this time King Herod began to persecute some members of the church.  	Tsh eda am i ha shoꞌigch g kownal Herod hegam mash ab ihm g Jesus  
ACT12:2	He had James, John's brother, executed by sword.  	k ab ha chehani g e‑shondalig. Tsh idam an bei hegai James mo d John wehnag k mua g is‑pahyokaj.  
ACT12:3	When he saw that the Jews were pleased by this, he had Peter arrested too. (This was during the Feast of Unleavened Bread.)  	Kush muꞌi si s‑hohhoꞌid g Tutuligo matsh hab e juh ihda. Tsh heg hekaj wabsh baꞌich i si e gewkai g Herod k g Peter an ep bei. Kutsh eda e ai g si geꞌe mihshmda mo eda g Tutuligo pi koꞌa g hegai pahn mo jewajidas wewaꞌak tash oidam.  
ACT12:4	After having Peter arrested, he threw him in prison, with four squads of four soldiers each to guard him. He planned to have Peter brought out for a public trial after the Passover. 	Tsh am ha cheha g Herod g e‑shondalig matsh wabsh wo kuh g Peter. Kumtsh am haha wo lodai am ha tahgio g hemajkam mat am wo i haꞌasa e piast. Tsh gamai chuhdp i e chuhcha g shondal matsh giꞌik e wehm wo nuhkud tash oidam ch s‑chuhugam oidam.  
ACT12:5	While Peter was kept in prison the church prayed earnestly to God for him.  	Sh wabshaba heg oidam am hahasko e hehemapad g Jesus ihmdam ch am wehhejed si e hoꞌigeꞌidahun. 
ACT12:6	The night before Herod was to have him put on trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, chained to each of them, and with guards at the door keeping watch.  	Kutsh am i e ai matsh baꞌich i siꞌalim wo e lodai g Peter. Tsh am i s‑chuk. Sh am woꞌo ch kohsh ha shahgid g gohk shondal mash am nuhkud.

ACT12:7	Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared, and a light shone in the cell. The angel shook Peter awake, saying “Quick! Get up!” The chains fell from his wrists,  	Tsh am haha wabsh jiwia g anghil k am wui i kekiwua g Peter. Tsh wabsh si ton am kukpaikud ch ed.

ACT12:9	So Peter followed the angel out. He didn't realize that what the angel was doing was actually happening—he thought he was seeing a vision. 	Tsh ab wahk k gam hu i oi. Kutsh am i wuwha ab amjed mash am kuhpikahim. Kush sha pi s‑wohoma mat woho ab i wuhshad g anghil nash pi hab e ahg mo wabsh chehchk.  
ACT12:10	They passed the first and second sets of guards, and came to the iron gate that led into the city. This opened for them by itself. They went out and down the street, when suddenly the angel left him.  	Tsh am hihim k am i wuwha wehpeg kihjeg t ab. Kush am hema kehk g shondal ch wabshaba pi am hu shaꞌi ha neid.

Tsh am waꞌi hekaj pi e haꞌichuch g anghil. 
ACT12:11	When Peter came to his senses, he said, “Now I realize this really happened! The Lord sent an angel to rescue me from Herod's power, and from everything that the Jewish people had planned.” 	Tsh am haha wabsh si i e taht g Peter k hab kaij, “Neh, woho atki hab e juh.

ACT12:12	Now that he was conscious of what had happened, Peter went to the house of Mary, the mother of John Mark. Many believers had gathered there, and were praying.  	Tsh amjed am hih kihj wui hegai Mary mo d John Mark jeꞌe. Kush eda muꞌijj am e hemapadch ch e hoꞌigeꞌidahun.  
ACT12:13	When he knocked on the gateway door, a servant girl called Rhoda came to open up.  	Kutsh ab si shontpag g pualit g Peter. Tsh am hema hih g ha‑pionag k hab chehgig Rhoda. 
ACT12:14	But recognizing Peter's voice, in her excitement she didn't open the door. Instead she ran back inside shouting, “Peter's at the door!” 	Tsh heg am i amich mo d Peter ch ab neok k si s‑hehgig ch gam hu uhpam meh pi ab hu i kuhpiꞌok g pualit k ged hu ha ahgid mo g Peter ab kehk jeg ed.

ACT12:16-17	Peter continued knocking. When they did eventually open the door, they saw it was him, and were totally shocked. Peter held up his hand for them to be quiet, and then explained to them how the Lord had led him out of the prison. “Let James and the brothers know about this,” he told them, and then left to go somewhere else. 	Kush eda ab wabsh kia shontpag. Tsh ab hahawa i kuhpiꞌo g pualit k nei mo ab kehk. Tsh am ha hekaj i wah k ab ha ihm k am i ha ahgid mat has masma g Jiosh i wuhshad ab amjed g kukpaikud.

ACT12:19	Herod had a thorough search made for him, but he couldn't be found. After interrogating the guards, Herod ordered that they should be executed. Then Herod left Judea and went to stay in Caesarea. 	Tsh g Herod am hahawa si ha cheha mat am wo i gahghi. Tsh wabshaba pi shaꞌi mai mas hebai hih.

ACT12:20	Now Herod had become furious with the people of Tyre and Sidon. They sent a joint delegation to see him and managed to win Blastus, the king's personal assistant, over to their side. They pleaded for peace with Herod because they were dependent on the king's territory for food.  	Tsh am hebai i cheka.

ACT13:4-5	So Barnabas and Saul, directed by the Holy Spirit, went to Seleucia. From there they sailed to Cyprus.  Arriving at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. John was with them as their assistant.  	Tsh gam hu hihi g Barnabas ch Saul mash wa g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag am i ha tashogid. Kutsh am ep i ha oi g John Mark matsh am wo i ha wehmt.

ACT13:6-8	They traveled throughout the island and eventually came to Paphos. There they found a Jewish magician, a false prophet by the name of Bar-jesus.  He was close to the governor, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. Sergius Paulus invited Barnabas and Saul to come and visit him since he wanted to hear the word of God.  But the magician Elymas (his Greek name) opposed them, trying to prevent the governor from trusting in God. 	Sh gam hu aigo hema ep kihhimag ch hab chehgig Paphos.

ACT13:27	The people living in Jerusalem and their leaders didn't recognize Jesus or understand the words spoken by the prophets that are read every Sabbath. In fact they fulfilled the prophetic words by condemning him!  	Hegam kekelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam atki an oꞌoha matsh has wo masmak g Jiosh si Kehsha.

ACT13:32-33	We are here to bring to you the good news of the promise that God made to our forefathers,  that he has now fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus from the dead. As it is written in Psalm 2: ‘You are my Son; today I have become your Father.’  	Kutt hemuch ia dada k ia uꞌapa ihda s‑kehg haꞌichu ahga em‑wui.

For what I'm doing in your lifetime is something that you could never believe, even if someone told you!’ ” 	“T an ep oꞌoha g kelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam mo hab kaij g Jiosh:

ACT13:46	So Paul and Barnabas spoke out strongly, saying “We had to speak the word of God to you first. But now that you're rejecting it—you're deciding that you're not worthy of eternal life—well now we're turning to the foreigners.  	Tsh wabshaba idam Paul am haha wabsh si ha ahgi, “Ni‑hajuni, bo chum mahs matt wehpeg ab wo em‑ahgi g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ab amjed g si Kehshaj.

ACT14:15	“People, what are you doing? We are human beings with the same kind of nature as you. We came to bring you good news, so you could turn from these pointless things to a God who is truly alive. He is the one who made heaven, earth, and sea, and everything in them.  	“Pi g hab wo t‑elidad machs d jijosh. Dach wabsh oꞌodham hab masma mam ahpim.

ACT15:2	Paul and Barnabas had many arguments and debates with them. So Paul and Barnabas and some others were appointed to go to Jerusalem and talk to the apostles and leaders there about this issue.

ACT15:5	But they were opposed by some of the believers who belonged to the Pharisee faction. They said, “These converts have to be circumcised, and instructed to observe the law of Moses.” 	Tsh wabshaba am haꞌi ab ha wui gegokiwua hegam mash si s‑gewkam oid g chehanig ch hab kaij, “Hemho wa at wo e oꞌoha an e pahl hikuchk g chechoj k am hab wo junihid hegai t‑chehanig mo g Jiosh ab t‑mahkch.”

ACT15:7	After much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “Brothers, you know that some time ago God chose me from among you so that the foreigners could hear the message of good news and trust in Jesus.  	Tsh g Peter am i kekiwua k hab kaij: 
ACT15:8	God, who knows our hearts, has shown that he accepts them, giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us.  	Jiosh o s‑mahch g oꞌodham chegitoi ch ab ep ha mah g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag hab wa masma mat ahchim hab t‑juh.

ACT15:14	Simon has described how God first revealed his concern for the foreigners by taking from them a people committed to him.  	Peter o am t‑ahgid matsh has masma g Jiosh am chehgi mo pihk e elid ha hekaj g nahnko mahs hemajkam ch am haꞌi i ha gawulkai mat d wo hemajkamgajk.

ACT15:19	So my decision is that we shouldn't make it difficult for foreigners who turn to God.  	“Kuni hab ep s‑cheꞌimk mani hab hi elid matt pi ab hu wo ha mohtoꞌi g t‑chehanigkaj hegam gawul mahs hemajkam mat ab i e nohnogi Jiosh wui.

ACT15:21	For the law of Moses has been taught in every town for a long, long time—it's read in the synagogues every Sabbath.” 	Id o wehsko si s‑ap s‑e mahch no pi an ahgachug wehs kihhim ch ed ch am e neꞌokchulid t‑wehm oꞌodham ha‑chechopi ed.” 
ACT15:22	Then the apostles and elders, together with the whole church, decided it would be good to choose some representatives and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas Barsabbas and Silas, leaders among the brothers,  	Tsh idam Jesus chuhchai ch geꞌeged am i apꞌech am wehs ha wehm hegam mash ab ihm g Jesus amai matsh am haꞌi wo i ha chuhcha.

ACT15:24	We have heard that some from our group have confused you with their teachings, causing you trouble. We certainly didn't tell them to do this!  	“Idam Barnabas ch Paul o ab t‑ahgid mat am haꞌi hihi g t‑wehm oꞌodham k am em‑kudu am haꞌichu pi ap em‑ahgidk. Kuch eda wa chum pi shaꞌi ha apꞌechud mat hab wo e juh.  
ACT15:25-26	So we have agreed to choose some representatives and send them to you together with our much-loved brothers Barnabas and Paul,  who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

ACT15:37	Barnabas planned to take along John Mark too.  	Kush g Barnabas hab chum kaij mat wo bek g John Mark.  
ACT15:38	But Paul didn't think it was a good idea to take him with them, since he'd left them in Pamphylia and hadn't continued working with them.  	Tsh wabshaba g Paul pi hohhoꞌi mat wo bek nat pi wa am wabsh i ha dagito Pamphylia t am k pi am hu ha wehm i nahto g chikpan.

ACT16:1	Paul went first to Derbe, and then on to Lystra, where he met a believer by the name of Timothy. He was the son of a Jewish Christian mother, and his father was Greek.

ACT16:6	They traveled through the districts of Phrygia and Galatia, since the Holy Spirit prevented them from going to the province of Asia to speak the word.

ACT16:14	One of them was called Lydia, who sold purple cloth from the town of Thyatira. She worshiped God, and she listened to us. The Lord opened her mind to what Paul was saying, and she accepted what he told her.

ACT16:19	But when her masters saw they had lost their means of making money, they grabbed hold of Paul and Silas and dragged them before the authorities at the marketplace.

ACT17:2-3	As usual, Paul went into the synagogue and over the course of three Sabbaths he debated with them using the Scriptures.  He explained what the Scriptures meant, proving that the Messiah had to die and rise from the dead. “This Jesus I'm telling you about—he is the Messiah,” he told them.  	Tsh heg wui am hihi hegam Paul mo hab wa e wua chum hekid.

ACT17:4-5	Some of them were convinced and joined Paul and Silas, along with many Greek-speaking worshipers and some leading women of the town. But the Jews became jealous and with some rabble-rousers they gathered from the marketplace they formed a mob. They rioted in the town, and attacked Jason's house. They tried to find Paul and Silas so they could bring them before the people.  	Kutsh haꞌi ab i s‑wohochud k ab i ha wehmt hegam Paul.

ACT17:6-7	When they couldn't find them they dragged Jason and some of the other believers before the town leaders, shouting, “These people are famous for causing trouble, turning the world upside down. Now they've come here,  and Jason has made them welcome in his house. They all defy Caesar's decrees, committing treason by saying there is another king called Jesus.”  	Sh wabshaba pi am hu haꞌichug. Kush heg hi wa Jason am da. Kush haꞌi ep dadha g wehmaj wohochuddam.

ACT17:8	The people and the leaders of the town were very disturbed when they heard this.  	Neh, bash kaij ch hekaj ab si i ha kudut g hemajkam ch hahaꞌichu mat wabsh wohoꞌi babgat.  
ACT17:9	So they made Jason and the others post bail before they let them go. 	Tsh g hahaꞌichu am cheha g Jason ch hegam haꞌi mat wo ha namkid haꞌakia mo haschu d i ha‑chehanig. Kutsh am hab e juh. Tsh hahawa ha dagito. 
ACT17:10	The believers had Paul and Silas leave for Berea that very night. When they arrived in Berea they went to the Jewish synagogue.  	Tsh am i s‑chuk. Tsh hegam Jesus ihmdam am ha ahgi idam Paul matsh gam hu wo hihi Berea kihhim wui. Tsh ged hu dada k am ha hekaj hihi Tutuligo ha‑cheopi wui.  
ACT17:11	The people there had a better attitude than those in Thessalonica in that they were very quick to accept the word, and every day they examined the Scriptures to make sure what they were told was right.  	Tsh idam s‑ap ab i ha nei. Sh am ha mihshmad. Kush si s‑hohhoꞌid ch ab kaiham g haꞌichu ha‑ahga ch wehs tashkaj am si hoan g Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana mat wo s‑mai mas wa woho hegai mash g Paul am ha ahgid.  
ACT17:12	As a result many of them became believers, along with some highly-placed Greek women and men. 	Tsh muꞌijj ab i s‑wohoch g Tutuligo. Tsh muꞌijj g gawul mahs hemajkam hab waꞌap ab i s‑wohoch. Haꞌi idam ash d s‑has hahaꞌichu uꞌuwi. 
ACT17:13	But when the Jews in Thessalonica heard that Paul was also spreading the word of God in Berea, they went there and caused the same kind of trouble, stirring up the crowds.  	Tsh am wabsh i chum kah g Tutuligo am Thessalonica t am mash idam Paul am ha mihshmad Berea t am hab wa ehp k am ha hekaj i hihim k am i ha kudu g hemajkam.  
ACT17:14	Immediately the believers sent Paul to the coast, while Silas and Timothy remained behind.  	Kutsh heg hekaj am ahgi g Paul hegam mash ab s‑wohochud mat gam hu wo hih ge kahchki hugidgo. Tsh wabshaba g Silas am waꞌi wih Berea t am g Timothy wehm.  
ACT17:15	Those escorting Paul took him as far as Athens, and then returned with instructions from Paul to Silas and Timothy that they should join him there as soon as possible. 	Tsh hegam matsh am i bei g Paul gam hu uꞌapa Athens kihhim t am. Tsh am hahawa ha ahgi g Paul mat wo ha ahgi g Silas ch Timothy mamt hekid wo i e nakog k ab ha hekaj wo i hihi. Tsh amjed gam hu hahawa uhpam hihi idam e‑kihhim wui. 
ACT17:16	While Paul was waiting for them in Athens he was very troubled to see all the idolatry in the city.  	Sh am daha g Paul Athens t am ch am ha nenida g Silas ch Timothy. Sh eda wehsko chuhch g ha‑jijoshta. Sh g Paul am ha neid idam ch hab si pi ap e tahtk.  
ACT17:17-18	He debated in the synagogue with the Jews and those who worshiped God,  as well as in the marketplace with those he happened to meet from day to day.  Some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also argued with him. “What is he going on about?”  they wondered. Others concluded, “He seems to be teaching about some foreign gods,” because he was speaking about Jesus and the resurrection.  	Tsh am wabsh apꞌet mat ha wehm wo si i aꞌaga g hemajkam am ha‑cheopi ed. Kush am haꞌi ha wehm e mihshmad g gawul mahs hemajkam. 
ACT17:19-21	So they took him to the Areopagus  and asked him, “Please tell us about this new teaching that you're promoting.  We're hearing from you things that sound odd to us, so we'd like to know what they mean.”  (All the Athenians, including foreigners who lived there, spent their whole time doing nothing except explaining or listening to something new). 	Kush eda hegam kihkam ch hegam mo am wabsh sha dadha s‑hohhoꞌid mat tash oidam wo kaihamad ch wo aꞌagad hegai mo haschu d si wechij ahga.

ACT17:22	Paul stood up right in the middle of the Areopagus and said, “People of Athens, I notice you are very religious about everything.  	Tsh am hahawa kekiwua g Paul k hab kaij, “Ahpim kihkam amki ab si has ha elid g jijosh.  
ACT17:23	As I was walking along, looking at your shrines, I found an altar that had the inscription, ‘To an Unknown God.’ This unknown God whom you worship is the one I'm describing to you.

ACT17:24	The God who created the world and everything in it, the Lord of heaven and earth, doesn't live in temples we make.  	“Do ihda Jiosh mat wehs haꞌichu nahto ch d kownal wehs haꞌichu dahm. Wehsko o an haꞌichug g Jiosh. K pi hab shaꞌi mahs mas am hebai wabsh wo e dai hab masma mam hab ha wua g e‑jijoshta.  
ACT17:25	He doesn't need to be served by us as if he needed anything, since he is the source of all life for every living being.  	Jiosh o ab t‑mahkch g doakag ch wehs haꞌichu. K pi am hu haꞌichu d shaꞌi hegai mas ab i si tatchua ab amjed g oꞌodham mat ab wo mah chikpank. 
ACT17:26	From one man he made all the peoples who live on the earth, and decided beforehand when and where they should live.  	“Jiosh at am hemako nahto g oꞌodham k ab amjed i wuhshad g wehs nahnko mahs hemajkam k an aꞌai i ha gantad wehsko jewed oidk mat hebai heki hu i apꞌech mat an wo kihkad.  
ACT17:27	God's purpose was that they should seek him, hoping they would reach out for him and find him—though he isn't far from any one of us.  	K hab d elidaj mat am wo i e gahgidahi g Jiosh k atp hems wo cheh. Pi o shaꞌi mehk ab hema i t‑amjed

ACT17:29	Since we are his family we shouldn't think that God is like gold, or silver, or stone, shaped by human artistry and thinking.  	“Pegih neh, id o d wohokam mach d aꞌaligaj g Jiosh. Tt pi hab wo ge t‑ahgad mas g wohokam Jiosh hab mahs mo idam em‑jijoshta mat wabsh g oꞌodham am nahto g ohlakaj o g plahdakaj o g hodaikaj.  
ACT17:30	God disregarded people's ignorance in the past, but now he commands everyone everywhere to repent.  	Heki o hu pi mahch g hemajkam g Jiosh tatchui. K g Jiosh si s‑hemajim am ha nakog. Ni wabshaba hemu em‑ahgid mo hahawa ab si i ha chehani g hemajkam wehsko mat gam hu wo s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegitoi.  
ACT17:31	For he has set a time when he will rightly judge the world by the man he has appointed, and he proved to everyone that he is the one by raising him from the dead.” 	Am at i apꞌech g tash mat wehs wo ha lodai g hemajkam k heki hu am hema si i kei mat hab wo juh g lodaita. Tsh id ia mahsi t‑shahgid k ia oimmelhim ch e muhkid. Tsh g Jiosh ab i wuhshad muhkig t amjed mat wo wohokamch mo d si Kehshaj.” Neh, bash kaij g Paul. 
ACT17:32	Some of them laughed when they heard about the resurrection of the dead, while others said, “Please come back so we can hear more about this later.”  	Tsh idam am i kah mo hab kaij matsh hema i wuhsh ab muhkig amjed. Kush haꞌijj wabsh si ash ch wabshaba haꞌi hab kaij, “Am g wa ep t‑jehnigid ab amjed ihda.”  
ACT17:33	So Paul left them.  	Tsh amjed gam hu hahawa hih g Paul.  
ACT17:34	A few men joined him and trusted in God, including Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, as well as a woman called Damaris, and some others. 	Tsh haꞌi ab s‑wohochud k ab i wehmt. Sh hema idam d Dionysius ch d hema hegam s‑chu aꞌamichuddam. Kush am hema d ep uwi ch hab chehgig Damaris. 
ACT18:1	Paul then left Athens and went to Corinth  	Tsh gam hu hahawa hih g Paul ab Athens t amjed k am him k am jiwia Corinth kihhim t am.  
ACT18:2	where he met a Jew named Aquila. Aquila was originally from Pontus, and had just arrived from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius  had ordered all Jews expelled from Rome.

Kutsh am i dada g Silas ch Timothy ab Macedonia jewed t amjed. Tsh g Paul am hahawa i dagito g e‑chikpan k heg am himch matsh am hahawa si i ha mihshmad am si s‑mahch ch ahg ab ha wui g Tutuligo mo g Jesus d Jiosh si Kehsha mat wo t‑doꞌibia.  
ACT18:6	When they opposed him and cursed him, he shook out his clothes and told them, “Your blood is on your own heads! I am innocent of any guilt, and from now on I will go to the foreigners.” 	Tsh wabshaba ab wui gegokiwua idam k am si pi ap has ahg.

Nt iaꞌi amjed g gawul mahs hemajkam ab wo i ha mihshmad.”  
ACT18:7	He left and went to stay with Titius Justus, who worshiped God and whose house was next door to the synagogue.  	Neh, tsh iaꞌi dagito g ha‑cheopi k ged hu hahawa ha mihshmad g hemajkam hema kih am g gawul mahs oꞌodham. Id ash ab ihm g Jiosh ch hab chehgig Titius Justus ch an kih hugidaj an g Tutuligo ha‑cheopi.  
ACT18:8	Crispus, leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord together with his whole household. Many of the people of Corinth who heard the message became believers and were baptized. 	Kutsh muꞌi ep ab i s‑wohoch am i kahk k am e pahl wapko. Hema ash d chum ha wanimeddam g Tutuligo ch hab chehgig Crispus ch ab i s‑wohoch g e‑wehm kihkam ha wehm. 
ACT18:9-10	The Lord told Paul in a vision at night: “Don't be afraid. Speak up, don't keep quiet—  because I am with you, and no-one will attack you, for many people in this city are mine.”  	Tsh am hu hebai chuhug ch ed am haꞌichu hab e juh Paul nena ed mash kah g Jesus.

ACT18:12	However during the time when Gallio  was the governor of Achaia, the Jews united in an attack against Paul and brought him before the court. 	Tsh am hahawa hema i dahiwua g kownal am Greek hemajkam ha‑jewedga am k hab chehgig Gallio. Tsh g Tutuligo am i e hemapad k an bei g Paul k am uꞌapa geꞌe kih t am

ACT18:14	But just as Paul was about to defend himself, Gallio told the Jews, “If you Jews were bringing criminal charges or some serious legal offense, there would be a reason for me to listen to your case.  	Kutsh am haha wabsh wo i chum neo g Paul. Sh wabshaba Gallio hab ha ahg, “Pi oki ab wui kehk g geꞌe kownal chehanig. T heg hekaj pi wo ni‑apꞌet mant ab wo em‑kaiha.

Kumtsh heki hu mashcha ab amjed g Jesus. Kush si s‑hohhoꞌid ch am ahgahim ch si s‑ap ha mashcham ch eda heg waꞌi s‑mahch John pahl wakona.

ACT19:4	“John baptized with the baptism of repentance,” said Paul. He told the people that they should trust in the one who would come after him—that is, they should trust in Jesus.  	Sh hab hahawa ep kaij g Paul, “M o wa woho mash heg am ha ahgid mat gam hu wo s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegitoi ch wabshaba am ep ha ahgid mat ab wo i s‑wohoch hegai mat am epai wo i e maskogi.

ACT19:9	But some of them were stubborn, and refused to accept. They denounced the Way to the crowd. So Paul gave up on them and left the synagogue, taking the believers with him. Then he had discussions every day at the hall of Tyrannus. 	Tsh wabshaba haꞌi pi wohochud k wabsh si pi ap neneok ab amjed g Jesus himdag am ha kaichudch g hemajkam.

ACT19:13-14	Some Jews who were going around exorcising decided to use the name of the Lord Jesus when they drove out evil spirits. They'd say, “I command you to leave in the name of the Jesus that Paul talks about.”  The ones doing this were the seven sons of Sceva, a Jew and a chief priest.

ACT19:17	People living in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks, heard about this. They were all in awe at what had happened, and the name of the Lord Jesus gained great respect.  	Kutsh wehsijj kah ihda amai Ephesus t am k atsh si s‑ehbeni k ab si has i el g t‑kownalig Jesus.  
ACT19:18	Many came to trust in the Lord and confessed their sins, openly admitting their evil practices.  	Tsh muꞌijj hegam matsh ab i s‑wohoch s‑kehg haꞌichu ahga ab amjed g Jesus am i e hemapad k mahsko wua g pi ap e‑chuꞌijig am wehs ha tahgio g hemajkam.  
ACT19:19	A number of those who used to practice sorcery collected their books on magic and brought them to be burned publicly. They worked out how much the books were worth, and the total was fifty thousand silver coins.  	Tsh muꞌijj hegam mash hab chum e elid mo d mamakai am uꞌapa hegam e‑oꞌohana mo an ahgas g hihoina k am ha chehgid k ha mei. Tsh eda am i kuint g ha‑namkig idam oꞌohana mash am mei.

ACT19:21	Some time after this Paul decided to go to Jerusalem, passing first through Macedonia and Achaia. “After I've been there, I'll have to go to Rome,” he said.  	Tsh amjed hab i e ah g Paul matsh gam hu wo hih Macedonia ch Greece jejewed oidk k amjed gam hu haha wo hih Jerusalem wui k amjed am Rome wui wo hih.  
ACT19:22	He sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he stayed on for a while in the province of Asia. 	Kush eda g Timothy ch Erastus am wehmaj. Kush am ha ahgid g Paul matsh am wo hihi Macedonia wui. Tsh g Paul am wih Asia ch ed heꞌes i tash. 
ACT19:23	It was about this time that serious problems occurred regarding the Way.  	Kutsh iaꞌi idani am i e kudu g hemajkam ab Ephesus t ab heg hekaj Jesus himdag.  
ACT19:24	A man called Demetrius, a silversmith, was producing small silver replicas of the temple of the goddess Artemis. This business brought in a great deal of work for such craftsmen.  	Amai ash am hema kehk g geꞌe cheopi. Kush am eda e kehshch g uwi ha‑jioshga ch hab chehgig Artemis. Kush am hema d plahda chikpandam ch hab chehgig Demetrius.

Kutsh g Demetrius am i ha hemapai hegam mash hab waꞌap mahs chikpan hab wua k am si s‑gewkam hab kaij ab ha wui, “Ni‑naipijju, s‑mahch am mo g s‑t‑kaistalig ab him id amjed chikpan.  
ACT19:26	As you're no doubt aware from what you've seen and heard—not just here in Ephesus, but throughout almost the whole of Asia—this man Paul has convinced and misled many people, telling them that there are no such things as gods made by human hands.  	Kum eda si neid ch ep kah ihda hab chehgi Paul mo hab kaij mo idam t‑jijoshga pi d shaꞌi jijosh. T hab am gawul juh g e‑chegitoi g muꞌi hemajkam ab i s‑wohochudk iia Ephesus t am ch chum alo wehsko am Asia jewed oidk.  
ACT19:27	It's not just a question that our business will be in danger of losing respect, but that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be considered worthless. Artemis herself would be dethroned from her high position as the one whom everyone in Asia and the whole world worships.” 	Kut wo e padch g t‑chikpan nat pi pi ab hu hab masma wo e ihmad g Artemis mo hemuch wehsko ab si e ihm. T g cheopigaj pi ab hu wo e haꞌichuch.” 
ACT19:28	When they heard this they became furious, and shouted out, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”  	Tsh am i kah idam mat am e hemapai k atsh si babgat k si s‑kaidam hihnk ch hab kaij, “B ach si has elid g t‑jioshga Artemis.”  
ACT19:29	The city was in complete chaos. People rushed towards the amphitheatre, dragging along with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's traveling companions who were from Macedonia.

ACT19:31	Some of the provincial officials, who were Paul's friends, also sent a message begging him not to go into the amphitheatre. 	Tsh haꞌi hegam mash d hahaꞌichu ch d naipijjuj g Paul hab waꞌap ahgid matsh pi am hu wo hih mamt am i ha ui idam gohk. 
ACT19:32	Some were shouting one thing, and some something else, for the crowd that had gathered was in total confusion—most of them had no idea why they were there.

ACT19:33	The Jews in the crowd pushed Alexander to the front. Alexander motioned with his hand for them to be quiet, wanting to explain things to the people.  	Tsh g Tutuligo am hema i kei mat am wo him k ab wo i kekiwua ha wehhejed k am wo ha ahgi mo pi d ha‑chuꞌijig g Tutuligo.

ACT19:35	After the town clerk had managed to quiet the mob down, he told them, “People of Ephesus, who doesn't know that the city of the Ephesians is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image that fell from heaven?  	Tsh g s‑has haꞌichu oꞌohandam ha shohbi g hemajkam ash hab kaijch, “Ahpim kihkam!

ACT19:40	In fact we ourselves are in danger of being accused of being responsible for this riot today, since there was no reason for it, and we can't justify why it happened.”  	T hahawa pi ab hu wo t‑abch g kownal machs wabsh t‑cheggia heg hekaj mat haschu has i e juh id tashkaj.

ACT19:41	When he had finished speaking, he dismissed the crowd. 	Neh, bash kaij ch ha dagito. 
ACT20:1	Once the uproar had died down, Paul called the believers together and encouraged them. Then he said goodbye, and left for Macedonia.  	Tsh am i dodolimat haꞌichu. Tsh g Paul am i ha hemapai g e‑wehm wohochuddam k am si i ha gewkemhun k am hahawa ha dagito k gam hu aigo i chesh Macedonia t am

So he decided to return through Macedonia.  	k ia haꞌichugkahim waik mashad. T am hebai i cheka, t am hahawa i chum e nako mat am aigo i chesh Syria jewed wui.

ACT20:7-8	Paul was speaking on the first day of the week as we gathered together to break bread. He was planning to leave in the morning, and went on speaking until midnight.  (The upstairs room where we were meeting was lit by many lamps.) 	Am hu hebai d i shahwai hudunk. Tt am i t‑hemapai mo an hebai uhgk g kih k am t‑wehm t‑gegos matt am wo hehgigchul g Jiosh.

ACT20:9	A young man called Eutychus was sitting in the window, and he began feeling very sleepy. As Paul went on speaking he fell sound asleep and tumbled down from the third story. When they picked him up they found he was dead. 	K an hema daha g wechij oꞌodham wintani t an ch hab chehgig Eutycus ch atsh am i s‑kohsim k kohsh k i gei ab wintani t amjed k ged hu gei jewedo.

ACT20:11-12	Paul went back upstairs, broke bread, and ate together with them. He went on talking with them until dawn came, and then he left.  They took the young man home alive and well, and were very thankful for this. 	T g hajunij gam hu hahawa i bei hegai wechij oꞌodham kihj wui si s‑ap e tahtkch mo d doakam.

ACT20:15-16	Sailing on from there we arrived off Kios, and the next day we stopped briefly at Samos, and the following day we arrived at Miletus.  Paul had planned to sail on past Ephesus so he wouldn't have to spend time in the province of Asia. He was keen to get to Jerusalem in time for the Day of Pentecost. 	k amjed gam hu ai g Chios kihhim. K am baꞌich d ep i tash, tt gam hu ai g Samos kihhim.

ACT21:11	Approaching us, he took Paul's belt, and bound his own hands and feet.

ACT21:24	Go with them and perform the purification rituals with them, paying for them to have their heads shaved.

ACT22:5	As the high priest and the council of the elders can also verify, I received from them letters of authorization addressed to the Jewish brothers in Damascus, and went there to arrest these people and bring them as prisoners to Jerusalem to be punished.

He was a religious man who observed the law, and was highly respected by the Jews who lived in the town.  	“Kuki wa am hema kih g oꞌodham ch hab chehgig Ananias ch ab si ihm g Jiosh ch ep am si oid g chehanig.

ACT24:14	But I will admit this to you: I serve the God of our fathers following the beliefs of the Way, which they call a heretical sect. I believe everything the law teaches and what is written in the books of the prophets.  	“M o hi wa woho mani ab ihm g Jiosh am oidch ihda himdag mo idam hab elid mo pi d wohokam.

ACT25:2-3	The chief priests and Jewish leaders came to him and brought their charges against Paul.

ACT25:5	“Your leaders can come with me, and make their accusation against this man, if he has done anything wrong,” he told them. 	Kumt am haꞌi wo ni‑oid k am wo ah mam haschu ab abchud.” 
ACT25:6	After staying there with them for no more than eight or ten days, Festus returned to Caesarea. The following day he took his seat as judge, and ordered that Paul be brought before him.

ACT25:11	If I've committed a crime and have done something that deserves death, I do not ask to be pardoned from a death sentence. But if there's no substance to these accusations they're making against me, then nobody has the right to hand me over to them.

ACT25:23	The next day Agrippa arrived with Bernice in great ceremonial splendor and entered the auditorium with the commanders and leading citizens. Then Festus ordered Paul to be brought in.

ACT25:24	“King Agrippa, and everyone who is present here with us,” Festus began, “you see before you this man whom all the Jewish people, both here and in Jerusalem, have complained to me about, shouting that he shouldn't be allowed to live.  	K g Festus hab hahawa kaij:

ACT25:26-27	But I don't have anything specific to write about him to His Imperial Majesty. That's why I have brought him before you so I can have something definite to write.

ACT26:2-3	“I am delighted, King Agrippa, to make my defense before you today regarding everything I am accused of by the Jews,  particularly because you are an expert in all Jewish issues and customs. I beg your patient indulgence as you listen to what I have to say. 	k hab kaij:

ACT26:13	At about noon as I was on my way, Your Majesty, I saw a light from heaven that blazed brighter than the sun. It shone around me and those who were traveling with me.  	“Pegih neh, ahpi si s‑has haꞌichu, am achd hihim wohg ch ed am hu i dahm juhk.

ACT27:1	When the time came for us to sail to Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion called Julius of the Imperial Regiment.

ACT27:7	We sailed slowly for several days and eventually arrived off Cnidus. But since the winds wouldn't allow us to continue we sailed across to the lee of Crete, near to Salmone.  	k am gahi i shul. 
ACT27:8	With some difficulty we made our way along the coast until we arrived at a place called Fair Havens, near to the town of Lasea.  	Kutt heg hugid an bihbij k am hu wa has masma ga hu dada mash hebai s‑ap dadhaiwup g wapalko. K ia amjed pi shaꞌi mehk hegai kihhim mo d Lasia. 
ACT27:9	We'd lost a lot of time, and the voyage was becoming dangerous because it was now after the Fast. Paul warned them,  	Kuttki pi oi baꞌich hihim k ab wabsh ai mat wo si hewedad s‑hehpichꞌed. T hekaj wo s‑ta ehbidamak matt am gahi wo i shul. 
ACT27:10	“Men, I predict that this voyage will result in much hardship and loss—not just of the cargo and the ship, but also our very lives.”  	ch hab kaij, “Nehꞌe!

ACT27:12	Since the harbor was not large enough to over-winter in, the majority were in favor of leaving and trying if possible to reach Phoenix and spend the winter there—a harbor in Crete that faces northwest and southwest.

ACT27:15	The ship was forced out to sea and could not face into the wind. So we had to give in and allow ourselves to be driven before the wind.  	k ab si s‑ta ehbidam wiꞌichkwua g t‑wahlko.

ACT27:17	After hoisting it aboard, the sailors bound ropes around the hull to strengthen it. Then, worried that they would be wrecked on the Syrtis banks, they lowered the sea anchor and allowed the ship to be driven along.

Then you could have avoided all this hardship and loss.  	Kuch tash pi haꞌichu shaꞌi koꞌa.

ACT28:6	They were expecting him to swell up, or suddenly fall down dead.

ACT28:15	When some of the believers from Rome heard we had arrived they came to meet us at the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns. When Paul saw them, he was thankful to God and much encouraged.

ACT28:17	Three days later Paul invited the Jewish leaders there to come to see him. When they were all together he told them, “Brothers, even though I had not done anything wrong against the people or the customs of our forefathers, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Roman authorities.  	Muꞌi o am kih g Tutuligo. K am d i waik tash. T g Paul am i ha wai g ha‑geꞌegedga e‑kih wui. T am i e nam. K hab kaij ab ha wui:

ACT28:23	They made an appointment to meet with him. On that day many people came to where he was staying. From morning till night Paul was explaining to them, telling them about the kingdom of God. He tried to convince them about Jesus using the writings of the law of Moses and the prophets.  	Neh, bo kaij. T am hahawa aꞌaga k kei g tash mat wo e jehnigi. 
ACT28:24	Some accepted what Paul said, but some refused to believe.  	T haꞌi ab i s‑wohoch ab kaiok. T wabshaba haꞌijj pi shaꞌi wohoch.  
ACT28:25	They couldn't agree among themselves, and they left after Paul told them this: “The Holy Spirit said it well through Isaiah the prophet to your forefathers,  	T am i pi shaꞌi e apꞌet k hab e juh mat wo aꞌai hihi. T hekaj id hab ep chei g Paul, “Do si wohokam mash wa has i kaij g Jiosh ab em‑amjed ab Isaiabad wui. K an hab chuꞌig Isaiabad oꞌohana ed:

COL02:11-12	You were “circumcised” in him but not by human hands. You have been set free from sinful human nature by the “circumcision” Christ performed.  You were buried with him in baptism, and you were raised with him through your trust in what God did by raising him from the dead.  	Heki ach hu wa t-pahl hikuchk ahchim Tutuligo am t-chehanig oidch.

COL02:13-14	And even though you were dead because of your sins and being physically “uncircumcised,” he brought you to life together with him. He has forgiven us all our sins.  He wiped out the record of our debts according to the Law that was written down against us; he took away this barrier  by nailing it to the cross.

COL02:16-17	So don't let anyone criticize you for what you eat or what you drink, or regarding which religious festival, new moon ritual, or ceremonial sabbaths you choose to observe.  These are just a shadow of what was to come, for the physical reality is Christ.

COL02:18	Don't let anyone cheat you out of your prize by insisting you have to beat yourself, or worship angels. They think they are better than anyone else because of visions they say they've had, and become ridiculously conceited in their sinful minds.

COL02:19	Such people are not connected to the head that directs the body, nourished and joined together through the body's sinews and muscles. As the body is united together it grows the way God wants it to grow. 	ch pi ab hu hiwig g Jiosh si Kehsha. K eda heg d t-moꞌo ch s-ap ab i t-dagioꞌid ch t-geꞌelid.

COL02:20	If you died with Christ to the religious demands that this world insists upon,  why would you make yourself subject to such demands as if you were still part of this world?

COL02:23	Such rules may make some kind of sense to those who practice self-centered piety, who are so proud of being humble, and who “mortify the body;” but in reality they don't help at all in dealing with sinful desires. 	o pi woho d haꞌichu amichudadag.

COL03:5	So kill your worldly nature—sexual sin, immorality, lust, evil desires, greedily wanting to have more—this is the worship of idols.

He did this so he could create in himself one new person out of the two and so make peace,  and completely reconcile both of them to God through the cross as if they were just one body, having destroyed our hostility towards each other. 	ch pi mahch ch pi edgid g chehanigaj.

EPH04:16	It's because of him that the whole body operates, every joint holding it together as each individual part does what it's supposed to, and the whole body grows, building itself up in love.

EPH04:20-21	But that's not what you learned about Christ!  Didn't you hear about him? Weren't you taught concerning him? Didn't you learn the truth as it is in Jesus?  	Mtsh wabshaba ahpim ab kah g doꞌibiadag ahga k am i s‑mai g Christ. Am amsh em‑mashcham g wohokam ab amjed. Mt amjed pi hab wo chum masmak mo hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh.

EPH05:1	So then, imitate God since you're his much-loved children.  	Ab o si t‑tatchua g Jiosh. Kutt am oidch hab wo t‑junihid nach pi d aꞌaligaj.  
EPH05:2	Live in love, just as Christ loved you. He gave himself for us, a gift and sacrificial offering to God like a sweet-smelling perfume.

EPH05:4-5	Obscene talk, stupid chatter, and coarse jokes are totally inappropriate—instead you should be thanking God.  You know it's absolutely sure that no-one who is sexually immoral, or commits indecency, or who is greedy, or is an idol-worshiper will inherit anything in the kingdom of Christ and God.  	S‑mahch am mat pi am hu wo i ha wahpki g Jiosh hegam mo hab wa masma. Hegai mat wo s‑behim mo haschu pi ab hu d wuikamaj o heg jioshchud.

GAL01:6	I'm shocked at how quickly you're abandoning the God who by the grace of Christ called you.

GAL01:8-9	But if anyone, even we ourselves, or even an angel from heaven, should promote any other kind of good news  than what we have already told you, let them be condemned!  I repeat what we've told you before: if anyone promotes any other kind of good news than what you've already accepted, let them be condemned!

GAL01:10	Whose approval do you think I want—that of people, or of God? Do you think I'm trying to please people? If I wanted to please people I wouldn't be a servant of Christ! 	Tp hems pi wo hohhoꞌi g hemajkam mani has kaij. Ni eda pi hab ahgch hab kaij mas g hemajkam wo s-hohhoꞌi. Jiosh o s-hohhoꞌid mani ahgachug g haꞌichu ahgaj. Dani Jiosh alidag pionag.

GAL01:11	Let me make it clear, my friends, regarding the good news I'm declaring—it did not come from any human being.  	Mt wo chum s-mahchk mo pi ab hu d hemajkam ha amjedkam ihda s-kehg haꞌichu ahga mani am em-ahgid.  
GAL01:12	I didn't receive it from anyone, and nobody taught it to me—it was Jesus Christ who revealed it to me.  	Pi at hedai oꞌodham ni-ahgi o ab ni-mashcha. Do Jiosh alidag mat ab mahsko wua ni-wui. 
GAL01:13	You heard how I behaved as a follower of the Jewish religion—how I fanatically persecuted God's church, savagely trying to destroy it.  	Dani Tuhligo. Kumki heki hu kah mani wa hab masma ab ihm g Jiosh mo g ni-wehm oꞌodham ch si ha shoꞌigchud hegam mo ab ihm g Jesus ch am chum s-keshwuimk g ha-hehemapda.  
GAL01:14	I surpassed my contemporaries in the practice of the Jewish religion because I was so fervently devoted to the traditions of my ancestors. 	Dani wa si s-has haꞌichu am t-himdag ed muꞌi ha baꞌiwechkim g ni-wepo geꞌedam nanid pi baꞌich i s-gewkam oid g t-himdag. 
GAL01:15	But when God (who had set me apart from birth) called me through his grace, and was pleased  	T wabshaba g Jiosh s-ni-hoꞌigeꞌid k am heki hu i apꞌech mant eda koi mahsi mant d wo piongajk.  
GAL01:16	to reveal his Son to me so that I could announce the good news to the nations, I didn't discuss this with anyone.  	T am hebai i cheka.

GAL01:17	I didn't go to Jerusalem to talk to those who preceded me as apostles; instead I left for Arabia, and then later returned to Damascus.  	Ab o dadha g Jesus Christ chuhchai Jerusalem kihhim t ab am Judea jewed ch ed ch am ahgachug g haꞌichu ahgaj. Nt wabshaba pi am hu shaꞌi hih manis hekaj wo ha neid k wo ha wehm neo.

GAL01:19	I didn't see any other apostles except James, the Lord's brother.  	M ant waꞌi hemako ep nei g Jesus kehsha. K heg d James ch d wehngaj g Jesus.  
GAL01:20	(Let me assure you before God that I'm not lying about what I'm writing to you!)  	Jiosh o s-mahch mo d wohokam ihda mani em-ahgid. 
GAL01:21	Then I went to Syria and Cilicia.  	Am i dahm, mant am hahawa ep hih Syria jewed wui ch Cilicia jewed wui.  
GAL01:22	Even so, my face wasn't known to those in the churches of Judea.  	K eda pi ni-mahch hegam mo ab ihm g Jesus ch am kih Judea jewed ch ed.  
GAL01:23	They had only heard people say, “The man who used to persecute us is now spreading the faith he once tried to destroy!”  	Idam wabsh kah mo haꞌi hab kaij, “Hegai mo wa t-shoꞌigchud o am hahawa ahgachug ihda Jesus haꞌichu ahga mo wa heki hu chum s-keshwuimk.”  
GAL01:24	—and they praised God because of me. 	Neh, bash kaij ch ab si ihm g Jiosh am i kaiok mat am gawul i ni-juh. 
GAL02:1	Fourteen years later I returned to Jerusalem with Barnabas. I took Titus along with me.  	Am him k am d i wehst-mahm aꞌahidag, nt am hih Jerusalem wui wehmaj g Barnabas. Tt am hema i bei g gawul mahs oꞌodham. K id hab chehgig Titus.  
GAL02:2	I went because of what God had shown me.  I met with the recognized church leaders there in private and explained to them the good news I was sharing with the foreigners. I didn't want the course I had followed, and what I was working so hard for, to come to nothing.  	Jiosh o wa ab ni-chehgid mant am wo him k wo ha nei hegam mo am d ha wanimeddam g Jesus ihmdam.

GAL02:3-5	But as it turned out, nobody even insisted that Titus who was with me should be circumcised, though he was Greek.  (That issue only arose because some false Christians slipped in to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus, trying to make us slaves.  We never gave into them, not even for a moment. We wanted to make sure to keep the truth of the good news unchanged for you.) 	K am haꞌi haꞌichug hegam mo chum s-em-wupulshpamk ahpim gawul mahs hemajkam hab em-elidch mant hemho wa am hab wo junihid g heki hu t-himdag ahchim Tutuligo.

Neh, bach wa masma s-ap nuhkud ihda s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh mach am em-wui ahgachug. 
GAL02:6	But those considered to be important didn't add anything  to what I said. (It doesn't concern me what kind of leaders they were, because God doesn't judge people the way we do.)  	Do wabsh ni-wehm wohochuddam hegam mo am d ha wanimeddam ch pi haꞌichu wechij ab hu ni-ahgid. Pi ani si has ha elid. Wehsijj ach t-wepo d hahaꞌichu am Jiosh tahgio.  
GAL02:7-8	On the contrary, once they realized that I'd been given responsibility to share the good news with the foreigners just as Peter had been given the responsibility to share the good news with the Jews,  (for the same God  who worked through Peter as apostle to the Jews also worked through me as apostle to the foreigners),  	K hegam hab kaij matki g Jiosh am hab waꞌap i ni-kei hab masma mat am i kei g Peter. Heg o d kehshaj ch am ahgachug g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj ha wui g Tutuligo. Ni ahni hab waꞌap d kehshaj ch am ahgachug ha wui g gawul mahs hemajkam. K g Jiosh wepo ab t-mahkch g gewkdag.  
GAL02:9	and once they recognized the grace that had been given to me, then James, Peter, and John, who bore the responsibility of church leadership, shook Barnabas and me by the hand as their fellow-workers.  	Bamki ha elid hegam James ch Peter ch John mo d ha wanimeddam. T idam am wohokamch mat g Jiosh ab ni-mah ihda chikpan k t-nowi-bebhe. Kutt am i t-apꞌech ab t-wui mat hegam am wo ahgachugad g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga Tutuligo hemajkam ha wui. Nt ahni hi g Barnabas wehm gawul mahs hemajkam ha wui wo ahgachugad.  
GAL02:10	We were to work for the foreigners, while they would work for the Jews. Their only instruction was to remember to look after the poor, something I was already very committed to. 	K hegam hab t-ahg matt wo i ha wehmajk hegam mo d shoꞌigkam am ha shahgid. Am ani wa heki hu hab junihim ch hekaj si chikpan. 
GAL02:11-12	However when Peter came to Antioch I did have to confront him directly, because he was clearly wrong in what he did.  Before some of James' friends arrived, Peter used to eat with the foreigners. But when these people came he stopped doing this and stayed away from the foreigners. He was afraid of being criticized by those who insisted that men had to be circumcised.  	Am ani wa kih Antiok kihhim t am ch am ha ahgid g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. T am jiwia g Peter k am ha wehm oimmed hegam goꞌol hemajkam mat ab i s-wohoch g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh. T am hahawa haꞌi t-wui dada g Tutuligo ab amjed g James. K heg i dahm g Peter pi an hu ha wehm oimmed g goꞌol hemajkam ch pi ha wehm e gegosid no pi s-ehbid mat has wo chei hegam Tutuligo.  
GAL02:13	As well as Peter, other Jewish Christians became hypocritical too, to the extent that even Barnabas was persuaded to follow their hypocrisy. 	K hegam ehp mo hab waꞌap d Tutuligo hab waꞌap e wua mo g Peter, chum wa hems g Barnabas. 
GAL02:14	When I realized that they weren't taking a firm stand for the truth of the good news, I said to Peter in front of everyone, “If you're a Jew yet live like the foreigners and not like Jews, why are you forcing the foreigners to live like Jews?  	Ni am ha neid mo pi am hu shaꞌi ap hab junihim g e-wohochudadag ch hab kaij ab wui g Peter am ha kaichudch, “Neh, Peter, dap Tuhligo ch wabshaba hahawa pi am hu hab junihim hegai t-himdag mo wa g Jiosh ab t-chehani. Pegih, p haschu ahgch hab e elid mapt pi wo ha hajunimak g goꞌol hemajkam, t hoꞌip am hab i junihi g t-chehanig?” 
GAL02:15	We may be Jews by birth, and not ‘sinners’ like the foreigners,  	Ahchim Tutuligo ach wa hab chum t-elid mach pi hab masma pi apꞌe mo g goꞌol hemajkam.  
GAL02:16	but we know that nobody is made right by doing what the law demands—it is only through trusting in Jesus Christ. We have trusted in Christ Jesus so that we could be made right by placing our confidence in Christ, and not through doing what the law says—because nobody is made right by observing the requirements of the law.” 	T wabshaba am i t-chehgi g Jiosh mat pi hedai wo e nako mas am tahgio hejel wo i e apꞌech am hab junihidch g chehanig. Bo d elidaj matt ab wo i s-wohoch g haꞌichu ahgaj k ab wo i hiwigi g Jesus Christ. T heg am tahgio wo i t-apꞌech. Pegih, tt heg am hab waꞌi juh k am i t-apꞌech. 
GAL02:17	For if, as we look to be made right in Christ, we ourselves prove to be sinners, does that then mean that Christ is in the service of sin?  Of course not!  	Am att i s-mai mach d pi ap chuꞌijkam am i s-mahchk ab amjed g Christ. Pi at heg hab t-juh machs d pi ap chuꞌijkam  
GAL02:18	For if I were to rebuild what I've destroyed, then I only demonstrate I'm a law-breaker. 	k wabshaba am i t-apꞌech Jiosh tahgio. Kutt d wo pi ap chuꞌijkamk mattp wo chum s-t-apchudam g chehanigkaj.  
GAL02:19	For through the law I died to the law in order that I could live for God.  	Chehanig o s-hasig. Kutt pi wo t-nako machs am oidk hab wo t-junihid ch am wo i t-apꞌech. Nt heg hekaj am i ni-dagito Jiosh wui mat am wo i ni-apꞌech k am hahawa d wo doakamk wehhejed.  
GAL02:20	I've been crucified with Christ— so it's no longer I who lives, but it is Christ living in me. The life I now live in this body, I live by trusting in the Son of God, who loved me, and who gave himself for me.  	Jiosh alidag o ab si pihk e elid t-hekaj ch ab nako g s-koꞌok muhkig ab kots t ab am t-wehhejed mat heg hekaj ab wo i t-mah g wechij doakag. Kuch heg hekaj ab hiwig ch d dodakam am nenaj ed ch am wehhejed.  
GAL02:21	How could I dismiss God's grace? For if we could be made right through keeping the law then Christ died a pointless death! 	T wabsh wo e nahnkogi g Christ muhkig matp g oꞌodham wo e nako mas wo s-apꞌek am Jiosh nena ed heg wabsh hekaj mo hab junihim g chehanigaj. K wabshaba pi hab chuꞌig.

GAL03:1	You Galatians, you've lost your heads!  Who has put you under a spell? The death of Jesus Christ on a cross was clearly presented to you so you could see!  	Heki am hu kah mat ab muh g Jesus Christ kots t ab am em-wehhejed. Kum d pi haꞌichu aꞌamichuddam mamt ab wo ha kaihamad hegam mo em-iattogid ch hab kaij mamt hab wo junihid g t-chehanig ahchim Tutuligo.  
GAL03:2	So tell me—did you receive the Spirit by keeping the law, or by placing your trust in what you heard?  	Ab amt i s-wohoch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. T g Jiosh ab em-mah g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag.  
GAL03:3	You really have lost your heads! You began living  in the Spirit. Do you really think you can now make yourselves perfect by your own human efforts?

GAL03:5	Let me ask you: does God give you the Spirit and do so many miracles among you because you keep the law, or is it because you trust in what you heard? 	Ab amt si i s-wohoch g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh. T heg hekaj ab em-mah g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag mat wo em-wehmajk k hab ep wua g s-hasig haꞌichu am em-shahgid. Pi at hab ahgk hab e juh ihda mams am hab si junihim g Tutuligo ha-chehanig. 
GAL03:6	It's just like Abraham who “trusted God, and was considered to be right.”  	An o hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed: 
GAL03:8	In Scripture it's foreseen that God would make right the foreigners who trusted in him. The good news is revealed to Abraham beforehand with the words, “Through you all the nations will be blessed.”  	Kekelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam o heki hu s‑mahch ch an oꞌoha mat g Jiosh am hab wo ha juh g goꞌol hemajkam mat ab wo i s‑wohochud k wo i e apꞌech am tahgio. Kush hab kaij g Jiosh am wui g Abrahambad: 
GAL03:10	All those who rely on keeping the law  are under a curse, for as Scripture says, “Cursed is everyone who doesn't carefully obey everything that's written in the book of the law.”  	An o hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed: 
GAL03:11	Clearly nobody is made right with God by attempting to keep the law, for “Those who are made right will live by trusting God.”  	K wabshaba an oꞌohanas: 
GAL03:15	Brothers and sisters, here's an example from daily life. If a contract is drawn up and agreed, signed and sealed, nobody can ignore it or add to it.  	Do t‑himdag matp haꞌi haꞌichu ab aꞌai wo e ahꞌad, t pi hedai wo e nako mas am hejel gawul wo juh.  
GAL03:16	Now the promises were given to Abraham, and to his son. It doesn't say, “sons” as if plural, but singular: “and to your son,” meaning Christ.  	Pegih, k ab si ahꞌad g Jiosh g Abrahambad mat wo ha doꞌibia g nahnko mahs hemajkam am hema gahi wuhshanim g Abrahambad amjedkam. Kuki heg hab ahg Christ.  
GAL03:17	Let me explain. The law, coming four hundred and thirty years later, doesn't cancel the previous covenant that God made, breaking the promise.  	Kut pi shaꞌi gawul juh g haꞌichu e‑ahga g Jiosh mat hekid ab i t‑mah ahchim Tutuligo g t‑chehanig mo idani d waꞌi giꞌik siant waikko wehst‑mahm (430) ahidag amjed.  
GAL03:18	If the inheritance is derived from obedience to the law, it no longer comes from the promise. But God graciously gave it to Abraham by means of the promise. 	Jiosh at wo ha doꞌibia g hemajkam hab masma mat doꞌibia g Abrahambad mat wa hab masma ab ha ahꞌad haꞌichu. Id at wo em‑doꞌibia mamtp ab wo i s‑wohoch, k pi hegai chehanig. 
GAL03:19	What was the point of the law, then? It was added to show what wrongdoing really is, until the son came to whom the promise had been made. The law was put in place by angels through the hand of a mediator.  	K wabshaba am wa haꞌichu wehhejed s‑apꞌe hegai chehanig. Heg o hekaj tasho mo haschu d pi apꞌekam. K hab d elidaj g Jiosh matt an wo uꞌukchid ihda chehanig am hugkam mat in wo i wuhsh g alidaj. Am ash ha ahgid g Jiosh g chehanig am gahi wuhshanim g anghil.  
GAL03:20	But a mediator isn't needed when there's only one person involved. And God is one! 	Kush hema g oꞌodham am ha wehhejed neok g Jiosh ch hemajkam matsh eda am i apꞌech hegai chehanig. Sh wa eda g Jiosh si hejel am ahgid g Abrahambad g haꞌichu e‑ahꞌada. 
GAL03:21	So does the law work against God's promises? Of course not! For if there was a law that could give life, then we could be made right by keeping it.  	Pi o ab hu wui kehk g Jiosh haꞌichu ahꞌada g chehanigaj. Mattp wo sha t‑nako machs wehs oidch am hab wo t‑junihid g Jiosh chehanig, t wabsh wo t‑hiwigi g Jiosh matt heg hekaj wo t‑doꞌibia. K wabshaba pi hab shaꞌi mahs. Heg at hekaj wo t‑doꞌibia g Jiosh mo has i masma ab haꞌichu t‑ahꞌad.  
GAL03:22	But Scripture tells us that we all are prisoners of sin. The only way we can receive God's promises is by trusting in Jesus Christ.  	An o hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed mo wehs hemajkam d pi ap chuꞌijkam ch pi wo shaꞌi e nako mas hejel wo e doꞌibia. T heg hekaj wo ha doꞌibia g Jiosh k ab wo i ha mah g pi ha huhugedam doakag hegam mat ab wo hiwgad g alidaj. 
GAL03:23	Before we trusted in Jesus we remained in the custody of the law until this way of trusting was revealed.  	An o wabsh t‑shohbidch g Jiosh g e‑chehanigkaj am hugkam mat ab i t‑chehgi matt ab wo i s‑wohoch g haꞌichu ahgaj k wo t‑doꞌibia.  
GAL03:24	The law was our guardian until Christ came, so that we could be made right by trusting him.  	T‑mashchamahim o g e‑chehanigkaj matt has wo chum masmak ch ab wo ai matt ab wo i hiw g alidaj. Kut heg am wo i t‑apꞌech Jiosh tahgio mattp ab hiwig.  
GAL03:25	But now this way of trusting Jesus has come, we no longer need such a guardian.  	K hahawa pi d ihda chehanig ch wabshaba d Jiosh alidag mo ab i t‑chehgidch matt has wo chum masmak. 
GAL03:26-27	For you are all God's children through your trust in Christ Jesus.  All of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ.  	E amt pahl wapko mamt am wo e chehgi mamt ab i s‑wohoch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga k ab bei g alidaj. Kum d hahawa aꞌaligaj g Jiosh ch hab wo masmak mo g si alidaj.  
GAL03:28	There's no longer Jew or Greek, slave or free, male or female—you are all one in Christ Jesus.  	K g Jiosh wehs t‑wepo masma t‑neid ahchim mach ab s‑wohochud. Ahpim gawul mahs hemajkam am t‑wepo d haꞌichu ahchim Tutuligo am Jiosh tahgio. K g nenehol t‑wepo d haꞌichu ahchim mach pi d nenehol. K g uꞌuwi t‑wepo d haꞌichu ahchim chechoj. Wehsijj ach ab i t‑hemakochud ahchim mach an uꞌukch g Jesus Christ.  
GAL03:29	If you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's children, and you are heirs of the promise! 	Kuch d hemajkamgaj ch heg hekaj hab waꞌi masma mach d amjedkamaj g Abrahambad ch wo bei hegai mat haschu g Jiosh am i apꞌech wehhejed. 
GAL04:1	Let me explain what I'm saying. An heir who is under-age is no different from a slave, even though the heir may be the owner of everything.  	Chum as wehs d wo enigajk g ali g ohgaj haꞌichu eniga, t eda pi wo bei t hoꞌip am i geꞌeda.  
GAL04:2	An heir is subject to guardians and managers until the time set by the father.  	Mt wo nuhkudad g ali ch ep wo nuhkudad hegai mat haschu d wo enigajk am hugkam mat wo ai g e‑geꞌelig.  
GAL04:3	It's just the same for us. When we were children, we were slaves subject to the basic rules of the law.  	Kuch wa ahchim hab wa masma mo g aꞌal nat pi g Jiosh kei g e‑chehanig mat hekaj wo t‑nuhkud am hugkam matt ab wo i s‑wohoch g haꞌichu ahgaj.  
GAL04:4	But at the appropriate time God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the rule of law,  	T am i s‑ap e ai, t g Jiosh ab i ahꞌad g e‑alidag. Kut ab mahsi k wepo e juh g hemajkam k am i geꞌelhim k am hab junihim hegai chehanig mo g Jiosh ab ha mahkch g Tutuligo.  
GAL04:5	so that he could rescue those who were kept under the rule of law, so that we could receive the inheritance of adopted children. 	Ab ach wa t‑abchud g t‑chuꞌijig ab chehanig wecho. Kut ia jiwia g Jiosh alidag jewed dahm mat wo t‑doꞌibia am t‑wehhejed nakogk g s‑koꞌok t‑namkidadag matt d haha wo aꞌaligajk g Jiosh.  
GAL04:6	To show you are his children, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, causing us to call out, “Abba,” meaning “Father.”  	T g Jiosh heg hekaj ab t‑mah g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag mat wo t‑wehmajk. Kuch hab d aꞌaligaj ch ab ihm ch hab kaij, “Jiosh t‑ohg”.  
GAL04:7	Since you are now no longer a slave, but a child, and if you are his child, then God has made you his heir. 	nach pi hahawa pi d wabsh piongaj. T ab wo i t‑mah g Jiosh mat haschu i apꞌech am t‑wehhejed mach d aꞌaligaj. 
GAL04:8	At the time when you didn't know God, you were enslaved by the supposed “gods” of this world.  	Heki am hu pi mahch g Jiosh ahpim goꞌol hemajkam ch ab haꞌichu e jijoshchud ch ab ha ihm mo eda pi d shaꞌi hegai doakam Jiosh.  
GAL04:9	But now you've come to know God—or better, to be known <span class="it">by</span> God. So how can you go back to those useless and worthless rules? Do you want to be slaves to those rules all over again?  	Pegih, m haschu ahgch am uhpam ha wui ep s‑hihimimk mamt d ep wo ha‑neneholigak hemu mam eda am wa chum s‑mahch g Jiosh.

GAL04:14	Even though my illness was difficult for you, you didn't despise or reject me—in fact you treated me like an angel of God, like Christ Jesus himself. 	M wa eda pi shaꞌi s‑ni‑tamhog ch ab i s‑ni‑hoꞌigeꞌid k i ni‑wahkid k am ni‑nuhkud heg wa wepo mantp d hema anghil o d Jiosh alidag.  
GAL04:15	So what's happened to all your gratefulness? I tell you, back then if you could have pulled out your eyes and given them to me, you would have!  	Ab o wa si geꞌej g pihk em‑elidadag mamtsh chum hems g e‑wuhpui wo ni‑mah heg hekaj pi ni‑apꞌedag.

GAL04:17	These people are keen to gain your support, but not for any good reasons. On the contrary, they want to keep you away from us so that you will enthusiastically support them.

GAL04:22	As Scripture says, Abraham had two sons, one from the servant girl, and one from the free woman.  	Id ant am wo em‑tashogi ab amjed g Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana. 
GAL04:23	However the son from the servant girl was born following a human plan, while the son from the free woman was born as the result of the promise.  	Pi atsh koi bei g e‑mad d Sarabad k eda heki hu okst. Sh wabshaba g Jiosh am ha ahgid mat wo ge madt. Kush ihda madaj d ha‑aliga. Sh wabshaba g Hagarbad mad d ha‑neholiga hab masma mo g jeꞌej. 
GAL04:24-26	This provides an analogy: these two women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai—Hagar—and she gives birth to slave children.  Hagar symbolizes Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the current Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children.  But the heavenly Jerusalem is free. She is our mother. 	Sarabad ani wepogid g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh. Ch ahchim mach ab s‑wohochud wepogidas g Sarabad mad nach pi woho d aꞌaligaj g Jiosh.

Kuch heg wui t‑gewpkadch wehsijj ahchim matt ab i s‑wohoch g Jiosh k am tahgio i t‑apꞌech.  
GAL04:27	As Scripture says, “Rejoice you who are childless and who have never given birth! Shout aloud for joy, you who have never been in labor—for the abandoned woman has more children than the woman who has a husband!”  	An o hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed mash hab kaij g Jiosh: 
GAL04:28	Now my friends, we are children of promise just like Isaac.  	Pegih neh, Isaacbad ash d si ha‑aliga hab masma mash am ha ahgid g Jiosh. Ch ahchim hab wa masma d aꞌaligaj g Jiosh.  
GAL04:29	However just as the one born according to a human plan persecuted the one born through the Spirit, so it is today.  	Heg ash wa shoꞌigchud g Isaacbad mash pi d si ha‑aliga. K hemuch hab waꞌap t‑shoꞌigchud hegam mo pi d aꞌaligaj g Jiosh.  
GAL04:30	But what does Scripture say? “Send away the servant girl and her son, for the son of the servant girl will not be an heir together with the son of the free woman.” 	An o oꞌohadag mash hab kaij g Jiosh ab Abrahambad wui: 
GAL05:1	Christ set us free so we could have real freedom. So stand firm and don't get burdened down again by a yoke of slavery.  	T‑doꞌibia at g Christ. S‑wihnam g an wo uꞌukchid g e doꞌibiadag ch pi ab hu ep wo chum i hiw g chehanig mams hekaj wo e doꞌibia.  
GAL05:2	Let me, Paul, tell you bluntly: if you rely on the way of circumcision, Christ will be of absolutely no benefit to you.  	Mamt wo sha e pahl hikuch hab elidch mamt hekaj wo e doꞌibia am oidch hab e junihidch g chehanig, k d si shel mamtki wabsh dagito g e‑wohochudadag k pi wo e doꞌibia.  
GAL05:3	Let me repeat: every man who is circumcised has to keep the whole of the law.  	Nam woho hab e elid mamt am wo i e apꞌech Jiosh tahgio g pahl hikuchkakaj? Nt wo em‑ahgi mamt hemho wa am wehs oidk hab wo e juh g chehanig mamtp heg hekaj am wo i chum e apꞌech.  
GAL05:4	Those of you who think you can be made right by the law are cut off from Christ—you have abandoned grace. 	Am o s‑em‑apchudamk g Christ. Mt wabshaba gam hu hab wo i juh mamtp hejel chum s‑e apchudamk am oidch hab e wuadch g chehanig.  
GAL05:5	For through the Spirit we trust and wait in hope to be made right.  	Ab o t‑mahkch g gewkdag g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. Kuch hekaj ab wui t‑gewpkadch mat g Jiosh s‑ap am wo i t‑apꞌech e tahgio.  
GAL05:6	For in Christ Jesus being circumcised or uncircumcised doesn't achieve anything; it's only trust working through love that matters.  	Pi o hi wa has chuꞌig matp hema heki hu wo e pahl hikuch o pi wo e pahl hikuch. Do waꞌi ihda mamt ab wo i s‑wohoch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga k wo chehgidch g si pihk e‑elidadag am i ha wehmajch.

GAL05:8	This “persuasion” certainly isn't from the One who calls you.  	Pi o d Jiosh mo im hu hab i em‑wanchshulig ab amjed g wohokam.

GAL05:11	As for me, brothers and sisters, if I were still advocating circumcision—why am I still persecuted? If that was true, it would remove the issue of the cross that offends people so much.  	Haꞌi o hab kaij mani ahni ahgachug mamt am hab wo junihid g t‑chehanig ch hekaj wo s‑apꞌek am Jiosh nena ed. T wabshaba pi wo chum ni‑muꞌam g ni‑wehm oꞌodham mantp heg wo ahgachugad.

GAL05:13	You, my brothers and sisters, were called to freedom! Just don't use your freedom as an excuse to indulge your sinful human nature—instead serve one another in love.

GAL05:14	For the whole law is summed up in this one command, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.”  	Bo chuꞌig g Jiosh oꞌohana: 
GAL05:16-17	My advice is to walk by the Spirit. Don't satisfy the desires of your sinful human nature.  For the desires of the sinful nature are opposed to the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are opposed to the sinful nature. They fight one another, so you don't do what you want to do.  	Pi o wepo chuꞌig g oꞌodham tatchui ch Jiosh tatchui. Kumt ab wo e dagitokchid Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag wui. T heg ab wo em‑shohbidad ch wo i em‑wanimedad.

GAL06:8	If you sow according to your sinful human nature, from that nature you'll reap self-destruction. But if you sow according to the Spirit, from the Spirit you'll reap eternal life.

GAL06:12-13	Those people who only want to make a good impression are forcing you to be circumcised just so they won't be persecuted for the cross of Christ.  Even those who are circumcised don't keep the law, but they want to have you circumcised so that they can boast about you and claim you as their followers.

HEB01:3	The Son is the radiant glory of God, and the visible expression of his true character. He sustains everything by his powerful command. When he had provided cleansing for sin he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven.  	Kutsh eda ia jiwia k e shoꞌigchud k e muhkid matsh gam hu hab wo i juh g s-koꞌok t-namkidadag mach d pi ap chuꞌijkam. Tsh g Jiosh ab hahawa uhpam ep i be k an dai si e-hugid an.

HEB02:6-7	But as it's been said, “What are human beings that you should worry about them? What is a son of man  that you should care about him?  You set him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and placed him over all your creation.  	Neh, an o hebai hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed mash hema hab kaij ab Jiosh wui: 
HEB02:10	It was appropriate that God, who creates and maintains everything, should bring many of his children to glory, and to completely prepare through suffering the one who leads them to salvation.

HEB02:17	That's why it was necessary for him to become like his brothers in everything, so that he could become a merciful and trustworthy high priest in the things of God, to forgive his people's sins.  	Tsh heg wa hekaj am t‑wepo e juh k t‑wepo masma ia oimmelhim ch haꞌichu nakog. Bat waꞌi masma s‑ap d wo t‑uhgchu pahligk ch ab wo s‑t‑hoꞌigeꞌidad ch gam hu hab wo i juh g t‑chuꞌijig am wehhejed g Jiosh.  
HEB02:18	Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted. 	Jiawul o chum t‑chehani matt hab wo juh g pi apꞌekam. K wabshaba g Jesus s‑ap e nakog mat am wo i t‑gewkemhunad nash pi hab waꞌap nakog mash wa g Jiawul chum chehani g pi apꞌekam. 
HEB03:1	So, my brothers and sisters who live for God and who share in this heavenly calling, we need to think carefully about Jesus—the one we say is sent by God,  and is the High Priest.  	Pegih, ni‑wehm wohochuddam, ab at i em‑gawulkai g Jiosh gahi wuhshanim g e‑alidag Jesus. Heg o d Jiosh si Kehsha ch d uhgchu t‑pahlig. Kumt wo oidahid mo has chuꞌig.  
HEB03:2	He was faithful to God in the work he was chosen to do, just like Moses was faithful to God in God's house. 	Jiosh atsh heki hu am i kei g Mosesbad ha dahm g e‑hemajkamga. Kush heg s‑ap am hab junihim g e‑chikpan. Pegih, sh g Jesus hab waꞌap s‑ap am hab junihim g e‑chikpan am Jiosh wehhejed.  
HEB03:3-4	But Jesus deserves much greater glory than Moses, in the same way that the builder of a house deserves more credit than the house.  Every house has its builder; God is the builder of everything.  	Kutt wabshaba baꞌich ab wo i si has elidad g Jesus mach g Mosesbad no pi d Jiosh ch wehs haꞌichu nahto.  
HEB03:5	As a servant, Moses was faithful in God's house. He provided evidence of what would be announced later.  	Mosesbad ash s‑ap am hab junihim g e‑chikpan am ha shahgid g Jiosh hemajkamga ch wabshaba d wabsh Jiosh pionag. Tsh g Jiosh am i kei matsh wo haꞌichu aꞌaga wehhejed matsh gam hu baꞌich hahawa s‑ap wo i e tashogit.  
HEB03:6	But Christ is a son, in charge of God's house. And we are God's house as long as we hold on with confidence to the hope we boast we believe in. 	Kush eda g Jesus d Jiosh alidag ch d si kehshaj matsh wehs am wo ha dahmkad g hemajkamgaj. Kuch ahchim d hemajkamgaj mattp pi wo dagito g t‑wohochudadag k wabsh s‑ap t‑tahtkk ch wo nenida mat hab wo t‑juni mo has i kaij. 
HEB03:7	This is why the Holy Spirit says, “If you hear what God is saying to you today,  	Neh, bash masma hab chuꞌig am t‑wehhejed mash wa hab chuꞌig am ha wehhejed g t‑shohshonbad ahchim Tutuligo. Hegam ha wui ash hab kaij g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag: 
HEB03:12	Brothers and sisters, make sure that none of you has an evil mindset that's given up trusting in the God of life.  	Neh, tsh wa woho hab e juh g Jiosh neꞌoki am ha wehhejed. Kumt heg hekaj wo s‑e nenꞌeidad mamt pi hab masma wo pi chechkaidagk. Jiosh o d doakam ch woho gam hu hab wo i em‑juh mamtp pi ab hu wo kaihamad.  
HEB03:13	Encourage each other every day while you still have “today,” so that none of you will be deceived by sin and become hard-hearted.  	Ab o t‑waid g Jiosh hemu ch wabshaba pi chum hekid ab wo t‑waidad. Mt wo e iattogi g pi apꞌekamkaj mamtp pi ab hu wo kaihamad g Jiosh. Ab g aꞌai wo i e gewkemhunad mamt ab wo kaihamad.  
HEB03:14	For we are partners with Christ as long as we hold on to our confidence in God from beginning to end. 	Dach s‑wohom Christ hemajkamga mattp an wo si uꞌukchid g t‑wohochudadag wehs t‑doakag oidam.  
HEB03:15	As Scripture says, “If you hear what God is saying to you today, don't harden your hearts like the time you rebelled against him.”  	Mt heg hekaj wo s‑chegitok ihda mani am em‑ahgid ch pi wo pi chechkaidagk hab masma mash wa hegam mash pi ab hu wohog elid g Jiosh. 
HEB03:16	Who was it that rebelled against God, even though they heard what he said? Wasn't it all those who were led out of Egypt by Moses?  	Jiosh atsh wa am ha doꞌibia ab ha amjed g Egypt t am hemajkam am gahi wuhshanim g Mosesbad. Kush eda hahawa pi chechkaidag.  
HEB03:17-18	Who was God upset with for forty years? Wasn't it those who sinned, those who were buried in the desert?  Who was God speaking of when he vowed they should not enter into his rest? Wasn't it those who disobeyed him?  	Sh g Jiosh s‑ha kehꞌid ch hab kaij matsh pi wo ha hiwigi mas am wo i wahp amai mash hebai am chum apꞌechudch ha wehhejed k hoꞌip wehs koi hegam geꞌeged mash pi ab hu wohog elid. Kush heg hekaj am oiopo tohono jewed ch ed giꞌikko wehst‑mahm (40) aꞌahid ab.  
HEB03:19	So we see that they were not able to enter because they didn't trust him. 	Neh, id o am t‑chehgidch matki heg hekaj pi am hu ha wahpki g Jiosh heg eda jewed mash pi ab hu wohochud. 
HEB04:1-2	Therefore let's take care to make sure that even though God has given us his promise of entering his rest, none of you miss out!  For we've heard the good news just like they did, but it didn't help them because they didn't accept and trust in what they heard.  	Kutki heg hekaj pi am hu ha apꞌet g Jiosh waida. Kutt ahchim wo s‑t‑gihugad matt pi hab wo masmak mash wa hegam. Jiosh ash am t‑wehhejed apꞌechudch e‑kihdag ed hab sha masma mash wa am ha wehhejed chum apꞌechudch hegai jewed.  
HEB04:3	However those of us who trust in God <span class="it">have</span> entered into that rest God mentioned when he said, “In my frustration I vowed, ‘They shall not enter my rest.’ ” (This is so even though God's plans were already complete when he created the world).  	Id ash am apꞌechudas ged hu i amjed matsh am e nahto g jewed. Sh wabshaba hab masma hab chuꞌig am t‑wehhejed mash wa hab chuꞌig am ha wehhejed. Jiosh ash hab kaij matsh pi hedai am hu wo i wah pi ab hu wohochudch k wabshaba ab wo bei g s‑koꞌok e‑namkidadag. Kutt heg hekaj ab wo s‑wohochudad ch hab s‑ap am wo i wahp kihdaj ed am i t‑pihhunk ia jewed dahm. 
HEB04:6	God's rest is still there for some to enter, even though those who previously heard the good news failed to enter because of disobedience.  	Hegam mat ab wo s‑wohoch g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh atsh am wo i wahp Jiosh kihdag ed. 
HEB04:7-8	So God again sets a day—today—saying a long time later through David as he did before, “If you hear what God is saying to you today, don't harden your hearts.”  For if Joshua had been able to give them rest, God wouldn't have spoken later about another day.  	Tsh wabshaba g ha‑aꞌaliga am i wahp. Tsh g Joshuabad am i ha wanim. Kush ab ha wui hab hahawa kaij g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ihda mani wa am em‑ahgid: 
HEB04:12	For God's word is alive and effective, sharper than any twin-edged sword, so penetrating it separates life and breath, bone joints and their marrow, judging the thoughts and intentions of the mind.  	Shoꞌo waꞌi si s‑gewkdag g Jiosh neꞌoki. K g Jiosh heg hekaj am chehgidch mo has chuꞌig g t‑doakag ch t‑chegitoidag. Bo masma g neꞌokij mo g s‑muꞌuk wainomi mamtp hems heg hekaj ged hu wo si hikuch g chuhkug ch ohꞌo k wo cheh mo haschu ged hu si eda.  
HEB04:13	No living being is hidden from his sight; everything is exposed and visible to the one we're accountable to. 	Pi att wo shaꞌi t‑nako machs haschu gam hu wo ehsto ab amjed g Jiosh. Wehs o haꞌichu s‑mahch. Kutt hemho wa hema tash am wo gegokiwua baꞌich k wehs wo ah g t‑chuꞌijig. 
HEB04:14	Since we have such a great high priest who has ascended to heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us make sure we hold on to what we say we believe.  	Do si uhgchu t‑pahlig ch d Jiosh alidag g Jesus ch an i wah Jiosh kihdag ed am t‑wehhejed. Kutt heg hekaj ab wo s‑wohochudad chum hekid.  
HEB04:15	For the high priest we have isn't one who doesn't sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who was tempted in all the ways we are, but did not sin.  	Ihda uhgchu t‑pahlig o si pihk e elid t‑hekaj natsh pi ab nakog k s‑mahch hegai mach ahchim ab nakog. Jiawul ash hab waꞌap chum chehani mat hab wo juh hegai mo haschu pi d Jiosh tatchui hab masma mo hemu ab t‑chehani. Kush wabshaba s‑ap ab wui kehk ch pi hekid hab juh g pi apꞌekam.  
HEB04:16	So we should go confidently to God on his throne of grace so we can receive mercy, and discover grace to help us when we really need it. 	Pegih, ab o t‑kaiham g Jiosh no pi g alidaj d uhgchu t‑pahlig ch si pihk e elid t‑hekaj. Kutt heg hekaj s‑ap wo t‑nako matt ab wo tahnid g i wehmtadag ch pi wo ehbidad. T heg ab wo i s‑t‑hoꞌigeꞌid k ab wo i t‑wehmt. 
HEB05:1-3	Every high priest is chosen from the people and is appointed to work for the people as they relate to God. He presents to God both their gifts and sacrifices for their sins.  The high priest understands how ignorant and deluded people feel because he also experiences the same kind of human weaknesses.  As a result he has to offer sacrifices for his sins as well as for those of the people.  	Jiosh atsh am i apꞌech matsh hema g t‑wehm oꞌodham d wo uhgchu t‑pahligk ch ab wui hab wo junihid g iagchulida ch hoꞌigeꞌidahuna am t‑wehhejed ch hejel e wehhejed. Kut id hemho wo wa chum s‑hemajimak ab t‑wui no pi hab waꞌap d oꞌodham ch hebai hab wua g pi apꞌekam. 
HEB05:4	No one can take the position of high priest for himself; he must be chosen by God, just like Aaron was.  	Pi atsh hedai am wabsh wo hejel i e kei mat d wo uhgchu pahlk. Jiosh atsh am wo i kei hab masma matsh wa hab juh g Aaronbad ged hu i heki hu matsh g amjedkamaj d wo papalk.  
HEB05:5	In just the same way Christ did not honor himself by becoming high priest. It was God who said to him, “You are my Son. Today I have become your Father.”  	Tsh hab wa masma pi am hu wabsh hejel i e kei g Christ. Jiosh atsh wa am i kehsh k ab wui hab kaij: 
HEB05:7	Jesus, while he was here in human form, prayed and appealed with loud cries and tears to God, the one who was able to save him from death. Jesus was heard because of his respect for God.  	Kush g Jesus ab wui e hoꞌigeꞌidahun ch shoak ch iawua g e‑ohꞌog mash eda ia oimmed ch ab aihim g muhkig. Kush g Jiosh ab kaiham nash pi heg si s‑hemajima ch ab si has elid.  
HEB05:8	Even though he was God's Son, Jesus learned practically the meaning of obedience through suffering.  	Dash Jiosh hab elida matsh wo e shoꞌigchud k wo e muhkid am t‑wehhejed. Kutsh wa woho hab e juh k hab masma s‑mai g wohog elidadag, chum as d Jiosh alidag.  
HEB05:9	When his experience was complete, he became the source of eternal salvation to everyone who does what he says,  	Bat wa masma am i apꞌech g Jiosh mat hab wo juh g pi ha huhugedam doꞌibiadag wehsijj t‑wehhejed mattp hedai ab wo s‑wohog el.  
HEB05:10	having been designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek. 	Kush hab kaij g Jiosh mat am i kei mat d wo uhgchu pahlk hab masma mat am i kei g Melkisedek. 
HEB05:11	We have much to say about Jesus, and it's hard to explain because you don't seem able to understand!  	Muꞌi ani haꞌichu chum s‑em‑mashchamimk ab amjed g Christ id hekaj Melkisedek. Mt wabshaba pi wo amich.  
HEB05:12	By now you should have had enough time to become teachers, but you need someone to teach you the fundamentals, the first principles of God's word. It's like you need to go back to baby milk instead of solid food!  	Idani amki tash d Jiosh wohochuddam ch hab wo chum chuꞌigk mamt haꞌi ep wo ha mashcha. Kumtki eda koi si s‑ap s‑mai g wehpeg mashchama. Bam sha masma mam d wabsh kia al hahaꞌas aꞌal ch hegai waꞌi wihbi ihꞌe  
HEB05:13	Those who drink baby milk don't have the experience of living the right way—they're just babies.  	nam pi pi amichud g Jiosh neꞌoki ab amjed g s‑apꞌekam.  
HEB05:14	Solid food is for grown-ups—those who by always using their brains have learned to tell the difference between good and evil. 	Hegam mat wo geꞌegeꞌehogat e‑wohochudadag ed at wo s‑amich g Jiosh neꞌoki k wo s‑mahchk mo haschu d s‑apꞌekam ch haschu d pi apꞌekam. 
HEB06:1	So let's not get stuck on the basic teachings about Christ, but let's progress to a more mature understanding. We don't need to go over again the ideas of repenting from what we used to do, about trusting in God—  	Gd hu i si wehpeg att am em‑mashcha mamt gam hu wo s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegitoi k ab wo i s‑wohoch g Jiosh  
HEB06:2	or teachings about baptism, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.  	k wo e pahl wapko. T g Jiosh ab wo i em‑wuwhas muhkig t amjed k pi wo em‑lodai. Kutt heki hu em‑mashcha mamt ab wo ha taht hegam mat hab waꞌap ab wo i s‑wohoch g Jiosh k wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahu am ha wehhejed. Kut ab wo bei g gewkdaj g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag hab masma mamt ahpim.  
HEB06:3	So let's get on with it, as God gives us the opportunity! 	Id o d hema hegam wehpeg mashchama am t‑wohochudadag ed. K wabshaba haꞌichu d ep hegai mamt ep wo s‑mai. Mt heg hekaj pi heg wo waꞌi aꞌagad mo d si shondaj g t‑wohochudadag. 
HEB06:4	It's impossible for those who once understood and experienced God's heavenly gift—who shared in receiving the Holy Spirit,  	Pi at wo e nako hegam mat wo s‑mahchk g Jiosh ch wo dagito mas gam hu ep wo s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegito k ep wo bei g wechij doakag. Heki o hu ha tonlid g Jiosh g ha‑amichudadag. K g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag am ha eda chikpan. Kut chum bei ihda wechij doakag  
HEB06:5	who had known God's good word and the power of the coming age—  	k chum s‑mahch mo g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga s‑apꞌe ch neid g Jiosh gewkdag  
HEB06:6	and then completely abandon God, for them to be brought back to repentance once more. They themselves have crucified the Son of God all over again and publicly humiliated him.  	ch wabshaba wehs dagito ihda heg hekaj pi apꞌekam. Heg o wa wepo mat ab ep sisish g Jiosh alidag kots t ab k si edawua am ep i e nohnogidk pi apꞌekam wui. Kut pi wo shaꞌi e nako mas gam hu ep wo s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegitoi. 
HEB06:7-8	Land that has been watered by rain, and produces crops for those who farm it, has God's blessing.  But land that only produces weeds and thorns is worthless, and is about to be condemned. In the end all that can be done is to burn it. 	Neh, no hig pi woho mam hab elid g e‑eꞌes mat chum s‑kehg wo bahidagt mat hekid wo juh. Kumt wo dagito hegai oidag mat wabsh g hoꞌi wo i wuhshad. Pegih, t hab wa masma wo em‑dagito g Jiosh mamtp pi haꞌichu wehhejed wo s‑kehgajk.  
HEB06:9	But dear friends, we believe better of you and your salvation, even if we talk like this!  	Ni wabshaba hab em‑elid mamt woho e doꞌibia k hab masma ab baꞌich wo i bei g Jiosh hoꞌigeꞌidadag.  
HEB06:10	God wouldn't be so unjust as to forget what you've done and the love you've shown for him by the care you've shown for fellow-believers—something you're still doing.  	S‑ap am haꞌichu hab junihim ha wehhejed g e‑wehm wohochuddam ch hab wabsh kia junihim nam pi si pihk e elid ha hekaj. T g Jiosh wo s‑chegito hegai mam haschu hab junihim.  
HEB06:11	We want each of you to show the same kind of commitment, confident in God's hope until it's fulfilled.  	Tatchua ani mamt hab wa masma am hab wo junihid wehs e‑doakag oidam ch ab wo ai hegai mo g Jiosh ab t‑makiog hahawa.  
HEB06:12	Don't be spiritually lazy, but follow the example of those who through trusting in God and patience inherit what God has promised.  	Hegam mash wa heki hu ab s‑wohochud g Jiosh ash s‑bahbagi ab nenida mat hab wo ha juni mash haschu hab kaij mat hab wo juh. Kumt ahpim hab wo wa masmak. 
HEB06:13	When God gave his promise to Abraham he could swear by no one greater so he took an oath on himself,  	Jiosh ash wa am si ahg g t‑shohshonbad Abraham mash haschu ab t‑makiog  
HEB06:14	saying, “I will definitely bless you, and multiply your descendants.”  	ab wui hab kaijch: 
HEB06:16	People swear on things that are greater than they are, and when they have some dispute the oath is taken as the final word on the matter.  	Neh, s‑mahch ach mat am Jiosh tahgio aꞌai wo i apꞌech g hemajkam mat woho hab wo juh g haꞌichu e‑ahga.  
HEB06:17	That's why God wanted to demonstrate more clearly to those who would inherit the promise that he would never ever change his mind.  	Pegih, t g Jiosh am hejel e tahgio i apꞌech g haꞌichu e‑ahga Abrahambad wui no pi pi hedai baꞌich i geꞌej mas am tahgio wo i apꞌech. Bo masma am t‑chehgidch ahchim mach ab s‑wohochud mat pi hekid am gawul wo juh g hab e‑elida.  
HEB06:18	So by these two actions that can't be changed, and since it's impossible for God to lie, we can have total confidence, having run for safety to take hold of the hope God presented to us.  	Kutt heg hekaj ab wo t‑gewkemhunad mat s‑ap wo nahto g t‑doꞌibiadag.  
HEB06:19-20	This hope is our spiritual anchor—it's both certain and reliable, and it takes us past the curtain to the presence of God.  That's where Jesus went in on our behalf, because he had become a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek. 	Jesus atsh am heki hu i wah dahm kahchim ch ed. Kuch heg hekaj s‑mahch mat am wo i t‑wahpki ahchim mach ab s‑wohochud. Jiosh atsh am i kei matsh d wo uhgchu t‑pahligk chum hekid. Pi ash heg hekaj d pahl mas d papal ha amjedkam. Jiosh atsh am i kei hab masma matsh wa heki hu am i kei hegai mash hab chehgig Melkisedek. 
HEB07:1	Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of the Most High God. He met Abraham who was returning from defeating the kings and blessed him.  	Nt wo haꞌichu em‑ahgi ab amjed hegai Melkisedekbad mant wo em‑tashogi g Jesus chikpan. Jiosh atsh am i kei g Melkisedekbad. Kush d kownal am Salem kihhim ch ed ch d ep pahl. 
HEB07:2	Abraham gave him a tithe of all that he had won. Melchizedek's name means “king of right” while king of Salem means “king of peace.”  	Tsh g Abrahambad ab mah mo haschu ab d wuikamaj g Jiosh mash d hemako tahpna mo wehst‑mahm e tahpanch g gehgewadaj. 
HEB07:3	We don't have any information about his father or his mother or his family tree. We don't know when he was born or when he died. Like the Son of God he continues as a priest forever. 	Pi o an hu hebai oꞌohanas mas hedai d ha‑amjedkam g Melkisedekbad ch has masma mahsi k has masma heb hu hih. K id am t‑chehgidch mat has masma in wo i wuhsh g Jiosh alidag ab dahm kahchim t amjed k am uhpam ep wo him k d wo uhgchu pahlk chum hekid. 
HEB07:4	Think how great this man was for Abraham the patriarch to give him a tithe of what was won in battle.  	Melkisedekbad oki baꞌich d i si s‑has haꞌichu mo g Abrahambad. Tsh heg ab mah g hemako tahpna mo wehst‑mahm e tahpanch g gehgewadaj matsh am ui cheggiadag ed  
HEB07:5	Yes, the sons of Levi who are priests were commanded by the law to receive a tithe from the people, their brothers and sisters, who are descended from Abraham.  	K hab chuꞌig g t‑chehanig matsh hegam t‑wehm oꞌodham mo d Levibad amjedkam ch d papal ab t‑amjed wo ui hegai hemako tahpna matsh wehst‑mahm wo e tahpanch g t‑gehgewadag.  
HEB07:6	But Melchizedek who doesn't share their ancestry received tithes from Abraham, and blessed the one who had God's promises.  	Kush ihda Melkisedekbad pi d Levibad amjedkam. Tsh eda g Abrahambad ab namkid hegai mo d Jiosh wuikam. Tsh g Melkisedekbad ab i s‑hoꞌigeꞌel.  
HEB07:7	There's no argument that the lesser person is blessed by the one who is greater.  	Kuch s‑mahch mat g geꞌechu ab wo s‑hoꞌigeꞌel g chumchu. K heg hekaj baꞌich i geꞌej g Melkisedekbad mo g Abrahambad. 
HEB07:8	In the one case tithes are received by men who die, but in the other by one who is said to be living.  	Melkisedekbad o baꞌich d i si s‑has haꞌichu mo g t‑papalig. Hegam o wabsh koꞌihim. K wabshaba pi an hu hebai oꞌohanas mat muh g Melkisedekbad.  
HEB07:9	So you could say that Levi, the one who receives tithes, has paid tithes through being a descendant of Abraham,  	K heg wa wepo mat g t‑papalig ha‑shohshonbad Levi am namkid g Melkisedekbad  
HEB07:10	for he was yet to be born from his father when Melchizedek met Abraham. 	nash pi ab d Abrahambad amjedkam mash heg am namkid.  
HEB07:11	Now if perfection could have been achieved through the priesthood of Levi (for that's how the law was received), what was the need for another priest to come following the order of Melchizedek, and not following the order of Aaron?  	Jiosh atsh am i ha chuhcha g Levibad amjedkam matsh d wo t‑papaligk ch ab wo t‑mah g chehanigaj. T wabshaba pi wo shaꞌi e nako g t‑papalig mas am wo i t‑apꞌech g Jiosh wehhejed. Tsh heg hekaj ab hema ep i wuhsh mash gawul masma mo hegam ch wepo masma g Melkisedekbad.  
HEB07:12	If the priesthood is changed, then the law needs to be changed too.  	Kut hemho wa am gawul juh g Jiosh g e‑chehanig mat am wo i kei g Jesus mat d wo t‑pahligk.  
HEB07:13-14	The one we're talking about comes from a different tribe, a tribe that has never provided priests to serve at the altar.  It's clear that our Lord is a descendant of Judah, and Moses said nothing about priests coming from this tribe.  	Heg ash pi ab hu d Levibad amjedkam ch wabshaba ab d Judabad amjedkam matsh idam pi d wo chum papalk am t‑chehanig ed. K heg hekaj tasho mat g Jiosh am gawul juh g e‑chehanig am t‑wehhejed. 
HEB07:15	What makes it even clearer is when another priest appears who is similar to Melchizedek,  	Neh, baꞌich ant am wo i em‑tashogi mo g Jesus pi ha wepo masma g t‑papalig ch wabshaba wepo masma g Melkisedekbad.  
HEB07:16	and who didn't become a priest by virtue of his human ancestry but by the power of a life that cannot be ended.  	Pi atsh e pahlch g t‑chehanigkaj k wabshaba e pahlch g gewkdajkaj g e‑doakag. K g doakaj d pi ha huhugedam. 
HEB07:17	That's why it says, “You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.” 	Heg o hekaj ab amjed oꞌohanas mash ab wui hab kaij g Jiosh: 
HEB07:18-19	So the previous rule has been set aside because it was powerless and didn't work,  (for the law didn't make anything perfect). But now it's been replaced by a better hope by which we can come close to God.  	Kut heg am i t‑apꞌech Jiosh tahgio mach ab hahawa s‑ap miabid. Heki hu t‑chehanig o pi ab hu shaꞌi t‑mahkch g gewkdag machs hekaj am wo i t‑apꞌech Jiosh wehhejed. Kut hekaj g Jiosh gam hu hab i juh. 
HEB07:20	This  was not without an oath, even though those who become priests do so without an oath.  	Jiosh ash hab wabsh kaij matsh g Levibad amjedkam d wo papalk  
HEB07:21	But he became a priest with an oath because God told him, “The Lord has taken a solemn vow and will not change his mind: You are a priest forever.”  	ch wabshaba g e‑gewkdagkaj hab kaij ab wui g Jesus: 
HEB07:23	There have been many priests because death prevented them from being able to continue;  	Hegam Levibad amjedkam at pi wo e nako mas d wo papalk chum hekid no pi koꞌihim.  
HEB07:24	but since Jesus lives forever, his priesthood is permanent.  	T wabshaba g Jesus chum hekid d wo doakamk. T hab pi hedai ep am kehkud ed wo i kekiwua.  
HEB07:25	As a result he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, living always to plead their case on their behalf. 	Kut wo e nako mat wehs wo ha doꞌibia hegam mat am gahi wuhshanim ab wo i e nohnogi Jiosh wui nat pi chum hekid d wo doakamk ch am ha wehhejed ab wo tahnid g Jiosh mat am wo i ha wehmt. 
HEB07:26	He is exactly the high priest we need: holy and without fault, pure and separate from sinners, and given a place in the highest heavens.  	Tatchua ach g si s‑ap uhgchu pahl. K g Jesus woho hab masma ch d hekia s‑apꞌekam ch i e gawulkadch ab ha amjed g pi apꞌekam. Idani o an daha Jiosh wehm an dahm kahchim ch ed.  
HEB07:27	Unlike those human high priests, he doesn't need to offer a daily sacrifice for his sins and then the sins of the people. He did this once, and for everyone, when he offered himself.  	Pi o wepo masma hegam mo d uꞌugchu papal am heki hu t‑chehanig ed.

T wabshaba g Jesus hejel am i e dagito mat hekaj ab wo iagchul.  
HEB07:28	The law appoints imperfect men as high priests, but God gave his solemn vow after the law, and appointed his Son, perfect forever. 	Hegam mo d papal ab heki hu t‑chehanig wecho o pi d shaꞌi hekiakam ch pi ap wo nahto g e‑chikpan. T wabshaba g Jiosh am hahawa i kei g e‑alidag g hejel e‑gewkdagkaj. K heg d uhgchu t‑pahlig ch d si hekiakam. Pi at hekid wo huhug g gewkdaj. T hab s‑ap wo nahto g e‑chikpan. 
HEB08:1	The main point of what we're saying is this: We have just such a high priest who is seated at the right hand of God, who sits in majesty on his throne in heaven.  	Neh, bo wa masma d uhgchu pahl g Jesus mant am i em‑tashogi. Kush g Jiosh ab si has elid ch am e wehm dahshch e‑kownal daikud ed.  
HEB08:2	He serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle that was set up by the Lord and not by human beings.  	Jiosh kihdag o si s‑wohom d geꞌe cheopi ch pi d wabsh hemajkam ha‑nahtoi. K heg eda am chikpan ihda si s‑wohom uhgchu t‑pahlig. 
HEB08:3	Since it's the responsibility of every high priest to offer gifts and sacrifices, this high priest must also have something to offer. 	Uꞌugchu papal at ab haꞌichu wo chum iagchul Jiosh wui am wehhejed g pi ap ha‑chuꞌijig g hemajkam. T id hab waꞌap wo wa juh g Jesus.  
HEB08:4	Now if he was here on earth, he wouldn't be a priest at all, because there are already priests to present the offerings that the law requires.  	K eda pi hiwgidas mas hab wo juh ia jewed dahm no ge d Levibad amjedkam. Do waꞌi idam mo am t‑himdag chehanig ed hab wua g chuꞌijig iagchulida.  
HEB08:5	The place they serve is a copy, a mere shadow of what is in heaven. That's what God told Moses when he was going to set up the tabernacle: “Be careful to make everything according to the blueprint you were shown on the mountain.” 	K eda g ha‑chikpan wabsh t‑chehgidch g Jiosh kihdag ch hegai si s‑wohom chuꞌijig iagchulida. 
HEB08:6	But Jesus has been given a far better ministry just as he is the one who mediates a far better agreed relationship between us and God, which is based on much better promises.  	Neh, hegam uꞌugchu papal o am i chum ha wehmt g hemajkam heg hekaj heki hu hab elidaj g Jiosh. K wabshaba ihda wechij haꞌichu hab elidaj baꞌich i s‑kehgaj no pi g Jiosh baꞌich i s‑kehg haꞌichu ab t‑makiog. K g Jesus baꞌich i s‑ap i t‑wehmt heg hekaj.  
HEB08:7	If that first agreement had been perfect, then a second wouldn't have been necessary.  	Pi at am hu hab wo juh g wechij apchuda g Jiosh matp g hekiukam s‑ap am wo i t‑apꞌech wehhejed.  
HEB08:8	Pointing out their failings, God told his people, “Pay attention, says the Lord, because the days are coming when I will make a new agreement relating to the house of Israel and the house of Judah.  	Neh, bash kaij g Jiosh: 
HEB09:1	The former system had instructions as to how to worship, and an earthly sanctuary.  	Am o apchudas heg eda heki hu chehanig mat has masma g hemajkam ab has wo elidad g Jiosh ch am ep apchudas mat g hemajkam am wo i kei g ikus kih mat hab d wo ahgak.  
HEB09:2	The first room in the tabernacle housed the candlestick, the table, and the sacred bread. This was called the Holy Place.  	Id ash wa an e eda kuhpi. K hegai wehpeg kih hab e aꞌaga ‘Hekia S‑apꞌekam Kih.’ Sh id eda am haꞌichug g lalampa chuhchakud ch mihsa. Sh heg ab mihsa g papal am doꞌaw g pahn ch hekaj ab si has elid g Jiosh.  
HEB09:3	Past the second veil in the tabernacle was the room called the Most Holy Place.  	Kush hegai hema ep kih hab e aꞌaga ‘Si Hekia S‑apꞌekam Kih.’  
HEB09:4	This contained the golden altar of incense, the gold-covered “agreement chest.”  Inside this were the golden pot containing manna, Aaron's rod that had produced buds, and the stone inscriptions of the agreement. 	Id ash eda am haꞌichug g ohla iagchulidakud. Kush id ab g papal an memheid g s‑ap uhw haꞌichu. Kush am ep haꞌichug hegai uhs washa mash d chehgida mach d chum Jiosh hemajkamga ahchim Tutuligo.

Kush wa am ep e toꞌakch hegai gohk koꞌokmalk hohodai mo an ab oꞌohanas g Jiosh chehanig.  
HEB09:5	Above this were the glorious angel cherubim covering the place of reconciliation. We can't discuss all of this in detail now. 	An dahm ihda uhs washa ash an nahtois g gohk anghil ch ab e wui gegok ch g e‑aꞌankaj am ehkchulidch matsh hebai wo e iawua g ehꞌedaj g ha‑iagchulida. Id ash am e iawua matsh hekaj g Jiosh wo s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌid k gam hu hab wo i juh g ha‑chuꞌijig. Pi ant am hu wo kia wehs haꞌichu t tashogi ab amjed ihda. 
HEB09:6	Once all of this had been set up, the priests would go in regularly to the first room of the tabernacle to perform their duties.  	Neh, bash wa masma wehs apchudas idam haꞌichu. Sh g papal am i wahpk wehpeg kih ch ed wehs tashkaj ch am hab wua g e‑chikpan.  
HEB09:7	But only the high priest went into the second room, and only once a year. Even then he had to make a sacrifice involving blood, which he offered for himself and for the people's sins of ignorance. 	Kush wabshaba heg waꞌi si uhgchu pahl ged hu i wapke heg eda baꞌich kih hemho ahid ab. Kush g haꞌichu doakam ehꞌed am iagchulid Jiosh wui am wehhejed g e‑chuꞌijig ch ha‑chuꞌijig g hemajkam matp hems am hab juh pi mahchch mo d pi ap chuꞌijig.  
HEB09:8	By this the Holy Spirit indicated that the way into the true Most Holy Place hadn't been revealed while the first tabernacle still existed. 	Hegai Si Hekia S‑apꞌekam Kih o wepogidas g Jiosh kihdag. K g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag am t‑chehgidch mo pi koi ab hu kuhpiꞌoks g Jiosh kihdag am t‑wehhejed mo eda wabsh kia an kuhpi hegai kih.  
HEB09:9	This is an illustration for us in the present, showing us that the gifts and sacrifices that are offered can't make the worshiper's conscience clear.  	K d wabsh chehgida mo g haꞌichu doakam ab iagchulid Jiosh wui. Pi at woho am wo i ha apꞌech Jiosh tahgio. K heg hekaj am wabsh kia e kudut heg hekaj pi ap e‑chuꞌijig.  
HEB09:10	They're just religious regulations—about food and drink, and various ceremonies involving washing—which were put in place until the time of God's new way of relating to him. 	Ihda heki hu chehanig o wa am ha chehgidch mat haschu wo koꞌad ch has masma wo i e apꞌechudad e lihmhunch am Jiosh wehhejed am hugkam mat hekid g Jiosh am wo i wechijid wehs haꞌichu am t‑wehhejed. 
HEB09:11	Christ has come as a high priest of all the good experiences we now have. He went into the greater, more complete tabernacle that wasn't made by human hands—not part of this created world.  	Tsh wa id am woho hab e juh g Christ k d si uhgchu pahl am dahm hegai s‑kehg haꞌichu mash g Jiosh hab kaij matsh hab wo t‑juni. Hegai apchuda mo am eda chikpan g Christ o baꞌich i geꞌej ch baꞌich i s‑apꞌe mo hegai geꞌe cheopi mani am heki hu ahg. Pi at g oꞌodham am nahto. K pi d ihda jewed dahm haꞌichu.  
HEB09:12	He didn't enter through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood. He entered once, for all time, into the Most Holy Place, setting us free forever. 	Hemho at am i wah g Christ heg eda apchuda s‑ap nahtok g t‑doꞌibiadag. Hegam mo d jewed dahm papal o wabsh g haꞌichu doakam ha‑ehꞌed am iagchulid. T wabshaba g Jiosh alidag g hejel e‑ehꞌedkaj ab t‑behi g pi ha huhugedam doakag.  
HEB09:13	For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a cow sprinkled on those who are ritually unclean make the body ceremonially clean,  	Neh, mash wa g ha‑ehꞌed g siswat ch totolo ab e sihbanid ch g matai ab amjed g wisilo mehidag ab e nehnichud ha dahm g hemajkam mat wo ha chehgi mat wo i ha kegch g Jiosh heg amjed matp hems pi ap am hu hab junihim g e‑himdag chehanig.  
HEB09:14	how much more does the blood of Christ—who offered himself in his sinless life to God through the eternal Spirit—clean your consciences from your past sinful lives so you can serve the living God? 	Pegih, t baꞌich i geꞌe haꞌichu hab t‑juni g Christ mat am i e dagito Jiosh wui k am t‑wehhejed e muhkid. Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag o wa ab mahkch g gewkdag mat hab juh. K d hekia s‑apꞌekam iagchulida. Heki achd hu t‑kudut heg hekaj pi ap t‑chuꞌijig. T wabshaba g Christ am iagchul g e‑ehꞌed Jiosh wui mat am wo i t‑apꞌech. Kuch am hahawa g Jiosh wehhejed chikpan. 
HEB09:15	This is why he is the mediator of a new agreed relationship. Since a death has occurred to set them free from the sins committed under the first agreed relationship, now those who are called can receive the promise of an eternal inheritance.  	Bash kaij g Jiosh matsh ab wo t‑mah g pi ha huhugedam doakag k ab wo i t‑wahpki e‑kihdag ed. T g alidaj am i apꞌech ihda wechij haꞌichu ahgaj t‑wehhejed ahchim mo g Jiosh ab t‑waid. Muhkigaj at am i t‑wuwhas matt pi wo ai g t‑namkidadag heg hekaj pi ap t‑chuꞌijig ab wecho hegai heki hu apchuda. 
HEB09:16	For a will to be implemented, the person who made it must be dead.  	Neh, mat hema wo muh k am wo dagito g e‑ahga mat hedai wo i ui g haꞌichu enigaj. T hemho wa am wo e wohokamch mat muh ihda oꞌodham. Kut am hahawa hab wo e juh g ahgaj.  
HEB09:17	A will is only valid when there's been a death—and is never applied while the person who made it is still alive.  	Pi at hab wo shaꞌi e juh g ahgaj mat wo kia doakad. T hekid wo i muh, t hab haha wo e juh.  
HEB09:18	That's why the first agreement was established with blood. 	Chum hems hegai heki hu apchuda am ha shahgid g Jiosh ch hemajkam at i e apꞌech g ehꞌedkaj.  
HEB09:19	After Moses had given all the commandments of the law to everyone, he took the blood of calves and goats, and together with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, sprinkled the book itself and all the people.  	Mosesbad atsh wehpeg am wehs ha ahgi g chehanig mo has i masma an oꞌohanas k am hahawa wasib g wisilo ch siswat ha‑ehꞌed k g shuhdagi am i wehnad k id oꞌos heg ab oꞌohana mo an hab chuꞌig g chehanig ch ab ha dahm g hemajkam. Batsh juh ihda am wa has mahs shaꞌikaj mo hab e aꞌaga ‘hyssop’ ch kahwal wopo mo i wegiumdas.  
HEB09:20	He said to them, “This is the blood of the agreed relationship that God has told you he wants with you.”  	Kush wa hab kaij g Mosesbad: 
HEB09:23	So if the copies of what is in heaven needed to be cleansed in this way, the things in heaven needed cleansing by better sacrifices. 	Neh, bo masma i e kegchud idam mo am wabsh oidch hab chuꞌig hegai mash am Jiosh kihdag ed. T wabshaba g dahm kahchim apchuda hemho wa baꞌich i s‑apꞌekam iagchulidakaj wo i e kegch. 
HEB09:24	For Christ hasn't entered a Most Holy Place constructed by human beings that is only a pattern of the original. He has entered heaven itself, and now appears on our behalf, speaking for us in God's presence.  	Hegai Si Hekia S‑apꞌekam Kih ash am oidch hab junis g Jiosh kihdag. Tsh g Jiosh alidag pi am wabsh i wah heg eda k wabshaba am i wah Jiosh kihdag ed k idani am t‑wehhejed neok am tahgio g Jiosh. 
HEB09:25	This was not to repeatedly offer himself, like a high priest has to enter the Most Holy Place year after year, offering blood that is not his own.  	Uhgchu t‑pahlig ahchim Tutuligo o wabsh g haꞌichu doakam t‑mumꞌajid ch ab Jiosh wui iagchulid. Tsh wabshaba g Jiosh alidag baꞌich i s‑ap iagchulida hab juh nat pi hejel e muhkid am t‑wehhejed. 
HEB09:26	Otherwise Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. No: just this one time at the end of the present age he came to remove sin by sacrificing himself.  	Tsh wabshaba g Jiosh alidag wabsh hemho hab juh k pi muꞌikko e muhkid am t‑wehhejed. Neh, k hab masma tasho mat s‑ap nahto g e‑chikpan mat gam hu hab i juh g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig. Kush hemu hahawa e aihim mat g jewed wo huhug. 
HEB09:27	Just as human beings die only once, and then are judged,  	Am o apchudas mat hemho wa wo muh g oꞌodham hemho k heg i dahm ab wo ai g geꞌe lodaita tash.  
HEB09:28	so too for Christ—having been sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people, he will come again, not to deal with sin, but to save those who wait for him. 	Bat wa masma g Christ hab waꞌap hemho am i e dagito t‑wehhejed k gam hu hab i juh g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig. T id pi am hahawa ep d wo chikpanajk. Tsh wabshaba ia ep wo i e maskogi mat wo t‑doꞌibia ahchim mach ab si hiwig ch ab nenida mat ab ep wo jiwia. 
HEB10:1	The law is just a shadow of the good that was to come, and not the actual reality. So it can never through the repeated sacrifices offered year after year make right those who come to worship God.  	Ab ash wa t‑chehani g Jiosh matt ab wui wo ha iagchulidad g haꞌichu doakam wehs aꞌahid ab. Id atki pi gam hu hab wo i juh g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig k wabshaba wabsh s‑kohmagim t‑chehgidch mat has masma g Jiosh gam hu hab haha wo i juh.  
HEB10:2	Otherwise wouldn't the sacrifices have stopped being offered? If the worshipers had been made clean once and for all, they wouldn't have had guilty consciences any longer.  	Pi at ep wo t‑kudutad g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig matp gam hu s‑ap hab wo i e juh heg hekaj iagchulida. Kutt heki hu waꞌi haꞌasa hab wo juh.  
HEB10:3	But in fact those sacrifices remind people of sins year after year,  	Ihda t‑iagchulida o am wabsh i t‑chechegitolid g t‑chuꞌijig wehs ahid ab.  
HEB10:4	because it's impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to remove sins. 	Pi at hekid wo shaꞌi e nako g totolo ch siswat ha‑ehꞌed mas gam hu hab wo i juh g t‑chuꞌijig.  
HEB10:5-6	That's why when Christ  came into the world he said, “You didn't want sacrifices or offerings, but you did prepare a body for me.  Burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin gave you no pleasure.  	Sh heg hekaj ab wui hab kaij g Jiosh g alidaj am wo jiwiak jewed dahm: 
HEB10:11	Every priest officiates in the services day after day, again and again offering the same sacrifices that can never remove sins.  	Wehs tashkaj o am hab wua g e‑chikpan g t‑papalig ch muꞌikko hab wua g iagchulida. T wabshaba ihda iagchulida pi hekid gam hu hab wo i juh g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig.  
HEB10:12	But this Priest, after he had offered for sins a single sacrifice that lasts forever, sat down at God's right hand.  	Jiosh alidag at hi hemako iagchulida hab juh mat gam hu hab wo i juh. K id chum hekid s‑kehgaj heg wehhejed. T g Jiosh ab hahawa si has elid k an e wehm dahshch e‑kownal daikud ed.  
HEB10:13	Now he waits until all his enemies are conquered, becoming like a footstool for him.  	K idani ab dak ch ab wo ai mat g Jiosh wo ha gewitojel hegam mo ab wui gegok.  
HEB10:14	For by a single sacrifice he has set right forever those who are being made holy.  	Pegih, t hemho am e iagchul t‑wehhejed k hekaj i ha apꞌech iaꞌi amjed wehs hegam mat gam hu oa g pi apꞌekam ha‑ihbdag ed. 
HEB10:15	As the Holy Spirit also tells us, for having said,  	Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag o am hab waꞌap wohokamchud ihda hab masma: 
HEB10:19	Now we have the confidence, brothers and sisters, to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus.  	Ab ach hahawa si apꞌedag matt ab wo i miabi g Jiosh nat pi muh g Jesus am t‑wehhejed. Id o heg wa wepo mach apꞌedag matt am wo i wahp heg eda Si Hekia S‑apꞌekam Kih.  
HEB10:20	Through his life and death,  he opened up a brand-new, living way through the veil to God.  	E at muhkid g Christ am t‑wehhejed k hab masma ab i kuhpiꞌo ihda wechij himdag am t‑wehhejed  
HEB10:21	Since we have such a great priest placed in charge over the house of God,  	no pi s‑wohom d si uhgchu t‑pahlig ahchim Jiosh hemajkamga.  
HEB10:22	let us come close to God with sincere minds, totally trusting in him. Our minds have been sprinkled to purify them from our evil way of thinking, and our bodies have been washed clean by pure water.  	Hekai ach hu t‑kudut g pi ap t‑chuꞌijigkaj. T wabshaba ab i t‑kegchud k gam hu hab i juh g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig. Kuch heg hekai ab si hiwig ch d hekiakam ch ab wo i miabi g Jiosh.  
HEB10:23	So let us hold onto the hope we're telling others about, never hesitating, for God who promised is trustworthy.  	Jiosh at woho ab wo t‑juni mash has i kaij. Kutt heg hekaj si s‑wihnam wo t‑uꞌukch heg ab.  
HEB10:24	Let's think about how we can motivate one another to love and to do what is good.  	Ab att hig aꞌai wo si pihk t‑elidad ch ab aꞌai wo i t‑wehmtad matt am wo chehgidad mach ab ha tatchua g hemajkam ch am wo i ha wehmajk.  
HEB10:25	We should not give up meeting together, as some have done. In fact we should be encouraging one another, especially as you see the End approaching. 	Haꞌi at haꞌasa ha wehm e nam g e‑wehm wohochuddam. Kumt wabshaba ahpim pi hab wo chum e juh k ab wo si aꞌai i e gewkemhunad. E o aihim mat ep wo jiwia g t‑kownalig Jesus. Kutt hekaj wahm baꞌich ab wo i t‑gewkemhunad. 
HEB10:26	For if we deliberately go on sinning after we've understood the truth, there's no longer any sacrifice for sins.  	Pi at gam hu hab wo shaꞌi e juh g chuꞌijigaj hegai mat am hab wo kia junihid g pi apꞌekam ha chum s‑mahchch g wohokam. Pi o am hu hahawa haꞌichug mas haschu am wo e iagchul heg wehhejed.  
HEB10:27	All that's left is fear, expecting the impending judgment and the terrible fire that destroys those who are hostile to God.  	Jiosh atsh wo ha lodait k gam hu wo ha shul s‑koꞌok ha‑namkidadag ed. K id hab masma mo g pi ha huhugedam mei. Heg o am waꞌi wiꞌis mat wo chum si s‑ehbidad matsh has wo ha juh. 
HEB10:28	Someone who rejects the law of Moses is put to death without mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses.  	Mosesbad atki an oꞌohana Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana ed matsh gohk o waik wo wohokamch g chuꞌijigaj hegai mat gam hu wo s‑ohhod g Jiosh chehanig. Kutsh wo e muhkid.  
HEB10:29	How much worse do you think someone will deserve their punishment if they have trampled underfoot the Son of God, if they have disregarded the blood that sealed the agreement and makes us holy, treating it as ordinary and trivial, and have abused the Spirit of grace?  	Kumt baꞌich i s‑koꞌok namkidadag ab wo bei mamtp pi ab hu wo haꞌichuch g Jiosh alidag. Heg at iawua g e‑ehꞌed k e muhkid mat gam hu hab wo i chum juh g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig.

HEB10:30	We know God, and he said, “I will make sure that justice is done; I will give people what they deserve.” He also said, “The Lord will judge his people.”  	nash pi hab kaij g Jiosh: 
HEB10:32	Just remember the past when, after you understood the truth, you experienced a great deal of suffering.  	Am g wo s‑chegito mo wa has chuꞌig haꞌichu am em‑wehhejed. Muꞌi haꞌichu amt nako amjed mamt ab s‑mai g wohokam k eda pi shaꞌi e gehgch heg hekaj.

HEB11:4	By trusting him Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain, and as a result God identified him as someone who lived right. God showed this by accepting his offering. Even though Abel has been dead for a long time, he still speaks to us through what he did.  	Hema ash wa hab chehgig Abel ch ash ab s‑wohochud g Jiosh ch hekaj ab s‑wohog elid k ab wui iagchul g haꞌichu doakam e‑muꞌa. Tsh wabshaba g wehngajbad Cain pi hab masma hab e juh.

HEB11:5	By trusting God Enoch was taken to heaven so he didn't experience death. He couldn't be found on earth because God took him to heaven. Before this happened he was known as someone God was pleased with. 	Hema ash wa hab chehgig Enoc ch ash ab s‑wohochud g Jiosh. Sh g Jiosh s‑hohhoꞌid ch gam hu i bei mash wabsh kia doa. Kutsh pi hedai edagi.  
HEB11:6	You can't expect God to be pleased with you if you don't trust him! Anyone who comes to God must believe that God exists, and that he rewards those who are searching for him. 	Hegam at wo waꞌi s‑ha hohhoꞌidad g Jiosh mat hedai ab wo s‑wohochudad. Hegai mat ab wo i miabi g Jiosh at hemho wa wo s‑wohoch mo an hema d Jiosh ch am i e tashogid ha wui hegam mo ab s‑mahchimk. 
HEB11:7	Noah trusted God, and was warned by him about things that had never happened before. Because Noah paid serious attention to what God said, he constructed an ark to save his family. By trusting God, Noah showed that the world was wrong, and received the reward of being set right by God. 	Noahbad atsh ab i s‑wohoch g Jiosh k ab si has elid.

HEB11:8	Through trusting God Abraham obeyed when God called him to go to the land God was going to give him. He left, not knowing where he was going.

HEB11:10	For Abraham was looking forward to a city built on foundations that last, with God as its builder and maker. 	Abrahambad ash ab wui e gewkad hegai kihhim mo d Jiosh nahtoi ch pi hekid wo i gei. 
HEB11:11	By her trust in God even Sarah herself was given the ability to conceive a child though she was too old, because she trusted God who had made the promise.  	Abrahambad ch Sarabad ash wa ab s‑wohochud g Jiosh mash wa hab ha ahgid matsh wo hema mahsid g ali matsh eda heki hu kekelit. Sh g Sarabad pi ha mamdat.  
HEB11:12	That is why the descendants of Abraham, (who was as good as dead!), became as numerous as the stars of heaven, as countless as the sand of the sea-shore.

HEB11:13	They all died still trusting in God. Though they didn't receive the things God promised, they were still looking for them as it were from a distance and welcomed them, acknowledging that on this earth they were foreigners, people just passing through. 	Wehsijj idam mach am ha chehcheg at koꞌo k huhug koi wehs uꞌuk hegai mash haschu g Jiosh ab ha makiog.

HEB11:16	But they're looking for a better country instead, a heavenly country. That is why God isn't disappointed with them, and is happy to be called their God, for he has built a city for them.

HEB11:17	Abraham trusted God when he was tested and offered Isaac to God. Abraham, who had accepted God's promises, was still ready to offer to God his only son, 	Abrahambad alidag ash hab chehgig Isaac.

HEB11:19	Abraham had thought it through and decided that God could bring Isaac back to life from the dead. In a sense that's what did happen—Abraham received Isaac back from the dead.

HEB11:23	Trusting in God, Moses' parents hid him for three months after he was born. They recognized he was a special child. They weren't afraid to go against what the king had commanded.

HEB11:26	He counted the rejection he experienced from following Christ to be of far greater value than the wealth of Egypt—because he was focused on the reward to come.

HEB11:37	Some were stoned, cut in pieces, tempted, killed by the sword. Some dressed in sheepskins and goatskins: destitute, oppressed, and mistreated.

HEB11:40	God has given us something even better, so that they can't be complete without us. 	Jiosh at hab masma apꞌech mat ab t‑wehm wo bei g baꞌich i s‑kehg apꞌedag. 
HEB12:1	For that reason, since we are surrounded by such a great crowd of people who gave evidence of their trust in God, let's get rid of everything that holds us back, the seductive sins that trip us up, and let's keep on running the race placed before us.  	Neh, idam muꞌi hemajkam at e nako no pi ab s‑wohochud g Jiosh. K id am t‑chehgidch matt ahchim hab waꞌap masma wo t‑nako. Muꞌi o haꞌichu ged hu wabsh i chum t‑wulshshap.

Kutt ahchim hab wa masma am s‑gewkam wo i t‑nako t‑wohochudadag ed.  
HEB12:2	We should keep on looking to Jesus, the one who begins and completes our trust in God. Because of the joy ahead of him Jesus endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and sat down at the right hand of God's throne.  	Pegih, tt hig am wo i t‑gewpkai Jesus wui.

HEB12:4	Your resistance so far hasn't cost you blood as you fight against sin.  	Koi amt haꞌichu shaꞌi nako ab wui gegokch g pi apꞌekam.  
HEB12:5-6	Have you forgotten God's appeal to you when he reasons with you as his children? He says, “My child, don't treat the Lord's discipline lightly, and don't give up when he corrects you either.  The Lord disciplines everyone he loves, and he punishes everyone he welcomes as his child.”  	Pi g am wo pi chegito mo ab si i em‑gewkemhun g Jiosh ch hab masma ab em‑wehm neok mam d aꞌaligaj mash wa hab kaij:

HEB12:9	For if we respected our earthly fathers who disciplined us, shouldn't we even more be subject to the discipline of our spiritual Father which leads to life?  	Neh, em‑jehj atp hems ab s‑gewkam haꞌichu em‑shohbi. Kum ab si has ha elid. Pegih, baꞌich o i matt ab wo i t‑dagito t‑ohg Jiosh wui k ab wo bei g pi ha huhugedam doakag.  
HEB12:10	They disciplined us for a short while as they thought appropriate, but God does so for our benefit in order that we can share his holy character.

HEB12:11	When it happens, all discipline seems painful and not something to be happy about. But later on it produces peace in those who have been trained in this way so that they do what is right. 	Pi o ta hohhoꞌidama mo hekid i s‑gewkam t‑shohbid g Jiosh. Ch wabshaba heg amjed bebhe g si s‑apꞌekam doakag ch hahawa si s‑ap t‑tahtk.

JAS01:3-4	because you know that endurance comes from dealing with challenges to your trust in God.  Let your endurance become as strong as possible, so that you will be completely mature, without any shortcomings. 	Id o aꞌappem g em-wohochudadag ch wo i gewkai. Kumt hab s-ap wo nahtoisk ch s-ap wo nakogad g e-shoꞌigdag. 
JAS01:5	If any of you need wisdom, ask God, who gives generously to everyone without holding back.  	Haꞌijj amtp hems haꞌichu pi amichud. Kuni am em-ahgid mamt ab wo tai g Jiosh g amichudadag. T ab wo i em-mah. Jiosh o si s-baꞌama ab ha mamka g hemajkam mo haschu i tatchua ch pi ha kehꞌid.  
JAS01:6	But when you ask, remember to trust in God—don't have any doubts. Someone who doubts is like the crashing waves of the sea, tossed about and driven by the wind.  	Mt wabshaba hemho wa wo s-wohochudad mat hab wo em-juni g Jiosh mam haschu ab i tahni. Hegam mo pi wohochud at wabsh haꞌichukaj wo e kudu hab sha masma mat g shuhdagi g hewelkaj wo e kudut k an aꞌai has wo e wuad.

JAS01:8	their minds think every which way, and they're unstable in whatever they do. 	no pi pi am hu shelinim wawani g ha-wohochudadag.

Jiosh o am wehs t-wepo t-haꞌichuchud. S-kakais at haꞌas s-hohtam gam hu hab wo i e juh mat g shoꞌigkam.  
JAS01:11	For the sun rises along with the blistering wind and scorches the grass. The flowers fall and their beauty is marred. Everything the rich achieve will fade in just the same way. 	T g si s-has haꞌichu hab ha-juni wo huhug hab sha masma mat g haꞌichu wuhshanig wo huhug mat hekid wo gaksh g jewed am s-toni k ed. 
JAS01:12	Happy is anyone who patiently endures temptation, for when they've proved that they are trustworthy, they will receive the crown of life which God promises to those who love him.

JAS01:13	Nobody should say when they're tempted, “I'm being tempted by God.” For God is not tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone.  	Pi g hab wo shaꞌi chehꞌi mas g Jiosh hab chum em-wua mamtp wo sha pi ap nako g e-aꞌappemadag k hab wo juh g pi apꞌekam. Jiosh o pi hekid hab wua g pi apꞌekam ch pi hedai hab chum ha wua mas hab wo juh g pi apꞌekam.  
JAS01:14-15	Temptations come from our own evil desires that lead us astray and entrap us.  Such desires lead to sin, and sin, when it's fully developed, causes death. 	Oꞌodham o wabsh hejel e-tatchuikaj hab wua g pi apꞌekam. T g Jiosh ab wo i ha mah g s-koꞌok namkidadag heg wehhejed.

JAS01:17	All that's good, every perfect gift, is from above, and comes down from the Father who made heaven's lights. Unlike them he doesn't change—he doesn't vary or cause shadows.  	Jiosh at s-kehg nahto wehs haꞌichu. K wehs s-kehgaj hegai mo ab t-mahkch. Tash ch mashad ch huhuꞌu hebaichuj pi ab hu t-mahkch g tonlig no pi g jewed e nodgid.

JAS01:19	Remember this, my dear friends: everyone should be quick to listen but slow to speak, and slow to get angry,  	Pi g wo s-e hohtkid mamt haꞌichu hab wo chei. Baꞌich o i s-apꞌe mamt wo haꞌichu kaihamad. 
JAS01:20	because human anger doesn't reflect the good character of God. 	Pi at hab masma wo i e apꞌech g pi em-apꞌedag. Jiosh at am wo waꞌi apꞌech g pi t-apꞌedag. 
JAS01:21	So get rid of all that's filthy and evil. Humbly accept the word that's been implanted within you—for this is what can save you.  	Gam g hu hab wo i juhni wehs haꞌichu mo s-bihtagi am em-chegitoi ed ch am em-doakag ed. Ab g wabsh wo i e shoꞌigchud Jiosh wui k ab wo i s-wohoch g haꞌichu ahgaj. Kut heg hekaj wo em-doꞌibia.

JAS01:23	If you just listen to the word, and don't act on it, it's like staring at your own face in a mirror.  	Jiosh oꞌohana o hab sha masma mo g neidakud matt heg eda ab wo i t-neid k wo cheh mo haschu pi kehg hab mahs am t-doakag ed.

JAS01:25	But if you look to the perfect law of freedom and follow it, not as someone who just listens and then forgets, but as someone who acts on it—then you will be blessed in what you do.  	k wabshaba am wo si oidahid g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch am hab wo junihid.

JAS01:27	In the eyes of our God and Father, religion that's pure and genuine is to visit orphans and widows in their suffering, and to keep yourself from being contaminated by the world.

JAS02:2-3	Imagine that a man comes into your synagogue wearing gold rings and fine clothes, and then a poor man comes in dressed in rags.  If you pay special attention to the well-dressed man, and say, “Please sit here in a seat of honor,” while you say to the poor man, “Stand over there, or sit on the floor by my feet,”  	Pi o apꞌe mamtp hema wo si s-ap dai g s-kais oꞌodham k eda hab wo ah g shoꞌigkam mat gam hu wabsh wo kehkkad o wo dahiwua jewedo.

JAS02:5	Listen, my dear friends: Didn't God choose those who the world considers poor to be rich in their trust in him, and to inherit the kingdom he promised to those who love him?  	Jiosh ash ab ha makiog g shoꞌig hemajkam g geꞌe wohochudadag mat am wo apꞌedagk kihdaj ed. Kutsh wehsijj ab wo i ha wahpki hegam mo ab tatchua.

JAS02:12-13	You should speak and act as people who will be judged by the law of freedom.  Anyone who doesn't show mercy will be judged without mercy. Yet mercy wins out over judgment!

JAS02:14	My friends, what's the good of someone saying they trust in God when they don't do what's right? Can such “trust” save them?  	Pi o woho d Jiosh wohochuddam hegam mat pi hab wo junihid g tatchuij. Kut pi wo ha doꞌibia. Haꞌichu hab t‑juni at wo t‑wohokamch machs d wohochuddam.

JAS02:17	By itself even your trust-based faith in God is dead and worthless if you don't actually do what's right. 	Pi ach woho wohochud g Jiosh mattp pi am hu hab wo junihid g tatchuij. 
JAS02:18	Someone may argue, “You have your trust in God; I have my good deeds.” Well, show me your trust in God without good deeds, and I will show you my trust in God by my good deeds!  	Haꞌijj amki hab e elid mamt ab wabsh wo s‑wohochudad g Jiosh ch eda pi am hu hab wo junihid g tatchuij. K eda hab chuꞌig mat g haꞌichu hab t‑juni wo tashogi g t‑wohochudadag.

JAS02:23	In this way scripture was fulfilled: “Abraham trusted God, and this was considered as him doing right, and he was called the friend of God.” 	T hekaj am e wohokamch hegai mo an oꞌohanas:

Pilin o d al chum haꞌichu. Kutt eda wo pilindad g kawyu k hekaj wo t‑nako matt wo i nodagi mattp hebai wo i s‑nodgidam.

JAS03:6	And the tongue is a fire! The tongue is a world of evil among the parts of the body. It disgraces all you are as a person, and can burn down the whole of your life, since it is set on fire by Gehenna. 	Pi kehg neꞌoki o ab d Jiawul amjedkam.

JAS03:12	My friends, a fig tree can't produce olives, and a vine can't produce figs, any more than a salt water spring can produce fresh water! 	No ab i wushke g suhna uhdwis waꞌug ab?

It is genuine and not hypocritical.

JHN01:14-16	The Word became human and lived among us, and we saw his glory, the glory of the Father's one and only Son, full of grace and truth. John gave his testimony about him, shouting out to the people, “This is the one I was telling you about when I said, ‘The one who is coming after me is more important than me, for before I ever existed he already was.’ ”  We have all been recipients of his generous nature, one gracious gift after another.

JHN02:9	The master of ceremonies didn't know where it had come from, only the servants knew. But when he tasted the water that had been turned to wine, he called the bridegroom over. 	D ab jeh mo d si s-kehg nawait k eda pi mahch mas hebai waꞌi. Hegam o hi wa s-mahch pion mat hebai waꞌi.  
JHN02:10	“Everyone serves out the best wine first,” he told him, “and once people have had plenty to drink, then they put out the cheaper wine. But you have kept the best wine till last!”  	D am i cheh g ha-hohntam am i jehk g nawait k hab kaij ab wui, “Shaꞌi s-ap ab kahk ihda nawait.

JHN02:11	This was the very first of Jesus' miraculous signs, and was performed in Cana of Galilee. Here he revealed his glory, and his disciples put their trust in him. 	Neh, k id d si wehpeg s-hasig haꞌichu hab junij g Jesus. D am mahsko wua g e-gewkdag. Kuchd ab si s-wohochud mo woho d Jiosh si Kehsha. 
JHN02:12	After this Jesus left for Capernaum with his mother, brothers, and disciples where they stayed for a few days.  	D am hahawa hab i e ah g Jesus matt am wo hihi Capernaum kihhim wui. D g jeꞌej ch wepngaj ep t-oi. Ch am haꞌichugkahim heꞌekia tash. 
JHN02:13	Since it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went on to Jerusalem.  	Wehs ahid ab o am e wushshad Jerusalem t am matsh wa g Jiosh ha doꞌibia g t‑shohshon. Kud am i e ai. Kuchd gam hu hihim

JHN02:15	He made a whip out of cords and drove everyone out of the Temple, along with the sheep and cattle, scattering coins of the money-changers and turning over their tables.

JHN02:17	His disciples remembered the Scripture that says, “My devotion for your house is like a fire burning inside me!” 	Kuchd am hahawa i chegito mo g Jiosh heki oꞌohana hab chuꞌig: 
JHN02:18	The Jewish leaders reacted, asking him, “What right do you have to do this? Show us some miraculous sign to prove it!” 	D ab si chehmo g hahaꞌichu k hab ahg, “Shahchu ap ahgch hab wua ihda? Am g hig t‑chehgid g s‑hasig haꞌichu. Kutt hab wo s‑mahchk map uꞌukch g e‑gewkdag ab amjed g Jiosh.” 
JHN02:19	Jesus replied, “Destroy this Temple, and in three days I'll raise it up!” 	D hab kaij g Jesus, “Pegih oig, m ant wo wa em‑chehgi g s‑hasig haꞌichu. Mt wo padch ihda mo g Jiosh am eda kih. Kunt ahni ep wo i kegch mat d wo i waik tashk.” 
JHN02:20	“It took forty-six years to build this Temple, and you're going to raise it up in three days?” the Jewish leaders replied.  	D idam si e shoꞌoshodkad k hab kaij, “Giꞌikko gamai chuhdp (46) aꞌahid ab at hahawa i e nahto ihda geꞌe cheopi. Kuptp eda ahpi waik tash ab ia wo i kei.” 
JHN02:21	But the Temple Jesus was speaking of was his body.  	K eda g Jesus hejel hab e ahg mat wo e muhkid k uhpam ep wo e chegito.  
JHN02:22	After he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered what he said, and so they believed in Scripture and Jesus' own words. 	Kutt s‑chegito g neꞌokij mat hekid uhpam e chegito am e muhkidk. Neh, bo chuꞌig g Jiosh oꞌohana mat uhpam wo e chegito g Jiosh si Kehsha. Kutt hahawa s‑amichud k ab s‑wohoch. 
JHN02:23-24	As a result of the miracles Jesus did while he was in Jerusalem during the Passover, many believed in him.  But Jesus did not trust himself to them, because he knew all about people.  	Am achd haꞌichugkahim Jerusalem t am wehs oidam g t‑shohshon ha‑doꞌibiadag wuhshda. Kud muꞌijj ab i s‑wohoch g Jesus. D wabshaba pi am hu i e tashogi ha wui mas hedai wud no pi s‑mahch mo heg wabsh hekaj ab s‑wohochud mo am neid mo hab juni him g s‑hasig haꞌichu.  
JHN02:25	He didn't need anyone to tell him about human nature for he knew the way people think. 	Pi o hedai ab hu hiwig g Jesus mas am wo ahgi g hemajkam ha‑chegitoi no pi heki hu s‑mahch. 
JHN03:1	There was a man named Nicodemus, a Pharisee and a member of the Jewish ruling council.  	Am ad hema d si s‑has haꞌichu am t‑himdag ed ch d ge Palasi ch hab chehgig Nicodemas.  
JHN03:2	He came at night to where Jesus was and said, “Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God, for nobody could do the miraculous signs you're doing unless God was with him.” 	Kuchd am hu hebai dadha chuhug ch ed. D id am i chehgim g Jesus k hab kaij ab wui, “S‑mahch ach mat am i m‑kei g Jiosh mapt wo t‑mashcha. Pi at hedai wo e nako mas hejel hab wo juh hegai s‑hasig haꞌichu map hab junihim. Jiosh oki ab m‑mahkch g gewkdag.” 
JHN03:3	“I tell you the truth,” Jesus replied, “Unless you are reborn, you can't experience God's kingdom.” 	D hab kaij g Jesus, “Nt wo si shel m‑ahgi mat hegam d wo waꞌi Jiosh hemajkamgak mat hedai gokko wo mamsi. Bo wa chuꞌig g Jiosh kownaltalig.” 
JHN03:4	“How can you be reborn when you're old?” Nicodemus asked. “You can't go back into your mother's womb and be born a second time!” 	D hab kaij g Nicodemas, “Tt has hig masma ep wo mahsi heki hu kelitk. Aha natt am ep wo i wah t‑jeꞌe ed k ep wo mahsi?” 
JHN03:5-6	“I tell you the truth, you can't enter God's kingdom unless you are born of water and the Spirit,” Jesus told him.  “What's born of the flesh is flesh, and what's born of the Spirit is Spirit.  	D g Jesus hab kaij, “Piaꞌa. Dam wabsh ha‑aꞌaliga ab ha ab mamsik. Bani m‑ahgid ab amjed g wechij doakag.

JHN03:7	Don't be surprised at my telling you, ‘You must be reborn.’ 	Pi g am e todsid mani hab kaij mamt hemho wa ep wo mamsi.  
JHN03:8	The wind blows wherever it wants, and just as you hear the sound it makes, but don't know where it's coming from or where it's going, that's how it is for everyone who is born of the spirit.” 	Neh, kah ap g hewel m an hewelhog.

JHN03:9	“How is this possible?” Nicodemus asked. 	D g Nicodemas hab kaij, “A, kus has masma hab chuꞌig?” 
JHN03:10	“You're a famous teacher in Israel,  and yet you don't understand such things?” Jesus replied.  	D hab kaij g Jesus, “Aha, nap pi amichud ch eda d wa chum ge uhgk ha mashchamdam g Tutuligo?  
JHN03:11	“I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know and give evidence regarding what we have seen, but you refuse to accept our testimony.  	Do si wohokam ihda mani m‑ahgid. M ach ahgachug mach haschu s‑ap s‑mahch ch am em‑ahgid mach haschu neid. M eda pi wohochud g haꞌichu t‑ahga.

JHN03:14	Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so the Son of man must be lifted up,  	D hab ep kaij g Jesus, “An o hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed matsh wa g t‑shohshonbad muꞌi e keꞌij g kohkꞌoikaj mash eda am oiopo tohono jewed ch ed.

JHN03:15	that everyone who trusts in him will have eternal life. 	Kutp hedai ab wo ni‑hiwig k wo e doꞌibia ab amjed g pi ap e‑chuꞌijig.” Neh, bad kaij g Jesus. 
JHN03:16	For God loved the world, and this is how:  he gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who trusts in him shouldn't die, but have eternal life.  	Pegih neh, ab o si t‑tatchua g Jiosh ch hiwigi g e‑alidag mat am i e dagito k e muhkid am t‑wehhejed mach d pi ap chuꞌijkam. Kut pi wo bei g s‑koꞌok e‑namkidadag matp hedai ab wo hiwig k wabshaba g pi ha huhugedam doakag wo bei.  
JHN03:17	God didn't send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him.  	Jiosh at am cheha g e‑alidag mat in wo i wuhsh jewed dahm k wo ha doꞌibia g hemajkam. Kut pi heg hekaj in i wuhsh mas ab wo haꞌichu t‑mohtoꞌi.  
JHN03:18	Those who trust in him are not condemned, while those who don't trust in him are condemned  already because they didn't trust in the one and only Son of God.  	Pi o ab hu haꞌichu mohtoꞌis hegam mo ab hiwig g Jiosh alidag. Hegam o ab heki hu haꞌichu mohtoꞌis mo pi ab hu hiwig.  
JHN03:19-20	This is how the decision  is made: the light came to the world, but people loved the darkness rather than the light, for their actions were evil.  All those who do evil hate the light and don't come into the light, because they don't want their actions to be exposed.  	Ia at jiwia jewed dahm hegai mo woho tonlidch g t‑chegitoidag.

JHN03:22	After this Jesus and his disciples went into Judea and spent some time with the people, baptizing them.  	Am i dahm, kuchd am i wuwha Jerusalem kihhim t amjed k am oiopohim Judea chekshani ch ed ch ha pahl wapkon g hemajkam. 
JHN03:23-24	John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water there and people kept coming to be baptized.  (This was before John was imprisoned).  	Md eda wenog koi kuh hegai John mad ha pahl wapkon. Sh am oimmed ch ha pahl wapkon Aenon t am miabidch g Salim kihhim no pi am ge shohshon ch s‑shuhdagig.  
JHN03:25	An argument developed between John's disciples and a Jew over ceremonial purification.  	Sh am haꞌichug hegam mash ab si wecho e mashcham. Kutsh am hema jiwia g t‑wehm oꞌodham k ha wehm neꞌowi ab amjed g pahl wakona.  
JHN03:26	They went to John and told him, “Rabbi, the man you were with on the other side of the Jordan River, the one you testified in support of—see, now he's baptizing, and everyone is going to him!” 	Tsh idam am hahawa hihi John wui k hab kaij, “T‑mashchamdam, hema at wa am m‑wui jiwia map wa am ha pahl wapkon gam hu aigojed g Jordan akimel. Kup wa am si s‑mahch ch ahg mo hig woho d si s‑has haꞌichu. Pegih, heg ash hab waꞌap ha pahl wapkon. Kush wehsijj gam hu haꞌab him wui.” 
JHN03:27	“No one receives anything unless they're given it from heaven,” John replied.  	Sh hab kaij g John, “Heg ach ab waꞌi bekch mo haschu g Jiosh ab t‑mahkch.  
JHN03:28	“You yourselves can testify that I declared, ‘I'm not the Messiah. I've been sent to prepare his way.’  	Bani wa kaij mani pi d Jiosh si Kehsha ch wabsh am haꞌichu i apꞌechud g ia jiwhiadaj wehhejed. Am am wa kah mani wa hab kaij.  
JHN03:29	The bridegroom is the one who has the bride! The best man waits, listening for the bridegroom, and is so happy when he hears the bridegroom's voice—in the same way my happiness is now complete.

JHN03:30	He must become more important, and I must become less important.” 	Heg at am wo e maskogi mo hig woho d si s‑has haꞌichu. Kunt ahni im hu hab wabsh wo i ni‑junihi.” Neh, bash kaij g John. 
JHN03:31	He who comes from above is greater  than all; he who comes from the earth belongs to the earth and talks about earthly things. He who comes from heaven is greater than all.  	Nt ahni hab wo chei mo g John d wabsh oꞌodham ch am t‑ahgid mo haschu i neid ch ep kah ia jewed dahm.

JHN03:33-34	Yet anyone who accepts what he says confirms that God is truthful.  For the one God sent speaks God's words, because God doesn't restrict the Spirit.  	Jiosh at am cheha g e‑alidag mat ia wo jiwia jewed dahm k s‑baꞌama ab mah g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. K g alidaj heg hekaj ahg g neꞌokij.

JHN03:35	The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands.  	Jiosh o si pihk e elid ab e‑alidag wui ch wehs haꞌichu ab mah.  
JHN03:36	Anyone who trusts in the Son has eternal life, but anyone who refuses to trust the Son will not experience eternal life but remains under God's condemnation.

JHN04:1-2	When Jesus realized that the Pharisees had discovered that he was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John,  (although it wasn't Jesus who was baptizing, but his disciples),  	D baꞌich i muꞌi hemajkam ab him Jesus wui mo ab wui g John kch ab wecho e mashcham. Kuchd ahchim ha pahl wapkon mach ab si wecho t‑mashcham. D am i kah hegam Palasi ihda k an si i neneo.

JHN04:4	On the way he had to pass through Samaria.  	K eda idam ha shahgid chechkshani am hab chuꞌig g Samaria chekshani.  
JHN04:5-6	So he came to the Samaritan city of Sychar, near to the field that Jacob had given his son Joseph.  Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, who was tired from the journey, sat straight down beside the well. It was around noon. 	Kuchd heg am gai hihimad ch gam hu ai g Sychar kihhim mat am dahm juh. K am wawhiag miabidch g kihhim. D am dahiwua g Jesus gewkok natt pi mehk waꞌi hihi.  
JHN04:7-8	A Samaritan woman came to fetch water. Jesus said to her, “Please could you give me a drink?”  for his disciples had gone to the town to buy food. 	Kuchd ahchim gam hu hihi kihhim wui matt wo ha nolawt g haꞌichu hugi. D an hema i t‑bij g uwi waꞌigamedam k atsh am jiwia mo am daha g Jesus. 
JHN04:9	“You're a Jew, and I'm a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?” the woman replied, for Jews don't associate with Samaritans. 	Sh hab kaij g uwi, “Neh, dapki Tuhligo.

JHN04:10	Jesus answered her, “If you only recognized God's gift, and who is asking you, ‘Please could you give me a drink?’ you would have asked him and he would have given you the water of life.” 	Sh g Jesus hab epai kaij ab wui, “Ahpi apt aigo ab wo haꞌichu ni‑tai maptp wo s‑mahchk mani hedai wud ch haschu i m‑makiog.

JHN04:11	“Sir, you don't have a bucket, and the well is deep. Where are you going to get the water of life from?” she replied.  	Sh hab ep kaij g uwi, “Pt has hig masma wo waꞌi map pi ha kuhwo? K eda s‑juhk g wawhia.  
JHN04:12	“Our father Jacob gave us the well. He drank from it himself, as well as his sons and his livestock. Are you greater than he?” 	Aha nap baꞌich i gewkdag mo g t‑shohshon Jacobbad. Heg at ia wawhiat e‑oid ed k ia ihꞌehim g e‑aꞌaliga ha wehm ch haꞌichu e‑shoshoiga.” 
JHN04:13	Jesus answered, “Everyone who drinks water from this well will become thirsty again.  	Sh g Jesus hab kaij, “Huhume o g shuhdagi m‑waꞌigi. Kup ep tonommek.  
JHN04:14	But those who drink the water I give won't ever be thirsty again. The water I give becomes a bubbling spring of water inside them, bringing them eternal life.” 	T wabshaba pi hekid wo huhug hegai mani ahni m‑makiog.

JHN04:16	“Go and call your husband, and come back here,” Jesus told her. 	Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “Pegih, k ab wo i wai g e‑kun.” 
JHN04:17	“I don't have a husband,” the woman answered. 	Sh g uwi hab kaij, “Pi ani ha kun.” 
JHN04:18	“You've had five husbands, and the one you're living with now is not your husband. So what you say is true!” 	Hetasp ap waꞌi ha kuhkunkahim. K hegai map hemuch an wehm kih pi d m‑kun.”

JHN04:21	Jesus replied,  “Believe me the time is coming when you won't worship the Father either on this mountain or in Jerusalem.  	Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “Nt wo si shel m‑ahgi mo ab him g tash mat wabsh chum hebai wo e ihm g em‑ohg Jiosh, pi iia waꞌi id ab doꞌag o am Jerusalem t am.  
JHN04:22	You really don't know the God you're worshiping, while we worship the God we know, for salvation comes from the Jews.

JHN04:23	But the time is coming—and in fact it's here already—when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for these are the kind of worshipers the Father wants.  	E at ai g tash mat g hemajkam si e‑ihbdag amjed woho ab wo ihmad g e‑ohg Jiosh. Bo masma hab ha elid g Jiosh mat hab masma ab wo ihmad.

JHN04:25	The woman said, “Well, I know that the Messiah is coming,” (the one who is called Christ). “When he comes he will explain it all to us.” 	Sh am wabsh shaꞌi pi amichud g uwi ch hab kaij ab wui, “Heg ani hi wa s‑mahch mat wo jiwia hegai mo d Jiosh si Kehsha ch hab e aꞌaga Christ k wehs haꞌichu wo t‑ahgi.” 
JHN04:26	Jesus replied, “I AM—the one who is speaking to you.” 	Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “Dani ahni Jiosh si Kehsha.” 
JHN04:27	Just then the disciples returned. They were shocked that he was talking to a woman, but none of them asked “What are you doing?” or “Why are you talking with her?”  	Kuchd edapk i dada. D am wabsh kia wehmaj neok hegai uwi. Kuchd si has i t‑elid k wabshaba pi has shaꞌi kaij.

JHN04:30	So they went out of the town to go and see him.  	Kudki ab ha hekaj i hihi g hemajkam s‑neidamk g Jesus. 
JHN04:31	Meanwhile Jesus' disciples were urging him, “Rabbi, please eat something!” 	D koi e chehm g hemajkam, kuchd ab chum si ahgid g Jesus mat wo haꞌichu huh. 
JHN04:32	But Jesus replied, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.” 	D wabshaba hab kaij, “Am o haꞌichug g hab mahs gegosig mam ahpim pi shaꞌi mahch.” 
JHN04:33	“Did someone bring him food?” the disciples asked one another. 	Chd hab kaij ab aꞌai t‑wui, “A nat ia heki hu hema gegos?” 
JHN04:34	Jesus told them, “My food is to do the will of the One who sent me, and to complete his work.  	D hab kaij g Jesus ab t‑wui, “Ni‑gegosig o d ihda mant hab wo juh g Jiosh tatchui k wo nahto hegai chikpan mo ab ni‑mohtoꞌid.  
JHN04:35	Don't you have a saying, ‘four more months until harvest?’ Open your eyes and look around! The crops in the fields are ripe, ready for harvest.  	Neh, bo e chechꞌe mat g ha‑esha wo i e baꞌiha mat d wo giꞌik i mashadk. Nt wabshaba wo em‑chehgi mat hemu si s‑hohtam wo e baꞌiha haꞌichu.  
JHN04:36	The reaper is being paid and harvesting a crop for eternal life so that both the sower and the reaper can celebrate.  	Ahni ant am ei g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. Kumt ahpim wo ha baꞌiha hegam mat wo bei g pi ha huhugedam doakag. Kutt hekaj t‑wehm wo s‑hehgigk.  
JHN04:37	So the proverb ‘one sows, another reaps,’ is true.  	Id o heg wepogidas hab cheꞌidag mo hab chuꞌig, ‘Hema oꞌodham at am wo haꞌichu ei. T d wabsh wo hemak ch am wo hih g esha.’  
JHN04:38	I sent you to reap what you didn't work for. Others did the hard work and you have reaped the benefits of what they did.” 	Ab g wo neid hegam mo ab hihim. Pi amt ha ahgi g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga k wabshaba wo ha baꞌiha hegam mat wo e doꞌibia.” 
JHN04:39	Many Samaritans from that town trusted in him because of what the woman said: “He told me everything I ever did.”  	Kud wa muꞌijj hegam kihkam ab i s‑wohoch mo g Jesus d Jiosh si Kehsha heg hekaj mo hab kaij hegai uwi, “Heg o wehs ni‑ahgid mani has i ni‑wua.”  
JHN04:40	So when they came to see him they pleaded with him to stay with them. He stayed for two days,  	D heg hekaj ab si ahgid g Jesus am wui dadak mat wo si s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌid k am wo kia ha wehmajkahim heꞌekia tash. Kuchd wa woho am ha wehmajkahim gohk tash.  
JHN04:41	and because of what he told them many more trusted in him.  	D muꞌijj ab ep i s‑wohoch ab i kaiok g ahgaj  
JHN04:42	They said to the woman, “Now our trust in him isn't just because of what you told us but because we have heard him for ourselves. We're convinced that he really is the Savior of the world.” 	k hab hahawa kaij idam heg wui uwi, “B att hahawa si hejel kah k ab s‑wohochud k s‑mahch moki woho d wehs hemajkam t‑doꞌibiakam id dahm jewed.” 
JHN04:43	After the two days he continued on to Galilee.  	Kuchd amjed gam hu hahawa haꞌab hihi Galilee chekshani wui  
JHN04:44	Jesus himself had made the comment that a prophet is not respected in his own country.  	no pi hab kaij g Jesus, “No hu d wabsh i neida g Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam amai mo hebai d si kihj am jewed.”  
JHN04:45	But when he arrived in Galilee, the people welcomed him, because they had also been at the Passover feast and had seen everything he'd done in Jerusalem.  	D wabshaba muꞌijj g hemajkam amai ab haꞌichugkahim Jerusalem t ab ch wuhshad g t‑shohshon ha‑doꞌibiadag ch am neid g Jesus. Kud wa am hab wua g s‑hasig haꞌichu. D idam si s‑hehgig ch ab neid g Jesus matt ged hu dada. 
JHN04:46-47	He visited Cana in Galilee again, where he had turned water into wine. Nearby in the town of Capernaum lived a royal official whose son was very sick.  When he heard that Jesus had returned from Judea to Galilee, he went to Jesus and begged him to come and heal his son who was close to death. 	Kuchd oi wa gam hu haꞌab hihi Cana kihhim wui mat wa am si wehpeg hab juh g si s‑hasig haꞌichu mat wa wabsh g shuhdagi nawaitt.

JHN04:48	“Unless you see signs and wonders you people really won't trust me,” said Jesus. 	D hab wabsh kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Aha, namt pi hedai ab hu wo i s‑ni‑wohoch, mt hekid wo ipki nei mant hab wo juh g si s‑hasig haꞌichu?” 
JHN04:49	“Lord, just come before my child dies,” the official pleaded. 	D am hab waꞌap kaij g s‑has haꞌichu, “Ab g si i s‑ni‑hoꞌigeꞌid k wo ni‑oi am ni‑kih wui mat koi wo muh g ni‑aliga.” 
JHN04:50	“Go on home,” Jesus told him. “Your son will live!” 	D hab hahawa kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Gamai g s‑ap e tahtk hihm. T wo doa g m‑aliga.” 
JHN04:51	While he was on his way, his servants met him with the news that his son was alive and recovering.  	Sh am himad ch ab haꞌi ha nam g e‑pionag mash si s‑hehgig ch hab kaij, “Tki wo doa g m‑aliga.”  
JHN04:52	He asked them what time it was when his son began to get better. “Yesterday at one p.m. the fever left him,” they told him.  	Sh am hahawa ha kakke, “Heꞌekia ohla k ed at ab i apꞌetahi.” 
JHN04:53	Then the father realized this was the precise time when Jesus had told him, “Your son will live!” So he and everyone in his household trusted in Jesus.  	Sh am ha hekaj i chegito g ohgaj mo am d wabsh i si hegai ohla mo hab ahgid g Jesus, “T wo doa g m‑aliga.” Tsh ged hu jiwia e‑kih am k am si aꞌaga ihda g e‑wehm kihkam ha wehm. Tsh wehsijj ab i s‑wohoch mo g Jesus d Jiosh si Kehsha. 
JHN04:54	This was the second miraculous sign Jesus did after coming from Judea to Galilee. 	Neh, id o d i gokkokam s‑hasig haꞌichu mat hab juh g Jesus ia Galilee chekshani ch ed. 
JHN05:1	After this, there was a Jewish festival so Jesus went to Jerusalem.  	D am hahawa hema i e aihi g t‑mihshmda piast. Kuchd hekaj gam hu hihi Jerusalem wui. 
JHN05:2	Now near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem is a pool called Bethzatha in Hebrew, with five porches beside it.  	Am o hema woꞌog kihhim ch ed ch hab e aꞌaga Bethsada ch an miabidch hegai kolhai kihjeg mam an ha gagda g kahwal. K an hetasp wapttog heg wehgaj woꞌo.  
JHN05:3	Crowds of sick people were lying in these porches—those who were blind, lame, or paralyzed.  	K idam ha wecho shaꞌi muꞌi nahnko mahs kokꞌodam an woꞌowop ch haꞌi d pi neneadam ch haꞌi d pi hihimidkam ch haꞌi ab wabsh i s‑momoik. [Kush idam nenida g shuhdagi matsh am wo i hoi

JHN05:5	One man who was there had been sick for thirty-eight years. Jesus looked at him, knowing he had been lying there for long time, and asked him,  	D am hema woꞌo g oꞌodham ch waikko wehst‑mahm gamai gigiꞌik (34) aꞌahid ab waꞌi mumku.  
JHN05:6	“Do you want to be healed?” 	D g Jesus am neid ch s‑mahch mo tash am waꞌi woꞌo ch hab kaij ab wui, “Nap tatchua mapt wo doa?” 
JHN05:7	“Sir,” the sick man answered, “I don't have anyone to help me get into the pool when the water is stirred. While I'm trying to get there, someone always gets in before me.” 	D hab kaij g mumkudam, “Ni‑nawoj, pi o an hu hedaig mas am wo i ni‑huduni shuhdagi ch ed mo hekid am i hoike. Ni im hu haha wabsh i ni‑nakog mant am wo i hud, k gam hu heki hu hema ni‑baꞌiwichchek.” 
JHN05:8	“Stand up, pick up your mat, and start walking!” Jesus told him.  	D hab kaij g Jesus, “I wuhshani k am behꞌi g e‑wahkus k hihm!”  
JHN05:9	Immediately the man was healed. He picked up his mat and started walking. 	Neh, d ha hekaj doa k am bei g e‑wahkus k s‑ap hih. 
JHN05:10	So the Jews said to the man who'd been healed, “This is the Sabbath! It's against the law to carry a mat!” 	D haꞌi neid g t‑wehm oꞌodham ch hab ahg, “Neh, ahpi, melchkwua ap g t‑chehanig map kushwiotch g e‑wahkus. A nap pi mahch mo d mihshmda tash?” 
JHN05:11	“The man who healed me told me to pick up my mat and start walking,” he replied. 	D hab hahawa kaij hegai mo wa mumkuhim, “Hegai mat ni‑doaj o hab ni‑ahg mant am wo bei g ni‑wahkus k wo hih.” 
JHN05:12	“Who's this person who told you to carry your mat and walk?” they asked. 	D ab hahawa kakke mas hedai wud hegai mo hab ahg mat wo kushwiotk hih g e‑wahkus. 
JHN05:13	However the man who'd been healed didn't know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the surrounding crowd.  	D wabshaba am wabsh i pi e amich nad pi g Jesus im hu pi e mahsid hemajkam ha shahgid no pi shaꞌi muꞌijj g hemajkam amai. 
JHN05:14	Later on Jesus found the man in the Temple, and told him, “Look, now you've been healed. So stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.” 	D am hahawa g Jesus s‑neidam k am cheh geꞌe cheopi ch ed k hab ahg, “Neh, doa apt. Pi g am hu hab i ep junihim g pi apꞌekam nat pi haꞌichu baꞌich i pi ap hab wo e juh am m‑tahgio mapt am hab ep wo i junihi g pi apꞌekam.” 
JHN05:15	The man went and told the Jews it was Jesus who had healed him.  	D am i wuhshani k gam hu him k am ha ahgi moki d Jesus mat doaj. 
JHN05:16	So the Jews started to harass Jesus because he was doing things on the Sabbath.  	D am i s‑mai idam mash d Jesus mat hab juh ihda mihshmda tash ed k heg hekaj am i kudu ab neꞌowinch. 
JHN05:17	But Jesus told them, “My Father is still working, and so am I.” 	D g Jesus hab kaij ab ha wui, “Ni‑ohg Jiosh o chum hekid g s‑apꞌekam chikpan. Ni ahni hab waꞌap chum hekid hab ni‑wua.”  
JHN05:18	This was why the Jews tried even harder to kill him, for not only did he break the Sabbath but also called God his Father, making himself equal with God. 	D am hahawa i si e gewpkai mat wo mua nad pi am i kah mo hab masma ihm g Jiosh ch heg hekaj e wepogid g Jiosh. 
JHN05:19	Jesus explained to them, “I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can only do what he sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does the Son does as well.  	D hab hahawa kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Nt wo si shel em‑ahgi mani pi haꞌichu hejel hab wua ch wabshaba hab wua mo haschu g ni‑ohg Jiosh ni‑chehani.  
JHN05:20	For the Father loves the Son, and reveals to him everything he does; and the Father will show to him even more incredible things that will completely amaze you.  	Ni‑ohg o ab si pihk ni‑elid ch am ni‑chehgid mant has wo chum juni. T ab wo ni‑mah g gewkdag mant baꞌich i geꞌe haꞌichu hab wo juh mo ihda. Mt ab wabsh wo i hahaꞌadka.  
JHN05:21	For just as the Father gives life to those he resurrects from the dead, in the same way the Son also gives life to those that he wants.  	Ni‑ohg o i ha wuwhasid g koꞌi ab muhkig amjed ch ab ni‑mahkch g gewkdag mant s‑ap hab wo juh. Nt hekaj ab wo i ha wuwhas mani hedai hab i elid.  
JHN05:22	The Father judges no one. He has given to the Son all the authority to judge,  	K g ni‑ohg pi hedai ha lodait ch wabshaba ahni ab ni‑mah hegai apꞌedag mant wo ha lodai  
JHN05:23	so that everyone may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Anyone who doesn't honor the Son doesn't honor the Father who sent him.  	no pi hab elid mat wehsijj ab wo si has i ni‑el hab masma mo ab si has i elid g ni‑ohg. Am at i ni‑kei g Jiosh. T hedai pi ab hu has wo ni‑elidad ch hab wa masma pi ab hu has elid g ni‑ohg. 
JHN05:24	I tell you the truth: those who follow what I say and trust the One who sent me have eternal life. They won't be condemned, but have gone from death to life. 	“Do si wohokam ihda mant hab wo chei. T wo edagi g pi ha huhugedam doakag k am wo wehmajk g Jiosh hegam mat hedai ab wo kaihamad g haꞌichu ni‑ahga ch ab wo hiwgad g Jiosh. Pi ant ab hu wo ha mohtoꞌi g ha‑chuꞌijig mas hekaj gm hu hab wo i e juh ab amjed g Jiosh.  
JHN05:25	I tell you the truth: The time is coming—in fact it's here already—when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live!  	Nt wo si shel em‑ahgi mo ab him g tash, pej heki hu e ai, mant ab wo i ha wai g koꞌi ahni Jiosh alidag. T hegam mat ab i kaiha g haꞌichu ni‑ahga ab wo i wuwha.  
JHN05:26	Just as the Father has life-giving power in himself, so has he given the Son the same life-giving power in himself.  	Ni‑ohg o d hegai mo ab ha mahkch g doakag ch ab ni‑mahkch g gewkdag mant hab waꞌap wo ha mah g doakag.  
JHN05:27	The Father also granted the authority for judgment to him, for he is the Son of man.  	T ab ni‑mah g gewkdag mant ahni hab wo juh g lodaita nani pi d si Kehshaj. 
JHN05:28	Don't be surprised at this, for the time is coming when all those in the grave will hear his voice  	“Pi g am wo e totodsid id hekaj mani has i kaij. Ab o him g tash mat wehs g koꞌi s‑ap wo ni‑kah k ab wo i wuwha.  
JHN05:29	and will rise again: those who have done good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil to the resurrection of condemnation.  	Hegam mo hab junihim g s‑apꞌekam at ab wo i e wamgid k ab wo bei g e‑apꞌedag. T hegam mo hab junihim g pi apꞌekam ab wo i e wamgid k ab wo bei g s‑koꞌok e‑namkidadag.” 
JHN05:30	I can do nothing by myself. I judge based on what I'm told, and my decision is right, for I'm not doing my own will but the will of the One who sent me.  	D hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Pi ant wo shaꞌi ni‑nako mant hejel haꞌichu hab wo juh k wabshaba am si ni‑ohg oidk hab masma wo ha lodai. K hekaj hab s‑apꞌe g ni‑lodaita. 
JHN05:31	If I were to make claims about myself, such claims wouldn't be valid;  	“Pi amt wo mahchk manis am ahg g wohokam mantp wabsh hejel wo ni‑wohokamch.  
JHN05:32	but someone else gives evidence about me, and I know what he says about me is true.  	K heg hekaj am wa ni‑wehhejed neok g ni‑ohg Jiosh. Kuni s‑mahch mo d wohokam mo am ahg ab ni‑amjed. 
JHN05:33	You asked John about me, and he told the truth,  	“Neh, am amt wa haꞌi hihi heg wui John mo wa em‑pahl wapkonahim. K wa am em‑ahgid g wohokam.  
JHN05:34	but I don't need any human endorsement. I'm explaining this to you so you can be saved.  	Id ani hab wabsh kaij mamt hekaj wo e doꞌibia nam pi ahpim heg tatchua mat g oꞌodham am wo i wohokamch haꞌichu mamt ab haha wo i s‑wohoch. Ni ahni hi heki hu s‑mahch mani hedai wud ch pi shaꞌi tatchua mas am hema wo ge i ni‑wohokamch.  
JHN05:35	John was like a brightly-burning light, and you were willing to enjoy his light for a while.  	John o wa ahgachug g wohokam ch hekaj em‑tonlidch. Kumt wa haꞌijj ahpim heꞌes ab si s‑hohhoꞌi g haꞌichu ahgaj k an e hehemapaid wehgaj hab masma mat g huꞌul nahgi wo s‑hohhoꞌi g tonlig. 
JHN05:36	But the evidence I'm giving is greater than John's. For I am doing the work that the Father gave me to do,  	“John o s‑ap ni‑wohokamchud. K wabshaba ahni ab ni‑mahkch g Jiosh mani g s‑hasig haꞌichu hab wua. K id baꞌich i s‑ap ni‑wohokamchud mani d ni‑ohg kehsha.  
JHN05:37	and this is the proof that the Father sent me. The Father who sent me, he himself speaks on my behalf. You've never heard his voice, and you've never seen what he looks like,  	Pi am hekid neid g Jiosh. K pi hekid ab hu em‑wuhiosha neid ch neok ch wabshaba am ni‑wohokamchud mani d kehshaj.  
JHN05:38	and you don't accept what he says, because you don't trust in the one he sent. 	Am o ni‑wohokamchud g Jiosh mani d si Kehshaj. Kum eda pi ab hu ni‑tatchua nam ge wohochud.  
JHN05:39	You search the Scriptures because you think that through them you'll gain eternal life. But the evidence they give is in support of me!  	Am am si hoan g Jiosh oꞌohana nam pi tatchua mamt wo e doꞌibia k wo edgidad g pi ha huhugedam doakag. K g Jiosh oꞌohana am ni‑wohokamchud  
JHN05:40	And yet you don't want to come to me so that you might live.  	mani ahni d em‑doꞌibiakam. M eda pi ab hu ni‑hiwig. 
JHN05:41	I'm not looking for human approval  	“Neh, pi ani heg nenꞌoid mas g hemajkam ab wo si ni‑haꞌichuch. Jiosh at ab wo si ni‑haꞌichuch.  
JHN05:42	—I know you, and that you don't have God's love in you.  	Kuni s‑em‑amichud ch s‑mahch mam pi ab hu shaꞌi tatchua g Jiosh.  
JHN05:43	For I've come to represent my Father, and you won't accept me; but if someone comes representing themselves, then you accept them!  	Ia ant jiwia g ni‑ohg si wehhejed. Kum pi ab hu has ni‑elid. Hegam at ab has d wo em‑elidak matp hedam wabsh hejel e wehhejed ab wo i wuwha.

JHN05:45	But don't think I will be making accusations about you to the Father. It's Moses who is accusing you, the one in whom you place such confidence.  	Ni wabshaba pi d ahni manis ab wo haꞌichu em‑abch am ni‑ohg wui. Mosesbad chehanig am ab hiwig. K d hegai mat am wo tashogi g pi ap em‑chuꞌijig.  
JHN05:46	For if you really trusted Moses you would trust in me, because he wrote about me.  	Mosesbad at haꞌichu oꞌoha ab ni‑amjed. Kumt ab wo s‑ni‑wohoch mamt hems woho ab wo s‑wohochudad g Mosesbad oꞌohana.  
JHN05:47	But since you don't trust what he said, why would you trust what I say?” 	Pi amt has masma ab hu wo s‑wohoch g ni‑ahga namki pi woho wohochud mat haschu an oꞌoha g Mosesbad.” Neh, bad kaij g Jesus am ha mihshmadch.

JHN06:4	The time for the Jewish festival of the Passover was approaching.  	D eda e aihim mat wo e wuhshad g t‑shohshon ha‑doꞌibiadag.  
JHN06:5	When Jesus looked up, and saw a large crowd coming towards him, he asked Philip, “Where can we buy enough bread to feed all these people?”  	Kud muꞌi hegam mad gam hu wo piasto ab i hihi s‑kaimkch g Jesus. 
JHN06:6	He only asked this to see how Philip would respond, because Jesus already knew what he was going to do. 	Bo kaij ch wabsh s‑aꞌappemamk g Philip no pi wa chum s‑mahch mat has masma hab wo juh. 
JHN06:7	“Two hundred silver coins wouldn't buy enough bread to give everyone even just a little,” Philip replied. 	D hab kaij g Philip, “Pi att wo shaꞌi t‑nako. Chum achs hems gohk siant pihshkaj wo ui g pahn, t eda pi wo ha ai g haꞌakia hemajkam.” 
JHN06:8	One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up.  	D hegai mo d Simon Peter nawoj ch hab chehgig Andrew hab kaij,  
JHN06:9	“There's a boy here who has five barley loaves and a couple of fish, but what good is that when there are so many people?” 	“Ia o hema haꞌichug g ali ch hi wa hetasp sismito ch gohk waptopi uꞌa. T wabshaba pi haꞌichu ab hu wo shaꞌi ha nako haꞌakia hemajkam ha wehhejed”. 
JHN06:10	“Have everybody sit down,” Jesus said. There was plenty of grass there, so they all sat down, the men numbering around five thousand.

JHN06:11	Jesus took the bread, gave thanks, and had it handed out to the people as they sat there. Then he did the same with the fishes, making sure the people had as much as they wanted.  	D g Jesus am ui g sismito k ab hoꞌigeꞌel g Jiosh k ab t‑mah. Kuchd ahchim an hahawa i ha mahkhi g hemajkam. D hab waꞌap juh hegam gohk waptopi. Kuchd wehsijj hug k si s‑kokwod.

JHN06:13	So they collected and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves the people had eaten.  	Kuchd an i uꞌihim k gamai gohk wapshomi ha shuhshud heg hekaj wihpiꞌidag.

JHN06:15	Jesus realized that they were about to force him to become their king, so he left them and went up into the hills to be by himself. 	D g Jesus ha amich mat an wabsh wo si be k wo geꞌe kownalch k hekaj gam hu hejel baꞌich i chesh doꞌag t ab. 
JHN06:16	When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,  	Hudunihim o g tash. Kuchd gam hu i huhud

JHN06:18	A strong wind began blowing and the sea grew rough.  	D g s‑gewk hewel ab i med k ab i kudu g shuhdagi.  
JHN06:19	When they had rowed three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea, coming towards the boat. They were very frightened.  	Kuchd am himchud g wahlko am hu i giꞌik mihya. D ab haha wabsh hema him t‑wui an wabsh shuhdagi dahm. Kuchd hab i neidok si t‑totods.

JHN06:22	The next day the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea noticed that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had not got into the boat with his disciples, but they had left without him.

JHN06:23-24	Then other boats arrived from Tiberias, landing near to the place where they'd eaten the bread once the Lord had blessed it.  Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went over to Capernaum, looking for Jesus.  	D idam an chum gagahim ch pi cheh g Jesus k nei matt pi am hu ep dada. D oi wa am i haꞌi dada g wapalko ab Tiberias kihhim t amjed miabidk mat am ha gegos g Jesus hegam muꞌi hemajkam.

JHN06:26	“I tell you the truth,” Jesus replied, “you're looking for me because you ate as much bread as you wanted, not because you understood the miracles.

What he wants is for me not to lose anyone he has given to me, but for me to raise them up at the last day. What my Father wants is for everyone who sees the Son and trusts in him to have eternal life, and for me to raise them up at the last day.” 	Do ni‑ohg tatchui mamt ab ni‑wui wo i e dagito ch hab wo edagi g pi ha huhugedam doakag.

JHN06:59	Jesus explained this while he was teaching in a synagogue at Capernaum.  	Neh, bad kaij g Jesus mad eda am ha mashcham g hemajkam ha‑cheopi ed amai Capernaum t am.

Kum eda haꞌijj pi ab hu ni‑wohochud.” Neh, bo kaij g Jesus no pi s‑mahch mat hedam pi ab hu wo wohoch ch ep s‑mahch mat hedai wo gagda mat wo e muhkid.

JHN06:66	From this time on many of Jesus' disciples gave up and no longer followed him.  	D muꞌijj hegam mo am t‑wehm oid g Jesus dagito am i kaiok g s‑hasig haꞌichu ahgaj k pi dahm an hu hahawa ep wehmaj.  
JHN06:67	Then Jesus asked the twelve disciples, “What about you? Do you want to leave as well?” 	D heg hekaj hab kaij g Jesus ab t‑wui ahchim gamai gohk, “Mt ahpim has wo e juh? Namt hab waꞌap wo ni‑dagito?” 
JHN06:68	Simon Peter answered, “Lord, who would we follow? You're the one who has the words of eternal life.  	D g Simon Peter hab kaij ab wui, “T‑kownalig, pi o an hu hedai ehp machs heg wui wo hihi. Ahpi ap waꞌi am ahgachug hegai matt hekaj wo bei g pi ha huhugedam doakag.

JHN07:1	After this, Jesus spent his time going from place to place in Galilee. He did not want to do so in Judea because the Jews were out to kill him.  	Am amsh chum s‑muꞌamk g Jesus Judea chekshani ch ed. D hekaj pi am hu himimk. Kuchd an oiopo Galilee chekshani ch ed.  
JHN07:2	But as it was almost time for the Jewish festival of the Tabernacles,  	D eda e aihim hegai piast mach ab ihm g Jiosh mo babhaijid g t‑eꞌes.  
JHN07:3	his brothers told him, “You ought to leave and go to Judea so your followers will be able to see what miracles you can do.  	D heg hekaj hab kaij g Jesus wepnag ab wui, “Pt hems gm hu wo hih iꞌajed Judea wui. T wo nei g s‑hasig m‑chikpan hegam mo wa an m‑oidahim Judea ch ed.

JHN07:5	For even his own brothers really didn't believe in him. 	Neh, bad kaij noki pi koi wohochud mo d Jiosh si Kehsha. 
JHN07:6-8	Jesus told them, “This is not my time to go, not yet; but you can go whenever you want, for any time's the right time for you.  The world has no reason to hate you, but it does hate me, because I make it clear that its ways are evil.  You go on to the festival. I'm not going to this festival because this is not the right time for me, not yet.”  	D hab kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Pi ant am hu wo em‑oi id wui gegosig nat pi koi e ai mant am wo si s‑ap i ni‑maskogi.

JHN07:9	After saying this he stayed behind in Galilee. 	Neh, bad kaij ab ha wui ch am wabsh i wih Galilee ch ed. 
JHN07:10	After his brothers left to go to the festival, Jesus also went, but not openly—he stayed out of sight.  	Heg i dahm mad gam hu hihi g Jesus wepnag, d am hahawa epai him k wabshaba wabsh s‑aꞌagi. Kuchd ahchim gam hu i oi.  
JHN07:11	Now at the festival the Jewish leaders were searching for him and kept on asking, “Where is he?”  	Sh hegam mo d hahaꞌichu am Judea ch ed an gahg ch an kaiam mas hebai has chuꞌig. 
JHN07:12	Many people in the crowds were complaining about him. Some said, “He's a good man,” while others argued, “No! He deceives people.”  	D eda an s‑juꞌujpij neneok g hemajkam ch hab kaij, “Do si s‑ap oꞌodham.” 
JHN07:13	But no one dared to speak openly about him because they were afraid of what the Jewish leaders would do to them. 	K wabshaba s‑aꞌagi an aꞌaga no pi s‑ha ehbid g hahaꞌichu. 
JHN07:14	When the festival was halfway through Jesus went to the Temple and began to teach.  	Kud eda hugkam waꞌi hih g piast. D am hih g Jesus geꞌe cheopi wui k am i ha mashcha.  
JHN07:15	The Jewish leaders were very surprised, and asked, “How does this man have so much learning when he hasn't been educated?” 	D hegam hahaꞌichu si has i elid k hab kaij, “S has hig masma geꞌe haꞌichu s‑mahch ihda oꞌodham mat eda pi shaꞌi e mashcha g papal ha‑mashchama?” 
JHN07:16	Jesus answered, “My teaching is not from me but from the One who sent me.  	D hab kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Jiosh at ab ni‑cheha mant ia wo jiwia jewed dahm. K d Jiosh mashchamadag ihda mani i ha mashcham.

JHN07:18	Those who speak for themselves want to glorify themselves, but someone who glorifies the one who sent him is truthful and not deceitful.

JHN07:21	“I did one miracle and you're all shocked by it,” Jesus replied.  	D hab kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Woho am s‑ni‑muꞌamk. Ha ant dodaj mihshmda tash ed. Kum heg hekaj s‑ni‑muꞌamk.  
JHN07:22	“However because Moses told you to circumcise—not that it really came from Moses, but from your forefathers before him—you perform circumcision on the Sabbath.

JHN07:25	Then some of those from Jerusalem began wondering, “Isn't this the one they're trying to kill?  	D haꞌijj hab kaij g Jerusalem t am kihkam, “Aha no hig pi woho d ihda mam chum s‑muꞌamk.  
JHN07:26	But see how openly he's speaking, and they're saying nothing to him. Do you think the authorities believe he's the Messiah?  	K eda haschu ahgch pi hedai has ahg? K ia t‑jehnigid. Aha no hab elid g hahaꞌichu mo wa woho d Jiosh si Kehsha?  
JHN07:27	But that's not possible because we know where he comes from. When the Messiah comes, nobody will know where he's from.” 	S has hig masma d wo hegaik mach eda s‑mahch mo hedai d amjedkam ch hebai d kihkam. Kutsh wa eda g Jiosh si Kehsha pi hedai wo mahchk mat hebaijed ia wo jiwia.” 
JHN07:28-29	While he was teaching in the Temple, Jesus called out in a loud voice, “So you think you know me and where I'm from? However I did not come for my own sake. The One who sent me is true. You don't know him,  but I know him, for I come from him, and he sent me.” 	D si s‑kaidam hab kaij g Jesus, “Pegih, s‑mahch am mani hedai wud ch hebaijed him.

JHN07:30	So they tried to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him because his time had not yet come.  	Kumd am hahawa chum bei. T wabshaba pi koi e ai g tashgaj. D pi e nako idam.  
JHN07:31	However many of the crowd did put their trust in him. “When the Messiah appears, will he do more miraculous signs than this man has done?” they said.  	Kud muꞌi ab i s‑wohochud k wabsh s‑juꞌujpij hab kaij ab aꞌai e wui, “Naꞌas woho d Jiosh si Kehsha nat pi pi hedai wo shaꞌi e nako mas hab wo juh hegai hab mahs s‑hasig haꞌichu mo ihda hab wua.” 
JHN07:32	When the Pharisees heard the crowd whispering this about him, they and the chief priests sent guards to arrest Jesus. 	D am haꞌi oiopo g Palasi ch am i kah hegai mo hab e kaij k am hihim k atsh am ha ahgi g uꞌugchu papal. Tsh hegam am ha cheha g geꞌe cheopi nuhkuddam mat an wo bei g Jesus. 
JHN07:33	Then Jesus told the people, “I'll be with you just a little longer, but then I'll return to the One who sent me.  	D hab kaij g Jesus, “Pi ant shaꞌi tash ia hu wo em‑wehmajkahim ch gam hu hahawa uhpam wo hih heg wui mat ia i ni‑ahꞌad.

JHN07:35	The Jews said to each other, “Where could he be going that we couldn't find him? Is he planning to go to those scattered among the foreigners, and teach the foreigners?  	D am wabsh i pi amich g hemajkam k hab kaij ab aꞌai e wui, “A t hebai wo hih, chs hab pi wo edagi?” 
JHN07:36	What does he mean by saying, ‘You'll search for me but you won't find me; and you can't come where I'm going’?” 	A shahꞌo d ahga mo hab kaij matt wo chum gahgad ch wabshaba pi wo edgid k pi wo t‑nako machs am wo hihi mat hebai wo haꞌichugk.” 
JHN07:37	On the last and most important day of the festival, Jesus stood up and shouted out in a loud voice, “If you're thirsty, come to me and drink.  	D am i e ai g si oidchkam tash mo baꞌiwechkim d si geꞌe tash heg eda piast. D am e hemapadch g hemajkam.

JHN07:39	He was referring to the Spirit that those who trusted in him would later receive. The Spirit hadn't been given yet because Jesus hadn't yet been glorified. 	Bo kaij g Jesus ch hab ahg matt ab wui wo i t‑dagito k hekaj wo bei g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag.

JHN07:40	When they heard these words, some of the people said, “This man is definitely the Prophet!” 	D muꞌi hab kaij am i kaiok, “Ihda oꞌodham oki d wa woho hegai Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam mach nenida.” 
JHN07:41	Others said, “He is the Messiah!” Still others said, “How can the Messiah come from Galilee?  	D hai hab ep kaij, “Doki Jiosh si Kehsha.” 
JHN07:42	Doesn't Scripture say that the Messiah comes from David's lineage, and from David's home town of Bethlehem?”  	K eda an hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed matsh g Jiosh si Kehsha ab d wo t‑kownaligbad David amjedkamk ch ab wo amjedk g Bethlehem kihhim.

JHN07:43	So the crowd had a strong difference of opinion about him.  	D heg hekaj ab aꞌai e wui gegokiwua g hemajkam.

JHN08:7	They kept on demanding an answer, so he stood up and told them, “Whichever one of you has never sinned may throw the first stone at her.”  	D oi wa idam pi dagito k ab ep kakke.

JHN08:12	Jesus spoke again to the people, telling them, “I am the light of the world. If you follow me you won't walk in darkness for you will have the life-giving light.” 	D hab ep kaij g Jesus ab ha wui g hemajkam, “Dani geꞌe tonlig am wehs ha wehhejed g hemajkam.

JHN08:19	“Where is your father?” they asked him. 	D ab kakke idam, “A k hebai has chuꞌig g m‑ohg?” 
JHN08:20	Jesus explained this while he was teaching near the Temple treasury. Yet no one arrested him because his time had not yet come.

JHN08:24	That is why I told you that you'll die in your sins. For if you don't trust in me, the ‘I am,’ you'll die in your sins.” 	Kum eda pi ni‑wohochud mani d ge ahni. Ni heg hekaj am em‑ahgid mamt wo koi pi e doꞌibiak.” 
JHN08:25	Then they asked him, “Who are you?” 	D ab kakke, “Kup hedai wud higi?”

JHN08:27	They didn't understand that he was talking to them about the Father. So Jesus explained to them: 	D idam pi amichud mo g Jiosh hab ahg. 
JHN08:28	“When you have lifted up the Son of man then you'll know that I am the ‘I am,’ and that I do nothing of myself, but only say what the Father taught me.

JHN08:30	Many who heard Jesus say these things put their trust in him. 	T muijj hegam mat ab kah ihda ab i s‑wohoch.

JHN08:33	“We're descendants of Abraham! We've never been slaves to anyone,” they answered. “How can you say that we'll be set free?” 	D haꞌi hab kaij, “Pi ach hekid hedai d shaꞌi neneholiga nach pi d Abrahambad amjedkam. P haschu hab ahg ch hab kaij matt hahawa pi d wo neneholk?”

JHN08:39	“Abraham is our father,” they answered. 	D hab kaij ab wui, “Pi ach d ge Jiawul amjedkam. Abrahambad o d t‑shohshon.” 
JHN08:40	“But you are trying to kill me now, because I told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham would never have done that.  	M eda am e nakog mamt wo ni‑mua ahni mani heg waꞌi em‑ahgid wohokam mo g Jiosh ab ni‑ahgid.

JHN08:42	Jesus replied, “If God really was your father, you would love me. I came from God and now I am here. The decision to come wasn't mine, but the One who sent me.  	D hab kaij g Jesus, “Ia ant jiwia ab amjed g Jiosh. Kumt heg hekaj ab wo si ni‑tatchuad mamtp woho d wo aꞌaligajk. Pi ant wabsh hejel hab i ni‑ah mant ab wo i hih. Jiosh at ab ni‑chea.

JHN08:44	Your father is the Devil, and you love to follow your father's evil desires. He was a murderer from the beginning. He never stood for the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies he reveals his true character, for he's a liar and the father of lies.  	Dam wabsh ge jiawul amjedkam ch s‑hohhoꞌid mamt am hab wo wuad g tatchuij.

JHN08:59	At this they picked up stones to stone him, but Jesus was hidden from them and he left the Temple. 	Neh, d gan hu i uꞌihi g hohodai mat hekaj wo maꞌichkwua g Jesus. D wabshaba wabsh s‑aꞌagi am ha shahgid him k gam hu i wuhsh geꞌe cheopi amjed.

JHN09:2	His disciples asked him, “Rabbi, why was this man born blind? Was it him who sinned, or was it his parents?” 	Kuchd ab kakke g Jesus, “Neh, t‑mashchamdam, dohꞌo d chuꞌijig mo d pi neadam ihda oꞌodham? No d hejel chuꞌijigaj aha no d geꞌegedgaj ha‑chuꞌijig?” 
JHN09:3	Jesus replied, “It wasn't because the man or his parents sinned. But so that what God can do may be shown in his life,  	D hab kaij g Jesus, “Id o pi hab d shaꞌi ahga mas d ha‑chuꞌijig. Heg o hekaj pi nea mat g Jiosh am wo chehgi g e‑gewkdag ab amjed.

JHN09:5	While I'm here in the world I am the light of the world.” 	Dani tonlig am em‑wehhejed mani ia em‑wehmaj.” 
JHN09:6	After he'd said this, Jesus spat on the ground and made some mud with the saliva which he put on the man's eyes.  	D hab cheꞌiok g Jesus k am siswua jewed dahm k am hab juh g bid k hekaj ab bidsh g wuhpuij hegai pi neadam  
JHN09:7	Then Jesus told him, “Go and wash in the Pool of Siloam” (which means “sent”). So the man went and washed, and when he went home he could see. 	k hab ahg, “Am g him k ab i wakon g e‑wuhiosha heg eda woꞌo mo hab e aꞌaga Siloam.” (K hab d ahga ihda “I Ahꞌad.”) T wa woho am hih ihda pi neadam k am wako g e‑wuhiosha k am i uhpam jiwia s‑ap haꞌichu neidch.

JHN09:10	“So how is it you can see?” they asked him. 	Kumd ab ep kakke, “Shahpt masma nent?” 
JHN09:11	He replied, “A man called Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes and told me, ‘Go and wash yourself in the Pool of Siloam.’ So I went and washed, and now I can see.” 	D hab kaij, “Hegai mash d Jesus at ab bidsh g ni‑wuhpui am jewedo siswuak k hab ni‑ahg mant wo him k wo wako g ni‑wuhiosha am Siloam woꞌo ch ed.

JHN09:12	“Where is he?” they asked. 	D hab kaij idam, “T hebai hih?” 
JHN09:13	They took the man who had been blind to the Pharisees.  	D am wa haꞌi bei ihda oꞌodham mo wa pi nea am Palasi ha wui.  
JHN09:14	Now it was the Sabbath when Jesus had made the mud and opened the blind man's eyes.  	K d t‑mihshmda tash mad eda g Jesus hab juh ihda.  
JHN09:15	So the Pharisees also asked him how he could see. He told them, “He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and now I can see.” 	D g Palasi ab hahawa kakke mas has masma nent. 
JHN09:16	Some of the Pharisees said, “The man who did this can't be from God because he doesn't keep the Sabbath.” But others wondered, “How could a sinner do such miracles?” So they were divided in their opinion. 	D haꞌi hab kaij hegam Palasi, “Neh, pi o ab hu shaꞌi Jiosh amjed nat pi melchkwua g t‑chehanig hab juhk ihda t‑mihshmda tash ed.” 
JHN09:17	So they went on questioning the man. “What's your opinion about him, then, since it's your eyes he opened,” they asked. 	D heg hekaj ab ep si kakke hegam Palasi, “Shahp i elid hegai oꞌodham map hab kaij mat m‑nench.” 
JHN09:18	The Jewish leaders still refused to believe that the man who had been blind could now see until they had called in the man's parents. 	D wabshaba pi wohochud idam hahaꞌichu mas wa woho d pi neadam ch am ha waid g geꞌegedgaj  
JHN09:19	They asked them, “Is this your son whom you say was born blind? So how is it that now he can see?” 	ch muꞌi haꞌichu ha kakke mas d ha‑aliga ihda ch ga hu i e‑mahsidag amjed pi nea, kch ehp mas has masma hahawa haꞌichu neid.

JHN09:22-23	The reason his parents said this was because they were afraid of what the Jewish leaders would do. The Jewish leaders had already announced that anyone who declared that Jesus was the Messiah would be thrown out of the synagogue.  That was why his parents said, “Ask him, he's old enough.” 	Hegam hahaꞌichu ad wa am heki hu apꞌech mat pi wo ha hiwigi mat am hu ep wo i wahp cheopi ch ed hegam mat hedam hab wo chei mo g Jesus d Jiosh si Kehsha.

JHN09:26	Then they asked him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?” 	D idam ab hahawa ep kakke, “T has m‑juh k m‑nench?” 
JHN09:27	The man replied, “I already told you. Weren't you listening? Why do you want to hear it again? You don't want to become his disciples too, do you?” 	D hab kaij, “M ani wa heki hu em‑ahgid.

JHN09:33	If this man weren't from God, he could do nothing.” 	T hi wo wa e nako hema mat hab wo juh ihda hab mahs haꞌichu matp ab Jiosh amjed wo himad.” 
JHN09:34	“You were born totally sinful, and yet you're trying to lecture us,” they replied. And they threw him out of the synagogue.

JHN09:35	When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, he went and found the man, and asked him, “Do you trust in the Son of man?” 	D kah g Jesus mamt i wuhshad k am i gahghim k hab kaij am i chehgiok, “Nap ab si hiwig g Jiosh si Kehsha?” 
JHN09:36	The man replied, “Tell me who he is, sir, so I can put my trust in him.” 	D hab kaij ihda oꞌodham, “A k hedai wud. Am g ni‑ahgid. Nt ab wo si i hiw.” 
JHN09:37	“You've already seen him. He's the one speaking with you now!” Jesus told him. 	D hab kaij g Jesus, “Dani ahni map hahawa s‑ap ni‑neid mant wa m‑nench.” 
JHN09:38	“I trust you, Lord!” he said, and he kneeled in worship before Jesus. 	D ab si i gei wui k hab kaij, “Ab ani si m‑hiwig, s‑apꞌekam ni‑kownalig.” 
JHN09:39	Then Jesus told him, “I've come into the world to bring judgment so that those who are blind may see, and those who see will become blind.” 	D hab hahawa kaij g Jesus, “Ia ant jiwia jewed dahm mant wo mahsko wua mo hedai pi nea ch hedai s‑nea id eda Jiosh apꞌedag.” 
JHN09:40	Some Pharisees who were there with Jesus asked him, “We're not blind too, are we?” 	D haꞌi am gegok g Palasi ch si has i elid k hab kaij, “Nap ahchim hab ep chum t‑ahg mach hab waꞌap pi nenea.” 
JHN09:41	Jesus answered, “If you were blind, you wouldn't be guilty. But now that you say you see, your guilt remains.” 	D hab kaij g Jesus, “Pi amt ab hu wo em‑abch mamtp wo wohokamch mam pi nenea am Jiosh apꞌedag ed. M wabshaba hab chum kaij mam s‑nenea.” 
JHN10:1	“I tell you the truth, anyone who doesn't come in through the gate of the sheepfold but climbs in some other way is a thief and a robber.  	D hab ep kaij g Jesus, “No hig pi woho mat g s‑chu ehskam wabsh s‑aꞌagi haskojed ab wo i wah heg eda kolhai mam am ha nuhkud g kahwal k wo s‑ha ehsidam?  
JHN10:2	The one who comes in through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.  	T wabshaba g si ha nuhkuddam ab wo i wah kihjeg amjed.  
JHN10:3	The gatekeeper opens it for him, and the sheep respond to his voice. He calls his own sheep by name, and leads them out.  	T g kihjeg nuhkuddam ab wo i kuhpiꞌoki. K g ha nuhkuddam am si ha chehcheg ch gam hu i ha wanimed.  
JHN10:4	After bringing them out, he walks ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they recognize his voice.  	T am wo i wuwhag k gam hu wo i oi no pi s‑mahch g neꞌokij. T am ha baꞌich wo himad.  
JHN10:5	They won't follow strangers. In fact they run away from a stranger because they don't recognize the voice of strangers.” 	Pi at hedai ep wo i oi no pi pi mahch g ha‑neꞌoki k wabsh wo e gantad.”  
JHN10:6	When Jesus gave this illustration those who were listening to him didn't understand what he meant.  	Neh, id ad hekaj am chum haꞌichu ha mashcham g Jesus. D wabshaba pi shaꞌi amichud mo haschu hab ahg. 
JHN10:7	So Jesus explained again, “I tell you the truth: I am the gate of the sheepfold.  	D heg hekaj hab ep kaij, “Ahni ani hab ni‑ahg ch ni‑wepogid g kolhai kihjeg.  
JHN10:8	All those who came before me were thieves and robbers, but the sheep didn't listen to them.  	Hegam mo hab e aꞌaga mo d em‑wanimeddam ch eda pi ab hu ni‑wohochud o d s‑chu eꞌeskam ch d ha muꞌakam. K wabshaba g ni‑wohochuddam pi ab hu ha kaiham.

JHN10:11	I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.  	nani pi s‑wohom d em‑nuhkuddam. 
JHN10:12	The man paid to look after the sheep is not the shepherd and he runs away when he sees the wolf coming. He abandons the sheep because they're not his, and the wolf attacks and scatters the flock  	Hegai mo d wabsh ha‑pionag at am wabsh wo i ha dagito k wo meh mat am wo jiwia g shehꞌe.

JHN10:13	for the man is only working for pay and doesn't care about the sheep.  	Pion at wo heb hu meh no pi pi ha tatchua g ha‑shoshoiga. 
JHN10:14-15	I am the good shepherd. I know who are mine, and they know me,  just as the Father knows me and I know him. I lay down my life for the sheep.  	“Nt eda ahni wo i nako g shoꞌigdag am ha wehhejed g ni‑wohochuddam hab masma mo g si ha nuhkuddam g kahwal chum anis wo ni‑muhkid am ha wehhejed.

JHN10:17	This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life so I may take it up again.  	“Am ant wabsh wo i ni‑dagito muhkig wui. K g ni‑ohg heg hekaj si ni‑tatchua. Nt ab uhpam ep wo i ni‑chegito.  
JHN10:18	No one takes it from me; I choose to lay it down. I have the right to give it up, and I have the right to take it back. This is the command my Father gave me.” 	Pi at hedai wo shaꞌi e nako mas wabsh hejel wo e elid k wo ni‑mua. Uꞌukch ani g ni‑apꞌedag mant am wo i ni‑dagito muhkig wui k ab uhpam ep wo i ni‑chegito.

JHN10:19	The Jews were again divided in their opinion about Jesus over these words.  	D am ep aꞌai e neꞌowi g hemajkam heg hekaj mo has i kaij.  
JHN10:20	Many of them said, “He's demon-possessed! He's mad! Why are you listening to him?”  	Kud muꞌijj hab nahnko kaij babgatk, “Doki wabsh jiawul. Pi o wehsig. Shahchu am ahgch ab kaiham?” 
JHN10:21	Others said, “These aren't the words of someone who's demon-possessed. Besides, a demon can't open eyes that are blind.” 	D wabshaba haꞌijj hab epai kaij, “Pi at wo e nako hegai mo d wabsh sha jiawul mas hab kaidam s‑kehg wo neokad ch wo nench g pi neadam.” 
JHN10:22	It was winter, and the time of the Festival of Dedication in Jerusalem.  	D am i e ai g geꞌe cheopi wakonadag tash. D eda d s‑hehpichꞌedkam.  
JHN10:23	Jesus was walking in the Temple through Solomon's porch. The Jews surrounded him, asking,  	Kuchd am oiopo anai mo hab e aꞌaga Solomonbad watto am geꞌe cheopi t am.

JHN10:25	Jesus replied, “I already told you but you refuse to believe it. The miracles I do in my Father's name prove who I am.  	D hab kaij g Jesus, “Heki ani hu am em‑ahgid. M eda pi ni‑wohochud.

JHN10:31	Once again the Jews picked up stones to stone him. 	D g hemajkam am ep uꞌihi g hohodai mat wo maꞌichkwua. 
JHN10:32	Jesus said to them, “You've seen many good deeds that I've done from the Father. Which one are you stoning me for?” 	D hab kaij g Jesus, “Muꞌi ant haꞌichu hab juh g s‑apꞌekam nat pi ab ni‑mah g ni‑ohg g gewkdag. K haschu d hegai mamt heg hekaj wo ni‑maꞌichkwua?” 
JHN10:33	The Jews replied, “We're not stoning you for a good deed, but for blasphemy because you are just a man but you're claiming to be God.” 	D hab kaij g hemajkam, “Pi ach heg hekaj s‑m‑maꞌichkwuimk s‑apꞌekam ch wabshaba heg hekaj map pad neok. Dap wabsh oꞌodham ch eda hab chum aꞌaga g Jiosh mo d si m‑ohg ch hab ab chum e wepogid g Jiosh.” 
JHN10:34-35	Jesus answered them, “Isn't it written in your law, ‘I said, you are gods’? He called those people ‘gods,’ the people to whom the word of God came—and Scripture can't be altered.  	D hab kaij g Jesus, “An o oꞌohanas em‑chehanig ed mo g Jiosh hab ha aꞌaga jijosh hegam mo uꞌachug g haꞌichu ahgaj, chum as d wabsh hemajkam.  
JHN10:36	So why are you saying the one whom the Father set apart and sent into the world is blaspheming because I said ‘I am the Son of God’?  	T wahm ahni hig woho am si i ni‑kehsh k ia i ni‑ahꞌad id dahm jewed. M eda haschu ahgch hab ni‑ahg mani pad neok mani hab kaij mani d Jiosh alidag?

JHN10:38	But if that is what I'm doing, even though you don't believe me, you should believe because of the evidence of what I've done. That way you can know and understand that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father.” 	Ni wabshaba am hab junihim. Mt heg hekaj wo s‑mahchk mach d hemako g ni‑ohg wehm.” 
JHN10:39	Once again they tried to arrest him, but he escaped from them.  	D g hahaꞌichu am hahawa ep chum cheha g cheopi nuhkuddam mat am wo hihim k wo bei. D wabshaba ep e doꞌibia ab ha amjed. 
JHN10:40	He went back across the Jordan River to the place where John had begun baptizing, and he stayed there.  	Kuchd gam hu hahawa hihim k gam hu ai g Jordan Akimel k am aigo i chehchsh k am dada mo wa g Johnbad am ha pahl wapkon k am dadha.

JHN10:42	Many who were there put their trust in Jesus. 	D muꞌi hemajkam ab i s‑wohoch g Jesus amai. 
JHN11:1	A man named Lazarus was sick. He lived in Bethany with his sisters Mary and Martha.  	Am ad wa hema kih Bethany kihhim t am ch hab chehgig Lazarus ch am hu hebai haha wabsh mumku. Lazarusbad uꞌuwiga ad d Marda ch Mary.  
JHN11:2	Mary was the one who had anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair. It was her brother Lazarus who was sick.  	(Ihda Mary o wa d hegai mad wa g uhw shuhdagi an iawua Jesus tahtad an k an i dagio wabsh g e‑cheꞌechew moꞌokaj.)  
JHN11:3	So the sisters sent a message to Jesus: “Lord, your close friend is sick.”  	Kudki idam uꞌuwigaj am hema cheha mad am wo him k wo ahgi g Jesus, “S-apꞌekam t-kownalig, si m-nawoj at mumku.” 
JHN11:4	When Jesus heard the news he said, “The end result of this sickness will not be death. Through this God's glory will be revealed so that the Son of God may be glorified.” 	D am i kah g ha-ahga g Jesus k am t-ahgid, “Lazarus ash mumku. K wabshaba pi hab d ahga mat gam hu hab wo i e juh.

JHN11:5	Even though Jesus loved Martha, Mary, and Lazarus,  	Jesus ad wa ab wa chum si pihk e elid ha wui idam Marda ch Mary ch Lazarus  
JHN11:6	and had heard that Lazarus was sick, he remained where he was for two more days.  	ch wabshaba pi am hu wa hekaj i hih mo ab waid. 
JHN11:7	Then he told the disciples, “Let's return to Judea.” 	D hab kaij ab t-wui, “M att hig ep wo uhpam hihi Judea chekshani wui.” 
JHN11:8	The disciples replied, “Rabbi, just a few days ago the Jews were trying to stone you. Do you really want to go back there now?” 	Kuchd ahchim chum pi hohhoꞌid ch hab kaij ab wui, “T-mashchamdam, pi o koi d shaꞌi tash mo wa am chum s-m-maꞌichkwuimk g hemajkam. Ttp eda am ep wo hihi!” 
JHN11:9-10	“Aren't there twelve hours in a day?” Jesus replied.  “If you walk during the day you don't stumble because you can see where you're going by the light of this world. But if you walk during the night you stumble because you have no light.”  	D hab kaij g Jesus, “T am wabsh s-ap wo himad g oꞌodham tash ch ed ch wabshaba wo e huchwua s-chuhugam k ed. Pegih, pi at has wo e juh mo eda ni-apꞌechudch g Jiosh mant hab wo junihid g chikpanaj.” 
JHN11:11	After telling them this, he said, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I'm going to go there and wake him up!” 	D hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Koi at g t-nawoj Lazarus. Nt wabshaba am wo uhpam him k wo wuha.” 
JHN11:12	The disciples said, “Lord, if he's sleeping then he'll get better.” 	Kuchd hab kaij, “Kohsig o s-kehgaj wehhejed. T wo wa hejel apꞌet.” 
JHN11:13	Jesus had been referring to the death of Lazarus, but the disciples thought he meant actual sleep. 	D eda g Jesus heg hab ahg mat muh g Lazarus  
JHN11:14	So Jesus told them plainly, “Lazarus is dead.  	ch heg hekaj hab kaij, “Neh, muh at g Lazarus.  
JHN11:15	For your sake I'm glad I wasn't there, because now you will be able to trust in me. Let's go and see him.” 	Ni wabshaba wabsh s-ap ni-tahtk mani pi am hu wehmaj namt pi haha wo nei mant has wo ni-juh k ab baꞌich wo i s-ni-wohoch. Tt oi wo hihim k wo nei.” 
JHN11:16	Thomas, the Twin, said to his fellow-disciples, “Let's go too so we can die with him.” 	D ihda Thomas mam hab aꞌaga Kuadi hab kaij ab t-wui, “Pegih, ttp wo oi g t-mashchamdam k wehmaj wo t-koꞌij.” 
JHN11:17	When he arrived, Jesus learned that Lazarus had been in the tomb for four days.  	Kuchd ged hu dada Bethany t am k s-mai mash d waꞌi giꞌik tash matsh ged hu e cheh g Lazarus. 
JHN11:18-19	Bethany was just two miles from Jerusalem,  and many Jews had come to console Mary and Martha at the loss of their brother.  	Tki eda muꞌijj am dada g hemajkam ab Jerusalem t amjed mat am wo i ha gewkemhu g Marda ch Mary no pi d waꞌi gohk mihya.

JHN11:21	Martha said to Jesus, “Lord, if you'd been here, my brother wouldn't have died.  	D hab kaij g Marda ab wui g Jesus, “Neh, ni-kownalig, mapt hems s-hohtam wo jiwia, t chum pi wo muh g t-wehnag.

JHN11:23	Jesus told her, “Your brother will rise again.” 	D hab kaij g Jesus, “T wo uhpam e chegito g em-wehnag.” 
JHN11:24	“I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day,” Martha answered. 	Kud hab ep kaij g Marda, “S-mahch ani mat uhpam wo e chegito mat hekid wo i huhug g jewed.” 
JHN11:25-26	Jesus said, “I am the resurrection and the life. Those who trust in me will live, even though they die.  All who live in me and trust in me will never die. Do you believe this?” 	D hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Ia ani haꞌichug ahni mant wo i ha wuwhas g koꞌi ab amjed g muhkig k ab wo i ha mah g doakag.

JHN11:27	“Yes, Lord,” she replied, “I believe you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one expected to come to this world.” 	Kud hab kaij g Marda, “Heuꞌu, ni-kownalig, s-wohochud ani map d Jiosh si Kehsha ch d Jiosh alidag. An o oꞌohadag Jiosh oꞌohana ed maptsh ia wo jiwia jewed dahm.” 
JHN11:28	When she had said this, she went and told her sister Mary in private, “The Teacher's here, and asking to see you.” 	Kud gam hu hahawa uhpam hih g Marda k atsh am wabsh s-aꞌagi wai g Mary ash hab kaijch mo ab him g ha mashchamdam ch ab waid. 
JHN11:29-30	As soon as she heard, Mary quickly got up and went to see him.  Jesus hadn't arrived in the village yet. He was still at the place where Martha had met him.  	D am ha hekaj s-hohtam hih g Mary k ged hu jiwia mat am t-nam g Marda natt ge koi ai g kihhim.  
JHN11:31	The Jews who had been comforting Mary in the home saw how she'd got up quickly and left. So they followed her, thinking she was going to the tomb to weep there.  	Kud muꞌijj i oi g Mary hegam moki am ha wehm shoani ash hab em-ahgch mat gam hu uhpam ep wo hih hihaꞌini wui mat am wo shoakad. 
JHN11:32	When Mary arrived at the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, “Lord, if you'd been here, my brother wouldn't have died.” 	D am i cheh g Mary g Jesus k ab i gei wecho k hab kaij, “Ni-kownalig, mapt hems s-hohtam wo jiwia, t chum pi wo muh g t-wehnag.” 
JHN11:33	When Jesus saw her crying, and the Jews who had come with her crying as well, he was very troubled and upset.  	D am i nei g Jesus mo shoak g Mary. D hegam ep shoani mo wehmaj. D ged hu si ai g ihbdaj. D si has e tahtk

JHN11:36	“See how much he loved him,” the Jews said. 	D heg hekaj hab kaij g hemajkam, “Neh, kuki ab si pihk e elid wui.” 
JHN11:37	But some of them said, “If he could open the eyes of a blind man, couldn't he have kept Lazarus from dying?” 	D wabshaba haꞌijj hab ep kaij, “Neh, t wa g pi neadam doaj. T haschu ahgk pi doaj g Lazarus mat pi wo muh?” 
JHN11:38	Very troubled, Jesus went to the tomb. It was a cave with a large stone placed at the entrance. 	D am ep si has i e taht g Jesus k am i miabi g hihaꞌini. Id o ab cheho ch ed hab chuꞌig ch g hodaikaj ab kuhpi.  
JHN11:39	“Remove the stone,” Jesus told them. 	D hab ha ahg g Jesus mat gam hu wo i nuꞌichkwua g hodai. 
JHN11:40	“Didn't I tell you that if you trusted me you would see God's glory?” Jesus replied. 	D hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Napt pi chegito mani wa m-ahgid mapt wo nei g s-hasig haꞌichu k wo taht g Jiosh gewkdag maptp ab wo s-ni-wohoch.” 
JHN11:41	So they removed the stone. Jesus looked heavenwards, and said, “Father, thank you for listening to me.  	D gam hu hab i e nuꞌichkwua g hodai. D am e dahm i nea g Jesus k hab kaij, “Ni-ohg, ab ani i m-hoꞌigeꞌelid map ab ni-kaiham.

JHN11:45	Consequently many of the Jews who had come to comfort Mary and who saw what Jesus did put their trust in him.  	Muꞌijj hegam mad am i ha chehgio g Marda ch Mary ad ab i s‑wohoch mo g Jesus d Jiosh si Kehsha am i neidok mad haschu hab juh.

JHN11:47	Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the ruling council. “What shall we do?” they asked. “This man is doing many miracles.  	Kutsh am e nam g Palasi ch uꞌugchu papal ha wehm g geꞌe e jehnigiddam k am aꞌaga mas has wo juh ihda s‑hasig haꞌichu hab wuadam.  
JHN11:48	If we allow him to continue, everybody will believe in him, and then the Romans will destroy both the Temple and our status as a nation.” 	“Wehsijj at ab wo i s‑wohoch mo d Jiosh si Kehsha mattp am wabsh wo neidad.

JHN11:51	He didn't say this on his own behalf, but as chief priest that year he was prophesying that Jesus would die for the nation.  	Neh, bad kaij ch eda pi mahch mo g Jiosh am tashogid heg hekaj neꞌokij mo e aihim mat g Jesus wo e muhkid ha wehhejed g Tutuligo

JHN11:53	From that time on they plotted how they might kill Jesus.  	Neh, iaꞌi amjed ad g hahaꞌichu am i e nako mat wo mua g Jesus.  
JHN11:54	So Jesus did not travel openly among the Jews but went to a town called Ephraim in the region near the desert and stayed there with his disciples.

JHN11:55	It was nearly time for the Jewish Passover, and many people went from the countryside to Jerusalem to purify themselves for the Passover.  	Kud eda e aihim mat wo e wuhshad g t‑shohshon ha‑doꞌibiadag. K muꞌijj am hihim gam hu aꞌaijed Jerusalem kihhim wui mat am wo i e nako heg wehhejed.  
JHN11:56	People were looking for Jesus and talking about him as they stood in the Temple. “What do you think?” they asked each other. “Isn't he coming to the festival?”  	D chum hedai an chum neid g Jesus am i e hemapadk geꞌe cheopi t am ch hab kaij ab aꞌai e wui, “Pi atp hems ia hu wo shaꞌi jiwia.

JHN11:57	The chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where Jesus was should report it so they could arrest him. 	Kuki eda g uꞌugchu papal ch Palasi am i ha chehani g hemajkam mat hemho wa wo ha ahgi sha s‑mahchk mo hebai haꞌichug g Jesus. T an wo bei. 
JHN12:1	Six days before the Passover Jesus went to Bethany, to the home of Lazarus who had been raised from the dead.  	Chuhdp tash o wa am wiꞌis mat wo e ai g t‑shohshon ha‑doꞌibiadag wuhshda.  
JHN12:2	There a dinner was arranged in his honor. Martha helped serve the food while Lazarus sat at the table with Jesus and the others guests.  	Kud wa am hab e juh g geꞌe gegosig Bethany t am wehhejed g Jesus. Kuchd gam hu hihim k am ha wehm t‑gegosid. D g Lazarus am ep t‑wehmaj. Marda ad am ha wehmaj hegam mad am hihidod ch an t‑toꞌid.  
JHN12:3	Mary brought a pint of pure nard perfume and anointed Jesus' feet, wiping them dry with her hair. The scent of the perfume filled the whole house. 	D g Mary ged hu jiwia Jesus wui k g si s‑namkig uhw shuhdagi uꞌa ch an iawua Jesus tahtad an. K eda d hemako s‑wehch. D an i dagio wabsh g e‑cheꞌechew moꞌokaj. D wehsko uhwa ihda uhw shuhdagi am kih ch ed. 
JHN12:4	But one of the disciples, Judas Iscariot, who would later betray Jesus, asked,  	D hab kaij hegai t‑wehm kehshaj g Jesus mo hab chehgig Judas Iscariot,  
JHN12:5	“Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth three hundred denarii.” 	“T haschu ahgk pi e gagda ihda uhw shuhdagi matt wo ha mah g shoꞌigkam, natt pi ahim g waik siant pihsh namkigdag ab wo i nei g lial heg amjed.”  
JHN12:6	He wasn't saying this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief. He was the one who looked after the disciples' money and he often took some for himself. 	D eda pi woho s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌid g shoꞌigkam ch wabshaba s‑behimk g lial nadki pi s‑chu ehsk ch chum nuhkud g t‑lialiga ch wabsh hejel hekaj. 
JHN12:7	“Don't criticize her,” Jesus replied. “She did this in preparation for the day of my burial.  	D hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Dagitoni. T‑himdag oidk at hab juh g ni‑muhkig wehhejed.  
JHN12:8	You'll always have the poor here with you, but you won't always have me here.” 	Chum o hekid ia em‑shahgid g shoꞌigkam. Nt wabshaba ahni hi pi wabsh chum hekid ia wo em‑shahgidk.” 
JHN12:9	A large crowd had found out that he was there. They came there not just to see Jesus but because they wanted to see Lazarus, the man Jesus had raised from the dead.  	D eda wehsko kaidag mad g Jesus ab i wuhshad g Lazarus muhkig amjed. Kud muꞌi am dada g Judea t am hemajkam s‑ha neidamk.  
JHN12:10-11	So the chief priests planned to kill Lazarus as well,  since it was because of him that many Jews were no longer following them but putting their trust in Jesus. 	Kud muꞌijj ab i s‑wohoch mo g Jesus d Jiosh si Kehsha k am i ha dagito g e‑wanimeddam am i neidok g Lazarus. D am i s‑mai g uꞌugchu papal k am i e nako mat g Lazarus hab waꞌap wo mua. 
JHN12:12	The following day the crowds of people who had come for the Passover festival heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem.  	D am baꞌich i mahsi. Kuchd am i t‑nakog k gam hu hihi Jerusalem wui. D eda muꞌi am e hemapadch g hemajkam kihhim ch ed mat wo wuhshad g t‑shohshon ha‑doꞌibiadag. Chd am hihim wohg ch ed. D muꞌijj ga hu t‑nam am i kaiok mat am wo jiwia g Jesus.  
JHN12:13	They cut off palm branches and went to welcome him, shouting, “Hosanna! Blessed is the one coming in the name of the Lord. Blessed is the king of Israel.” 	Idam ad ha uhꞌukch g chukud shosha uꞌus iꞌibhonig ch ab si has elid g Jesus si s‑kaidam hab kaijch, “Id o d s‑apꞌekam t‑kownalig ch ia jiwia am wehhejed g Jiosh.

JHN12:14	Jesus found a young donkey and rode on it, as Scripture says:  	D g Jesus am hema ha tai g wechij wuhlu k heg cheshadk. 
JHN12:15	“Don't be afraid, daughter of Zion. Look, your king is coming, riding a donkey's colt.”  	Heki o hu an hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed matsh id hab wo e juh ch hab chuꞌig: 
JHN12:16	At the time, Jesus' disciples did not understand what these things meant. It was only later when he was glorified that they realized what had happened had been prophesied and applied to him. 	Kuchd pi shaꞌi amichud wehs ihda. Kut wa wabshaba hekid ab uhgk i e bei g Jesus dahm kahchim wui, tt am hahawa i chegito mo an oꞌohanas ihda Jiosh oꞌohana ed. Kutki heg hekaj hab e juh am wehhejed. 
JHN12:17-18	Many in the crowd had seen Jesus call Lazarus from the tomb and raise him from the dead and were telling the story.  That was the reason so many people went to meet Jesus—because they had heard about this miracle. 	Idam muꞌi hemajkam ad wa am nam g Jesus nash pi kah mat ab i wuhshad g Lazarus muhkig amjed. Hegam mo wa am neid ash am ha ahgid.  
JHN12:19	The Pharisees said to one other, “Look, we're getting nowhere. Everyone's running after him.” 	D hab kaij g Palasi ab aꞌai e wui am i ha neidok, “Ha g wo neid matki wehsijj am i oi. Pi attki wo t‑nako matt wo keshwua.” 
JHN12:20	Now some Greeks had come to the festival to worship.  	D am haꞌi dada g Greek hemajkam Jerusalem t am mat ab wo has el g Jiosh heg eda doꞌibiadag wuhshda piast.  
JHN12:21	They came to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, and said, “Sir, we'd like to see Jesus.”  	Kuchd am oiopo. D idam am dada k am cheh g Philip k am ahgi mo s‑neidamk g Jesus.  
JHN12:22	Philip went and told Andrew. Then they both went to Jesus and told him. 	D g Philip am ahgi g Andrew. (Idam ad am d chum kihkam Bethsaida t am am Galilee chekshani ch ed.) Kud am hahawa e wehm hihim k am ahgi g Jesus. 
JHN12:23	Jesus replied, “The time has come for the Son of man to be glorified.  	D hab kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Idani at e ai g ni‑tashga mat g ni‑ohg wo ni‑maskogi mani d si Kehshaj.  
JHN12:24	I tell you the truth: unless a grain of wheat is planted in the soil and dies  it remains just one grain. But if it dies, it produces many more grains of wheat.

JHN12:27	Now I am troubled. What should I say? ‘Father, save me from this coming time of suffering? ’ No, for this is why I came—to go through this time of suffering.  	D hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Ni‑ihbdag at ab si i e kudu.

JHN12:28	Father, show the glory of your character.” 	Pegih, ni‑ohg, am g maskogid g e‑gewkdag am gahi ni‑wuhshanim.” 
JHN12:29	The crowd that was standing there heard it. Some said it thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him. 	Muꞌi o wa am gegok g hemajkam ch kah hegai mo ab neok. Haꞌijj o hab kaij, “Ab o kaidaghim g tataniki.” 
JHN12:30	Jesus told them, “This voice spoke not for my sake, but for yours.  	D Wabshaba hab kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Ahpim at em‑wehhejed ab s‑kaidam neo, ch pi ahni ni‑wehhejed.

JHN12:34	The crowd responded, “The Law tells us that the Messiah will live forever, so how can you say the Son of man must be ‘lifted up’? Who is this ‘Son of man’?” 	D hab kaij g hemajkam, “An o hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed mat g Jiosh si Kehsha pi hekid wo muh.

JHN12:35	Jesus replied, “The light is here with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light so that the darkness doesn't overtake you. Those who walk in the dark don't know where they're going.  	D hab kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Ia ant heꞌes i tash wo haꞌichugk em‑shahgid ch heg wa wepo mani d tonlig em‑wehhejed.

JHN12:36	Put your trust in the light while you still have it so that you can become children of light.” When Jesus had told them this, he left and hid himself from them. 	Ab g wo i s‑ni‑wohochud mani eda ia wabsh kia haꞌichug k hab masma tonlig ch ed wo hihimad.” Neh, bad kaij ch gam hu hahawa i e mehkod ab ha amjed.

JHN13:1	It was the day before the Passover festival, and Jesus knew that the time had come to leave this world and go to his Father. He had loved those in the world who were his own, and he now demonstrated his complete and utter love for them.  	D am him k am i e ai matt baꞌich tash wo mua g kahwal mad k wo wuhshad g t‑shohshon ha‑doꞌibiadag. Kuki s‑mahch g Jesus mat am wa e ai matki ia wo dagito ihda jewed k wo hih am e‑ohg wui.

JHN13:2	It was during supper, and the devil had already put the thought of betraying Jesus into the mind of Judas, son of Simon Iscariot.  	D am e apꞌech matt am wo t‑gegos hema kih am gam hu i juhk. D wa eda heki hu ab i kaiha g Judas Iscariot g ge Jiawul k am i e shelch mat wo gagda g Jesus.

JHN13:4	So Jesus stood up from eating supper, took off his robe and wrapped a towel around his waist.  	ch wabshaba am i kekiwua k am wuahawua g e‑lihwa k g tuayakaj ab e bahshodad

JHN13:7	Jesus replied, “You won't realize what I'm doing for you now. But one day you'll understand.” 	D hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Pi ap hi wa amichud hemuch mani haschu chum em‑tashogid id hekaj ch wabshaba wo wa amich imhab i baꞌich.” 
JHN13:8	“No!” Peter protested. “You'll never wash my feet!” 	Kud hab hahawa kaij g Peter, “Pi apt hekid wo shaꞌi wapko g ni‑tahtad.”

JHN13:10-11	Jesus responded, “Those who have had a bath only need to wash their feet and then they're clean all over. You are clean—but not all of you.”  For he knew who was going to betray him. That's why he said, “Not all of you are clean.” 	D hab kaij g Jesus, “Heki apt hu e wako wehsko koi jiwiak. Heg at waꞌi e‑tahtad wo wapko hegai mat hedai heki hu wehsko e wako mat koi am hu wo jiwia kih t am.

JHN13:12	After Jesus had washed their feet, he put his robe back on, and sat down. “Do you understand what I've done to you?” he asked them.  	T am i ha wapko g ha‑tahtad k ab uhpam wah g e‑lihwa k ga hu hahawa ep dahiwua mihsa wui k ab ha kakke, “Nam s‑amichud mant haschu ahgk hab em‑juni ihda?

JHN13:18	I'm not talking about all of you—I know those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill Scripture: ‘The one who shares my food has turned against me.’  	“Mt wabshaba pi wehsijj ab hu wo bei ihda no pi an hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed mamt hema ab ni‑wui wo kekiwua ahpim mam ni‑wehm e gegosid.

JHN13:25	So he leaned over to Jesus and asked, “Lord, who is it?” 	Kunid wabsh s‑aꞌagi ab epai kakke g Jesus mas hedai hab ahg.

JHN13:27	After dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, son of Simon Iscariot. Once Judas had taken the bread, Satan entered him. “What you're going to do, do it quickly,” Jesus told him. 	D am wabsh i chum huh g e‑bih. D g ge Jiawul am baꞌich i chikp eda. 
JHN13:28	No one at the table understood what Jesus meant by this.  	Kuchd pi shaꞌi amichud mas haschu hab ahg ch hab kaij ihda.  
JHN13:29	Since Judas was in charge of the money some of them thought that Jesus was telling him to go and buy what was needed for the Passover festival, or to donate something to the poor.

JHN13:36	Simon Peter asked him, “Where are you going, Lord?” Jesus answered, “You can't follow me now where I'm going. You will follow me later.” 	D hab kaij g Simon Peter, “A pt hebai wo hih, ni‑kownalig?” 
JHN13:37	“Lord, why can't I follow you now?” Peter asked. “I'll lay down my life for you.” 	D hab kaij g Peter, “Nt haschu ahgk pi wo ni‑nako mant wo m‑oi hemuch? Ni‑nahtokch ani mant wo m‑wehhejed muh.” 
JHN13:38	“Are you really ready to die for me? I tell you the truth: before the cock crows you will deny me three times,” Jesus replied. 	D hab kaij g Jesus, “Ab ant wo si shel m‑ahgi map pi woho e nahtokch mapt wo muh ni‑wehhejed. Neh, waikko apt hab wo waꞌi chei map pi shaꞌi ni‑mahch mat koi wo kuhu g keli chuchul.”

JHN14:9	Jesus replied, “Have I been with you such a long time, Philip, and yet you still don't know me? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father. How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’?  	D hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Tash ani ia em‑wehmaj. Kupki eda pi woho ap ni‑mahch, ahpi Philip. Hegai mo hedai i ni‑neid ch hab masma ep neid g ni‑ohg. P haschu ahgch ab ni‑tahni mant wo em‑chehgi g ni‑ohg?

JHN14:11	Believe me when I tell you that I live in the Father, and the Father lives in me, or at least believe because of the evidence provided by all that I've done.

Kunt ab ha wui wo si pihk ni‑elidad g ni‑ohg wehm ch ab ha wui wo i ni‑tashogi.” 
JHN14:22	Judas (not Iscariot) responded, “Lord, why would you reveal yourself to us and not to the world?” 	D hab kaij g Judas, hi wa pi hegai Judas Iscariot, “T‑kownalig, pt has masma ahchim waꞌi t‑wui wo i e tashogid k pi ab hu wehs hemajkam ha wui?” 
JHN14:23	Jesus replied, “Those who love me will do as I say. My Father will love them, and we will come and make our home with them.  	D hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Hegai mo hedai ab si ni‑tatchua at wo wohog el g haꞌichu ni‑ahga. Kut hahawa ab wui wo si pihk e elidad g ni‑ohg. Kutt g ni‑ohg wehm am haha wo i t‑maskogi wui k am wo wehmajkad.

JHN14:25	I'm explaining this to you while I'm still here with you.  	“Id ani hi wa em‑ahgid hemuch mani ia em‑wehmaj.  
JHN14:26	But when the Father sends the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, in my place, he will teach you everything and remind you of all that I told you.

JHN14:27	Peace I leave you; my peace I'm giving you. The peace I give you is nothing like what the world gives. Don't let your minds be anxious, and don't be afraid. 	“Am g wabsh wo i s‑ap e tahtkkad. Ab ant wo i em‑mah hegai hab mahs s‑ap tahhadkam mani ahni edgid. Pi at hedai wo e nako mat hab mahs s‑ap tahhadkam wo em‑mah. Pi g wo shaꞌi e kudutad ch pi haꞌichu wo ehbidad. 
JHN14:28	You've heard me tell you, ‘I am going away, but I will come back to you.’ If you really loved me, you would be happy because I'm going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I.  	“Am am wa ni‑kah mani wa hab kaij mant gam hu wo hih ab em‑amjed k wabshaba ia wo wa ep em‑wehmajk.

JHN14:30	I can't talk to you much longer, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no power to control me,  	“Hemu at am geꞌe wo chehgi g e‑gewkdag g jijawul ha‑geꞌejig no pi chum e kownalchud ia jewed dahm.

JHN15:3	You are already pruned and made clean  through what I've told you.  	“Heki am hu kegchudas ahpim mam ab kaiham ch ab s‑wohog elid g haꞌichu ni‑ahga.  
JHN15:4	Remain in me, and I will remain in you. Just as a branch cannot produce fruit unless it remains part of the vine, so it is for you: you cannot bear fruit unless you remain in me.  	Pi g gam hu hab wo shaꞌi i e juhni ab ni‑amjed. Nt ahni hab wa masma pi gam hu hab wo i ni‑juh ab em‑amjed. Mt hab s‑ap hab wo juh haꞌichu k s‑ap hab wo masmak hab masma mo hegai iꞌibhonig mat s‑ap ab wo bahidagt ab giꞌikch e‑waꞌug ab. 
JHN15:5	I'm the vine, you're the branches. Those who remain in me, and I in them, will produce much fruit—for apart from me you can't do anything.  	“Pi at ab hu wo bahidagt g iꞌibhonig pi ab hu giꞌikch e‑waꞌug ab. Mt ahpim hab waꞌap pi wo e nako mamt haꞌichu s‑kehg hab wo juh mamt gam hu hab wo i e juh ab ni‑amjed.  
JHN15:6	Anyone who doesn't remain in me is like a branch that is thrown out and dries up. Such branches are gathered together, thrown into the fire and burned.  	Hegai iꞌibhonig mat wo e hikkumia at am wo i e hemapad k wo e mei.

JHN15:9-10	As the Father loved me, so I have loved you. Remain in my love.  If you do what I say, you will remain in my love, just as I do what my Father says and remain in his love.  	“Bani masma si em‑tatchua ch si pihk em‑elid mo hab masma si ni‑tatchua g ni‑ohg. Ab ani si s‑wohog elid g ni‑ohg. Ch ab aꞌai si pihk t‑elid. Kumt ahpim hab waꞌap ab wo s‑ni‑wohog elidad. Tt ab aꞌai wo si pihk t‑elidad.

JHN15:14	You're my friends if you do what I tell you.  	Ahpim am d ni‑naipijju mamtp hab wo junihid g ni‑chehanig.  
JHN15:15	I don't call you servants any longer, for servants are not taken into their master's confidence. I call you friends, for everything my Father told me I've explained to you.  	Kuni hahawa pi hab em‑aꞌaga mam d wabsh ni‑pionag ch wabshaba hab em‑aꞌaga mam d ni‑naipijju nani pi ab em‑ahgid wehs haꞌichu mani ab kah ni‑ohg amjed.

JHN15:17	This is my command to you: love one another. 	Pegih, id ani ab em‑chehani mamt ab aꞌai wo pihk e elidad.” 
JHN15:18	If the world hates you, remember that it hated me before it hated you.  	D hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Mt wo s‑chegitok mo ahni wehpeg s‑ni‑kehꞌid hegam mo pi ab hu tatchua g Jiosh ch hab waꞌap wo s‑em‑kehꞌidad.  
JHN15:19	If you were part of this world, it would love you as its own. But you're not part of the world, and I chose you out of the world—that's why the world hates you. 	Ab at wo em‑tatchua mamtp hems pi ab hu wo tatchua g Jiosh. Nt wabshaba ab si em‑gawulkai ab ha amjed. Kum pi ha wepo chegito haꞌichu. K hekaj hab s‑em‑kehꞌid.  
JHN15:20-21	Remember what I told you: servants aren't more important than their master. If they persecuted me, they will persecute you too. If they did what I told them, they will do what you tell them too.  But everything they do to you will be because of me, for they don't know the One who sent me.  	Mt wo s‑chegitok mani wa hab em‑ahgid mat pi hebai g pion hab wo chum e elidad mas baꞌich d i ge haꞌichu mo g e‑ahmo. T wo em‑shoꞌigch hegam mo ni‑shoꞌigchud.

JHN15:22-24	If I hadn't come and spoken to them, they wouldn't be guilty of sin—but now they have no excuse for their sin.  Anyone who hates me hates my Father as well.  If I had not given them such a demonstration through things that no one had ever done before, they wouldn't be guilty of sin, but despite seeing all this they hated both me and my Father.  	Ia ant jiwia ha wui k am ha ahgi ab amjed g ni‑ohg k am ha chehgi g s‑hasig chikpan mat pi hedai hekid hab juh. K wabshaba s‑ni‑kehꞌid. K heg hekaj tasho mo s‑kehꞌid g ni‑ohg. Kut hab masma mahsko wua g pi ap e‑chuꞌijig.

JHN15:26	But I will send you the Comforter from the Father. When he comes, he will give evidence about me. He is the Spirit of truth who comes from the Father.  	“Ab ant wo cheha g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag mat am wo em‑wehmajk. Heg o am wehmaj g Jiosh ch ab em‑wui wo him k wo em‑wehmajkad ch am wo i em‑gewkemhunad ch am wo haꞌichu em‑tashogidad ab ni‑amjed.  
JHN15:27	You will also give evidence about me because you were with me from the beginning. 	Kumt ahpim wo i ahgahi ab ni‑amjed nam pi ni‑wehmajkahim ga hu i amjed mant am i shonwuich g ni‑chikpan.” 
JHN16:1	I've told you this so you won't give up your trust in me.  	D hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Am ani em‑ahgid ihda mamt heg hekaj pi wo ni‑dagito.  
JHN16:2	They will expel you from the synagogues—in fact the time is coming when those who kill you will think they are doing God a service.  	T wo i em‑wuwhas ab amjed g cheopi. K ab him g tash mamt wo em‑muꞌa k hab wo e ahgad mat wehhejed hab juh g Jiosh.  
JHN16:3	They'll do this because they have never known the Father or me. I've told you this so that when these things happen, you'll remember what I told you.  	Id amt hab wo em‑juh heg hekaj mo pi ni‑mahch ch ep pi mahch g ni‑ohg.  
JHN16:4	I didn't need to tell you this right at the beginning because I was going to be with you.  	Mt wabshaba wo s‑chegitok mani id am em‑ahgid mat hekid hab wo i e juh.” 
JHN16:5	But now I'm going to the One who sent me, and yet not one of you is asking me, ‘Where are you going?’  	K wabshaba hemu e aihim mant uhpam wo hih am ni‑ohg wui. M eda pi ab hu shaꞌi s‑ni‑kakkeimk manis hebai wo hih  
JHN16:6	Of course, now that I've told you, you're full of grief. 	ch wabsh pi ap e tahtk s‑mahchok mant gam hu wo hih.  
JHN16:7	But I'm telling you the truth: it's better for you that I go away, for if I don't the Comforter won't come to you. If I go away, I will send him to you.  	T eda pi ab hu wo i hih g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag em‑wui nt hoꞌip gam hu hih. K heg hekaj baꞌich i s‑apꞌe mant gm hu wo hih.  
JHN16:8	When he comes, he will convince those in the world that they have wrong ideas regarding sin, what's right, and judgment:  	T ab haha wo i hih g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag k am wo i ha tashogi g hemajkam g s‑apꞌekam ch pi apꞌekam ch Jiosh lodaita.  
JHN16:9-10	Sin, for they don't trust in me.  What is right, for I'm going to the Father and you won't see me any longer.  	Ni‑ohg at ab wo ni‑haꞌichuch mant am wui wo him k pi ia hu wo haꞌichugk.

JHN16:12	There's much more I want to explain to you, but you couldn't stand it now.  	“Muꞌi ani haꞌichu ep s‑em‑ahgidamk. Mt wabshaba pi wo e nako mamt wo s‑amich mant wo chum em‑ahgi hemuch.  
JHN16:13-14	However, when the Spirit of truth comes, he will teach you the whole truth. He doesn't speak for himself, but he only says what he hears, and he will tell you what's going to happen.  He brings me glory for he teaches you whatever he receives from me.  	Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag at am wo i em‑tashogi g wohokam k am ep wo i em‑ahgi mat haschu has wo e juh imhab em‑baꞌich.

JHN16:16	In a little while you won't see me anymore, but then a little while after that you will see me.” 	D hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Do shaꞌi haꞌas, mt pi an hu wo ni‑neidad, ch am ep wo shaꞌi haꞌas, mt hahawa ep wo ni‑neidad.” 
JHN16:17	Some of his disciples said to one another, “What does he mean, ‘In a little while you won't see me, but a little while after that you will see me’? and ‘For I'm going to the Father’?”  	Kuchd hab kaij ab aꞌai t‑wui, “Shahchu o hab ahg ch hab kaij mas wo shaꞌi haꞌas, tt pi an hu wo neidad, ch am ep wo shaꞌi haꞌas, tt ep wo neidad. K wa hab ep kaij mat wo hih am e‑ohg wui.  
JHN16:18	They were asking, “What does he mean by ‘in a little while’? We don't know what he's talking about.” 	Pi ach shaꞌi amichud mo haschu hab ahg ch hab kaij.” 
JHN16:19	Jesus realized that they wanted to ask him about this. So he asked them, “Are you wondering about my comment, ‘In a little while you won't see me, but a little while after that you will see me’?  	D s‑mahch g Jesus machd ab s‑kakkeimk ch hekaj hab kaij, “Pi am shaꞌi amichud mani haschu hab ahg ch hab kaij mat wo shaꞌi haꞌas, mt pi wo ni‑neidad, ch am ep wo shaꞌi haꞌas, mt ep wo ni‑neidad.  
JHN16:20	I tell you the truth, you will weep and mourn, but the world will rejoice. You will grieve, but your grief will turn into joy.  	Pegih, nt wo haꞌichu em‑ahgi mat woho hab wo e juh.

JHN16:23	When that time comes you won't need to ask me for anything. I tell you the truth, the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name.  	“Mt hahawa pi ab hu wo ge ni‑kaiamad haꞌichu ch wabshaba ab wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahunad ch ab wo kakke g ni‑ohg am ni‑chehchegch. T wa woho wo em‑mah.

JHN16:25	I've been talking to you using picture language. But soon I won't use such picture language any more when I speak to you. Instead I'll explain the Father to you very plainly. 	D hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Am ani haꞌichu i chum em‑tashogid g haꞌichu wepogida ahgakaj. Ab o him g tash mant hahawa si tasho wo em‑ahgi ab amjed g ni‑ohg.  
JHN16:26	At that time you will ask in my name. I'm not saying to you that I will plead with the Father on your behalf,  	T ab haha wo em‑abk mamt ab wo i e hoꞌigeꞌidahunad ni‑ohg wui am ni‑chehchegch. Pi amt heg wo waꞌi hiwgad manis ahni am wo waꞌi ni‑hoꞌigeꞌidahunad em‑wehhejed.

JHN16:28	I left the Father and came into the world; now I leave the world and return to my Father.” 	Ia ant woho jiwia ab amjed g ni‑ohg id dahm jewed. T e ai mant uhpam ep wo hih am ni‑ohg wui.” 
JHN16:29	Then the disciples said, “Now you're talking very plainly and not using picture language.  	Kuchd ab wui hab kaij, “Nehꞌe, hemuch ap si tasho am ahg haꞌichu ch pi hekaj g wepogida haꞌichu ahga.  
JHN16:30	Now we're certain that you know everything, and that in order to know what questions people are thinking you don't need to ask them. This convinces us that you came from God.” 	Ch hahawa s‑mahch map wehs haꞌichu s‑mahch. Pi o hab hahawa mahs machs hedai ab wo ge haꞌichu m‑kakke. Ch hekaj hahawa s‑wohochud map ab amjed g Jiosh.” 
JHN16:31	“Are you really convinced now?” Jesus asked.  	D hab kaij g Jesus, “Nam hig hab elid mam id woho s‑wohochud?  
JHN16:32	“The time is coming—in fact it's just about to happen—when you will be scattered, each of you to your own homes, leaving me all alone. But I'm not really alone, for the Father is with me.  	Ab o e aihim mamt gam hu aꞌai wo si e gantad k gam hu uhpam wo hihi e‑kihki wui ia hejel ni‑dagitok. Ni wabshaba pi hejelig. Ni‑ohg o chum hekid ni‑wehmaj. 
JHN16:33	I've told you all this so that you may have peace because you are one with me. You will suffer in this world, but be brave—I have defeated the world!” 	“Wehs ani em‑ahgid ihda mamt heg hekaj wo si s‑ap e tahtkkad. T wo em‑shoꞌigch hegam mo pi ab hu tatchua g Jiosh.

JHN17:1	When Jesus finished saying this he looked up to heaven and said, “Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you.  	D am i kuhgi g Jesus g haꞌichu e‑ahga k am i nea dahm kahchim wui k am e hoꞌigeꞌidahun k hab kaij, “Ni‑ohg, ia at i e ai g ni‑tashga.

JHN17:6	I have revealed your character to those you gave me out of the world. They belonged to you; you gave them to me; and they have done what you said.  	“Ab apt ni‑wui i ha gawulkai idam chechoj mo ia ni‑wehmaj. K d m‑hemajkamga.

JHN17:7	Now they know that everything you have given me comes from you.  	k hahawa s‑mahch mo wehs g ni‑mahchig ab d m‑amjedkam.

JHN18:1	After Jesus had finished speaking, he and his disciples crossed over the Kidron brook and went into an olive grove.  	D am i haꞌasa e hoꞌigeꞌidahu g Jesus. Kuchd gam hu aigo i chehchsh hegai aki mo hab e aꞌaga Kidron k am dada mo am eshas g uꞌus.  
JHN18:2-3	Judas the betrayer knew the place, for Jesus had often gone there with his disciples.  So Judas took with him a troop of soldiers together with guards from the chief priests and the Pharisees. They arrived there carrying torches, lanterns, and weapons. 	D eda pi an hu t‑wehmaj g Judas nadki pi gam hu him k am si gagda g Jesus ha wui g uꞌugchu papal ch Palasi. Kudki idam ab muꞌi ha cheha g shondal ch cheopi nuhkuddam mat am wo oi g Judas.

JHN18:4	Jesus knew everything that was going to happen to him. He went to meet them, and asked, “Who are you looking for?” 	D eda wa chum wehs s‑mahch g Jesus mat haschu has wo e juh am tahgio ch wabshaba am i hih ha wui k hab kaij, “Dohm in gahg?” 
JHN18:5	“Are you Jesus of Nazareth?” they asked. 	D hab kaij idam, “Hegai Jesus mo ab Nazareth t ab d kihkam.” 
JHN18:6	When Jesus said “I am,” they fell back and dropped to the ground. 	D haha wabsh e totods hegam k ab taꞌi si i gegokiwua k wabsh i shul. 
JHN18:7	So he asked them again, “Who are you looking for?” 	D ab ep ha kakke g Jesus, “A m hedai in gahg?” 
JHN18:8	“I already told you I am,” Jesus replied. “So if I'm the one you're looking for, let these others go.”  	D hab kaij g Jesus, “Am ani wa heki hu em‑ahgid mani d ahni. Mtp ahni in wo ni‑gahghid ch pi has wo ha juh idam.”  
JHN18:9	These words fulfilled what he had previously said: “I have not lost any of those you gave me.” 	Neh, bo kaij no pi s‑t‑doꞌibiamk. Kud hab masma hab e juh g neꞌokij mo wa hab kaij matt wehsijj wo t‑doꞌibia. 
JHN18:10	Then Simon Peter drew a sword and struck Malchus, the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. 	D g Simon Peter ge is‑pahyo ch ab i huhpan k ab hu wabsh si i widut k higshp an si hikuch g s‑apkojed nahkaj hegai mo d uhgchu pahl neholiga ch hab chehgig Malcus. 
JHN18:11	Jesus told Peter, “Put the sword away! Do you think I shouldn't drink the cup the Father has given me?” 	D hab kaij g Jesus ab Peter wui, “Ga g hu uhpam hab juhni g e‑is‑pahyo. Pi apt wo e nako mapt wo ha shohbi nant pi hemho wa wo nako mo haschu g ni‑ohg apꞌechudch am ni‑wehhejed.” 
JHN18:12	Then the soldiers, their commander, and the Jewish guards arrested Jesus and tied his hands.  	D ab ha cheha g shondal g ha‑geꞌejig mat am wo i ha wehmt g cheopi nuhkuddam. D am bei g Jesus k gan hu si wulsh g nohnhoij k gam hu i wanim Jerusalem wui.

JHN18:15	Simon Peter followed Jesus, and another disciple did so too. This disciple was well-known to the high priest, and so he entered the high priest's courtyard with Jesus.  	Kuchd gohkajj g Simon Peter wehm am i ha oi mo am bebhehim g Jesus. K eda g uhgchu pahl s‑ni‑mahch. Nid hekaj am i wah kolhai ch ed.  
JHN18:16	Peter had to remain outside by the door. So the other disciple who was known to the high priest went and spoke to the servant girl watching the door and brought Peter inside.  	D g Peter ga hu waꞌi kehk jeg ed ab kihjeg t ab. Nid am hahawa him k ab ahgid hegai chehia mad ab nuhkud g kihjeg mat ab wo i wahki g Peter. 
JHN18:17	The girl asked Peter, “Aren't you one of that man's disciples?” 	D hab kaij ihda chehia ab wui g Peter, “Nap hig pi ahpi an ep wehmaj hegai mamt an bei?” 
JHN18:18	It was cold, and the servants and guards were standing by a fire they had made, warming themselves. Peter went and stood with them, warming himself. 	D eda s‑hehpid. D hekaj am ge nahdch g pion ch cheopi nuhkuddam ch am gegok ch e huhkalid. D g Peter am him k am ha wehm i kekiwua k e huhkal. 
JHN18:19	Then the chief priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and what he had been teaching.  	D g uhgchu pahl ab kakke g Jesus mas haschu ahgk ab haꞌi i ha gawulkad k haschu ha mashcham. 
JHN18:20-21	“I've spoken openly to everyone,” Jesus replied. “I always taught in the synagogues and in the Temple where all the Jewish people meet. I haven't said anything in secret.  So why are you questioning me? Ask the people who heard me what I told them. They know what I said.” 	D hab kaij g Jesus, “P haschu ahgch ahni ab ni‑kakke?

JHN18:22	When he said this, one of the guards standing nearby slapped Jesus, saying, “Is that any way to speak to the high priest?” 	D hab wabsh chum chei. D ab si shonikka g cheopi nuhkuddam k hab ahg, “Pi apt hab shaꞌi kaidam wo neokad ab uhgchu pahl wui.” 
JHN18:23	Jesus replied, “If I said something wrong, tell everyone what was wrong with it. But if what I said was right, why did you hit me?” 	D hab hahawa kaij g Jesus, “Am g hig wehs wo ha ahgi manis haꞌichu pi ap hab kaij. Wohokam ani em‑ahgid. Pt haschu ahgk ab ni‑shonikka?” 
JHN18:24	Annas sent him, his hands still tied, to Caiaphas the high priest. 	D g Annas am hahawa ha cheha mat am wo uꞌapa Caiaphas wui. Kud an wabsh kia wulshch g Jesus. 
JHN18:25	As Simon Peter stood warming himself by the fire, the people there asked him, “Aren't you one of his disciples?” 	D eda g Peter am wabsh kia e huhkalid ha‑nahda wui. D hab kaij hegam mad am wehmaj, “Nap hig pi ahpi an ep wehmaj hegai mamt an bei?” 
JHN18:26	One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked Peter, “Didn't I see you in the olive grove with him?”  	D am hema kehk g neholigaj g uhgchu pahl ch d hajunij hegai mat g Peter hikuch g nahkaj ch hab kaij ab wui g Peter, “Nani pi woho m‑neid amai matt am bei ihda?” 
JHN18:27	Peter denied it again, and immediately a cock crowed. 	D hab kaij g Peter, “Ih, piaꞌa.” D edapk am i kuhu g keli chuchul. 
JHN18:28	Early in the morning they took Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. The Jewish leaders didn't enter the palace because if they did they would be ceremonially defiled, and they wanted to be able to eat the Passover meal. 	Wabsh i siꞌalim mad koi i chesh g tash, md gam hu i bei g Jesus kownal kih wui. D hab chehgig hegai Pilate.

JHN18:30	“If he wasn't a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you,” they answered. 	D hab kaij ab wui, “Pi att woho ia wo uꞌapa ahpi m‑wui hegai matt pi koi wo s‑mai mo am hab junihim g pi apꞌekam.” 
JHN18:31	“Then you take him and judge him according to your law,” Pilate told them. 	D hab kaij g Pilate, “Pegih, mt ahpim wo be k ab wo mah g s‑koꞌok namkidadag mo has i mahs g em‑himdag chehanig.” 
JHN18:32	This fulfilled what Jesus had said about how he would die. 	Id ad wa hab e juh mat hab masma wo e muhkid g Jesus mo wa hab kaij no pi g kownal hab masma ha muhkid. 
JHN18:33	Pilate went back into the governor's palace. He summoned Jesus, and asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” 	D g Pilate gam hu uhpam wah e‑kih ed k ab i wai g Jesus k hab kaij ab wui, “Neh, nap hab e elid map d ha‑kownalig g Tutuligo?” 
JHN18:34	“Did you think of this question yourself, or did others talk to you about me?” Jesus responded. 	D hab kaij g Jesus, “Nap ab ni‑kakke ihda ab hejel e amjed, aha no haꞌijj ab haꞌichu i m‑ahgid ab ni‑amjed?” 
JHN18:35	“Am I a Jew?” Pilate countered. “It was your own people and high priests who handed you over to me. What is it that you've done?” 	Kud hab kaij g Pilate, “Pi ani d shaꞌi Tuhligo manis wo s‑mahchk ihda. M‑wehm hemajkam ha wehm g e‑papalig at ia m‑uꞌapa. Pt haschu has juh?” 
JHN18:36	Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If it was of this world, my subjects would fight to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from here.” 	D hab kaij g Jesus, “Ni‑kownaltalig o pi hab chuꞌig mo g id dahm jewed kokownaltalig, Tp hems hab wo chuꞌigk, t wo ha cheggia hegam mo ab si ni‑wecho e mashcham mamt pi am hu wo i ni‑dagito hahaꞌichu ha wui.

JHN18:37	Then Pilate asked, “So you are a king, then?” 	D heg hekaj hab ep kaij g Pilate, “Kupki woho hab kaij map d kownal!” 
JHN18:38	“What is truth?” Pilate asked. 	D gam hu hab si e widu g Pilate k hab kaij, “Mas haschu d i wohokam.” 
JHN18:39	However it is customary for me to release a prisoner to you at Passover. Do you want me to release the King of the Jews?” 	K eda wehs ahid ab am hema i e dadagitod g lihso em‑wehhejed iaꞌi idani mam wushshad g e‑shohshon ha‑doꞌibiadag.

JHN19:11	“You would have no power over me unless it had been given to you from above,” Jesus answered. “Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of the greater sin.” 	D hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Jiosh at ab m‑mah hegai gewkdag. K heg hekaj si pi ap hab e wua idam Caiaphas mo m‑piꞌichud mapt pi ap wo hekaj g e‑gewkdag.” 
JHN19:12	When Pilate heard this he tried to set Jesus free, but the Jewish leaders shouted, “If you set this man free you're not Caesar's friend. Anyone who sets himself up as a king is rebelling against Caesar.” 	D am i kah g Pilate ihda k am ep i wuhsh ha wui k am chum si e nako mat wo dagito.

Kupki ahpi hab waꞌap ab wui kehk g si geꞌe kownal mapt wo sha dagito ihda.” 
JHN19:13	When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called Stone Pavement (Gabbatha in Hebrew).  	D am i kah g Pilate ihda k am hahawa i wuhshad g Jesus k heg ga hu i dahiwua usagakam daikud ed amai mach hab aꞌaga Gabbatha mo an sha uhgk i hodaitas.

JHN19:16	So he handed Jesus over to them to be crucified. 	D am hahawa i dagito g Pilate g Jesus mamt ab wo mua kots t ab. 
JHN19:17	They led Jesus away, who carried his own cross, and went out to the “Place of the Skull,” (Golgotha in Hebrew).  	D g Jesus am kushwiot g hejel e‑kots. Kuchd am dada amai mo am e kokda. Bach aꞌaga amai Golgotha mo hab d ahga Koshwak.  
JHN19:18	They crucified him there, and two others with him: one on either side, with Jesus between them. 	Kumt gam si wuahawua g wehschugaj k ab sisish kots t ab k ab uhgk i bei. D eda gohk d ep lilso. Kumd idam hab waꞌap ab ha sisish kokots t ab k gan hu aꞌaijed ha chuhcha Jesus hugid an. 
JHN19:19	Pilate had a notice made and placed on the cross which said, “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.”  	D an sisishp g tapial Jesus kots t ab. K an ab hab chuꞌig: 
JHN19:21	Then the chief priests came to Pilate and asked him, “Don't write ‘the King of the Jews,’ but ‘This man said I am the King of the Jews.’ ” 	D gam hu uhpam ep hihi g uꞌugchu papal Pilate wui am i neꞌokchulidk ihda k hab ahg, “Pi g hab masma an oꞌohan mo d t‑kownalig k wabshaba an oꞌohan mo heg hejel hab kaij mo d t‑kownalig.” 
JHN19:22	Pilate replied, “What I have written I have written.” 	D hab kaij g Pilate ab ha wui, “Mant haschu an i oꞌoha, t heg an wo oꞌohadagk.” 
JHN19:23	When the soldiers had crucified Jesus they took his clothes and divided them in four so that each soldier had his share. There was also his robe, made without seams, woven in one piece.  	D hegam shondal mad am naggia g Jesus d giꞌik ch hekaj am giꞌikpa e tahpad g Jesus wepschuga. K am hema d si s‑namkig haꞌichu eniga ch pi hebai ha shohmas.  
JHN19:24	So they said to each other, “Let's not tear it, but let's decide who will have it by rolling dice.” This fulfilled the Scripture that says, “They divided my garments among them and rolled dice for my clothing.” 	D id hab ahg g shondal ch hab kaij ab aꞌai e wui, “Pi att am hu aꞌai wo t‑wanchid ihda k am wabsh wo t‑chichwi matt hedai wo t‑gehg k heg wo bei.” Neh, bad kaij ch woho am hab e juh. Kud hab masma am e wohokamch g Jiosh oꞌohana mo an oꞌohanas hab masma:

JHN19:26	When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple he loved standing beside her, he said to his mother, “Mother, this is your son.”  	Nid ahni am ha wehm kehk mo ni‑hekaj si pihk e elid g Jesus. Kud g Jesus an ni‑aꞌaga ch hab ahg g e‑jeꞌe, “Neh, id at d haha wo m‑madk m in kehk,”  
JHN19:27	Then he said to the disciple, “This is your mother.” From then on the disciple took her into his home. 	ch hab ep ni‑ahg, “Id at d haha wo m‑jeꞌek.” Neh, nid am i amjed bei g jeꞌej. Kud heg am t‑wehm kih. 
JHN19:28	Jesus now realized that he had finished all that he had come to do. In fulfillment of Scripture, he said, “I'm thirsty.” 	D hahawa s‑mahch g Jesus mat wehs hab juh mat haschu hab wo chum juh mat koi wo muh ch hab kaij, “Tonom ant.”  
JHN19:29	A jar of wine vinegar was standing there, so they soaked a sponge in the vinegar, put it on a hyssop stick, and held it to his lips.  	D an hema daha g haꞌa mad am shuhdagi g pad nawait. D am hema g shondal haꞌichu wakch pad nawait ch ed k an haꞌichu k an uskon k ab uhgk i be k ab kams hab masma mo an oꞌohadag Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana ed.  
JHN19:30	After he'd had the vinegar, Jesus said, “It's finished!” Then he bowed his head and breathed his last. 	D ab i winiun k hab hahawa kaij, “Ia ant i wehs haꞌichu nahto.” Neh, bad kaij ch am hahawa jumal i moꞌowua k am i muh. 
JHN19:31	It was preparation day, and the Jewish leaders didn't want to leave the bodies on the crosses during the Sabbath day (in fact this was a special Sabbath), so they asked Pilate to break the legs, so that the bodies could be removed.  	D am e nakog g hemajkam mat wo e mihshmad nat pi g baꞌich tash d wo shahwaik ch d wo geꞌe tashk. Kutsh g hahaꞌichu ab kakke g Pilate mat wo e ohmi g ha‑kakhio hegam mad am nahngia.

JHN19:32	So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first one and then the other of those crucified with Jesus,  	D ab ha chehani g Pilate g shondal mat wo ha ohmi g ha‑kakhio. Kud hab ha juh hegam gohk mo ab hugidaj ab nahngia g Jesus.  
JHN19:33	but when they came to Jesus they saw he was already dead, so they didn't break his legs.  	D wabshaba g Jesus heki hu muh. Kud pi ohmi g kakhioj.  
JHN19:34	However one of the soldiers stuck a spear into his side, and blood mixed with water came out.  	D hema g shondal g e‑is‑pahyokaj chuꞌakad g Jesus ab hudaj ab. Kud ab ha hekaj si e iawua g ehꞌed ch shuhdagi.  
JHN19:35	The one who saw this has given this evidence, and his evidence is true. He's certain that what he says is true so you can believe it too.  	Id anid neid ch s‑mahch mat woho muh. Kuni hab masma am em‑ahgidahim mamt ahpim hab waꞌap wo s‑mahch mat woho muh.  
JHN19:36	It happened like this so Scripture would be fulfilled: “Not one of his bones will be broken,”  	Jiosh oꞌohana o hab chuꞌig: 
JHN19:37	and as another Scripture says, “They will look at the one they pierced.” 	K an ep oꞌohanas ch hab chuꞌig: 
JHN19:38	After this Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate if he could take down the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave his permission. Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but in secret because he feared the Jews. So Joseph came and took the body away.  	K hema d Joseph ch ab Arimathea t amjed ch s‑wohochud mo g Jesus d Jiosh si Kehsha ch wabshaba s‑ha gihug hegam mo pi hohhoꞌid.

JHN19:39	He was joined by Nicodemus, the man who had first visited Jesus at night. He brought with him a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about seventy-five pounds.  	D heg am ep haꞌichug Nicodemus mat wa ged hu i wehpeg chehgim g Jesus chuhug ch ed. Idam atsh s‑ap wo juh g muhki. D g Nicodemus heg hekaj uꞌa g siant s‑wehch hegai mo d s‑ap uhw haꞌichu ch d myrrh ch aloes. 
JHN19:40-42	They took Jesus' body and wrapped it in linen cloth together with the mixture of spices, in accordance with Jewish burial customs. There was a garden near where Jesus was crucified;  and in the garden was a new, unused tomb.  Since it was the Jewish day of preparation and the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus to rest there. 	S‑e ad hohtkid nad pi hudunihim. D baꞌich tash d t‑mihshmda tash. K eda an mia cheotas hodai ch ed mamt am hab juh g hihaꞌini k wabshaba koi shaꞌi hekaj. K an wehgaj eshas g uꞌus.

JHN20:1	Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been moved from the entrance.  	Domig wabsh i siꞌalim mad wabsh kia s‑chuhugam, tsh gm hu hihi hegam Mary Magdalene k am dada cheo t am. Kutsh heki hu gam hu i e nuꞌichkwua g hodai mad hekaj ab chum kuhpi.  
JHN20:2	So she ran to tell Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, “They've taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they've put him.”  	Tsh am chum neid k am hahawa uhpam meh kihhim wui k ad gd hu t‑wui mel ahni John ch Simon Peter k am t‑ahgid ch hab kaij, “Am atki i e wuhshad g t‑kownaligbad hon heg amjed hihaꞌini mat am e cheh.

JHN20:3	Then Peter and the other disciple went to the tomb.  	Kuchd g Peter wehm am ha hekaj wohp.  
JHN20:4	The two of them were running together, but the other disciple ran faster and reached the tomb first.  	Nid ahni wehpeg ged hu mel nanid pi ahni baꞌich i s‑hohtam meh mad g Peter.  
JHN20:5	He bent down, and looking in he saw the grave-clothes lying there, but he didn't go in. 	Nid am i koachsh k nei mo am wehch hegai s‑kehg ikus k wabshaba pi am hu i wah.  
JHN20:6	Then Simon Peter arrived after him and went right into the tomb. He saw the linen grave-clothes lying there,  	D am hahawa mel g Peter k am wabsh si i wah k cheh hegai ikus  
JHN20:7	and that the cloth that had been on Jesus' head wasn't with the other grave-clothes but had been folded and placed on its own. 	ch heg ehp mat hekaj e hobino g Jesus moꞌo. D id ged hu hab wabsh hejelko holiwek ch kahch.

JHN20:9	He looked around and believed it was true for up till then they hadn't understood the Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead.  	Kuchd eda pi koi s‑amichud hegai Jiosh oꞌohana mo hab chuꞌig mat hemho wa wo i wuhsh ab muhkig amjed.  
JHN20:10	Then the disciples went back to where they were staying. 	Kuchd gam hu hahawa hihi uhpam. 
JHN20:11	But Mary stayed outside the tomb crying, and as she was crying, she bent down and looked into the tomb.  	Sh am ep oimmed g Mary cheo kihjego ch shoak ch atsh am i e jumalkad k am i koachsh hihaꞌini ch ed  
JHN20:12	She saw two angels in white, one sitting at the head and the other at the foot of where Jesus' body had been lying. 	ch ash gohk ha neid g anghil. Idam ash s‑tohtam e enigadadch ch ga hu aꞌai dadha, hema ab moꞌoshko ch hema ga hu aigo  
JHN20:13	“Why are you crying?” they asked her. 	ch hab kaij, “Uwi, shahchu ap ahgch shoak?” 
JHN20:14	After she'd said this, she turned round and saw Jesus standing there, but she didn't realize it was Jesus. 	Tsh hab cheꞌiok ab sikol i kekiwua k ash neid mash ab hema kehk ch ash wabshaba pi shaꞌi mahch mo hedai wud. 
JHN20:15	“Why are you crying?” he asked her. “Who are you looking for?” 	Sh eda d Jesus ch ab kakke ch hab kaij, “Uwi shahchu ap ahgch shoak? Dohp in gahg?” 
JHN20:16	Jesus said to her, “Mary!” 	Sh hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Mary.” 
JHN20:17	“Don't hold onto me,” Jesus said to her, “for I haven't yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brothers and tell them I am ascending to my Father and your Father, my God and your God.”  	Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “Pi g am hu ni‑shohbid. Koi ant am hu hih ni‑ohg wui. Pt wabshaba am wo him k am wo ha ahgi g ni‑naipijju mant wo uhpam i ni‑nodagi heg wui mo d ni‑ohg ch ahpim d ep em‑ohg. Heg o d ni‑Jioshga ch ahpim d ep em‑Jioshga.” 
JHN20:18	So Mary Magdalene went and told the disciples, “I've seen the Lord,” and she explained to them what he had said to her. 	D wa woho am uhpam hih g Mary Magdalene k am t‑ahgi mo neid g t‑kownalig Jesus. K heg am ahgid ihda. 
JHN20:19	That evening, on the first day of the week, as the disciples were meeting together behind locked doors because they were afraid of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “May you have peace.”  	D gam hu si i juh domig hudunk. Kuchd am t‑nam hema kih am. D ga hu si yahwidag g kihkjeg nachd pi s‑ha ehbid g hahaꞌichu. 
JHN20:20	After this greeting he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were full of joy to see the Lord. 	ch ab hahawa t‑chehgid g e‑nohnhoi ch e‑huda. Kuchd si s‑hehgig ab i neidok. 
JHN20:21	“May you have peace!” Jesus told them again. “In the same way the Father sent me, so I'm sending you.”  	D hab ep kaij ab t‑wui, “Am g wabsh wo s‑ap e tahtk. Am ant i em‑chuhcha hab masma mat g ni‑ohg am i ni‑kei. Kumt hab waꞌap am wo ahgachugad g haꞌichu ahgaj.”  
JHN20:22	Saying this, he breathed on them, and told them, “Receive the Holy Spirit.  	T hab chei ihda k ab t‑dahm ihbheiwua k hab kaij, “Ab g wo i behꞌi g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag.  
JHN20:23	If you forgive anyone's sins, they are forgiven; if you hold them unforgiven, unforgiven they remain.” 	Kumt wo s‑mahch k ah mas hedai g pi ap chuꞌijigaj gm hu hab i juni g Jiosh ch hedai pi gam hu hab i juni.” Neh, bad kaij ch am hahawa i piꞌata. 
JHN20:24	One of the twelve disciples, Thomas, who was called the Twin, wasn't with them when Jesus came.  	D g Thomas pi am hu t‑wehmaj mad wa am jiwia g Jesus.  
JHN20:25	So the other disciples told him, “We've seen the Lord.” 	Kuchd am hahawa chum ahgid matt nei g t‑kownalig. 
JHN20:26	One week later the disciples were together inside the house; and Thomas was with them. The doors were closed, and Jesus came and stood among them.

D wabshaba ab i wah g Jesus k am jiwia t‑wui k hab kaij, “Am g wabsh wo si s‑ap e tahtk.”  
JHN20:27	Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here, and look at my hands. Put your hand in the wound on my side. Stop doubting and trust in me!” 	D hab hahawa kaij ab Thomas wui, “Ab g i ni‑neid k ab tahtam g ni‑nohnhoi ch ni‑huda k ab wo s‑ni‑wohochudad.” 
JHN20:28	“My Lord and my God!” Thomas responded. 	D hab hahawa chei g Thomas, “Ni‑kownalig ch ni‑Jioshga!” 
JHN20:29	“You trust in me because you've seen me,” Jesus told him. “Happy are those that haven't seen me yet still trust in me.” 	D hab ep kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Ab apt i s‑ni‑wohoch nap pi ni‑neid. Baꞌich at wo i s‑hehgigk hegam mat ab wo i s‑ni‑wohoch wa chum pi g e‑wuhpuikaj ni‑neidch.” 
JHN20:30	Jesus did many other miraculous signs while he was with his disciples that are not recorded in this book.  	Muꞌi s‑hasig haꞌichu ad hab ep juh g Jesus am t‑nena ed mant pi oꞌoha id eda oꞌohana.  
JHN20:31	But these are written down here so that you may trust that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by trusting in him as he is you will have life. 	Nt id in hi wa ha oꞌoha mamt ab amjed wo s‑wohoch mo g Jesus d Jiosh si Kehsha ch d alidaj k hab masma ab wo bei g wechij doakag. 
JHN21:1	Later Jesus appeared again to the disciples by the Sea of Galilee. This is how it happened.  	Am waꞌi hebai amjed, d am ep i e chehgi g Jesus t‑wui amai al kahchki am am Galilee jewed ch ed.  
JHN21:2	Simon Peter, Thomas the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and Zebedee's sons, and two other disciples were together. 	Am achd wa oiopo g ni‑nawoj James wehm. K g Simon Peter ch Thomas Kuadi ch Nathanael ch gohk ep g t‑wehm e mashchamdam am t‑wehmaj. 
JHN21:3	“I'm going fishing,” Simon Peter said to them. “We'll come with you,” they replied. So they left and went out in the boat, but all night they caught nothing. 	D hab kaij g Simon Peter ab t‑wui, “Ih, nt hi wo sha ha uꞌim g waptopi.” 
JHN21:4	When dawn came Jesus was standing on the shore, but the disciples didn't know it was him.  	D ab i chesh g tash. D ab hema kehk shuhdagi hugidgo. Kuchd pi shaꞌi mahch mo hedai wud. 
JHN21:5	Jesus called to them, “My friends, haven't you caught anything?” 	D hab kaij, “Wihpiop, namt pi haꞌichu shaꞌi bei?” 
JHN21:6	“Throw the net out on the right side of the boat, and you'll find some,” he told them. So they threw out the net, and they weren't able to haul it in because it had so many fish.  	D hab hahawa kaij, “An g wo daꞌichud g e‑chuagia inhab s‑apkojed g e‑wahlko k wo haꞌi ha ui.” 
JHN21:7	The disciple Jesus loved said to Peter, “It's the Lord.” When Peter heard it was the Lord, he put some clothes on since he was naked, and jumped into the sea.  	Nid hab hahawa kaij ab Peter wui, “Doki t‑kownalig Jesus!” D am i kah g Simon Peter moki d Jesus k ab wah g e‑eniga mat wuahawua k am i dah shuhdagi ch ed k am i e wachwihim k ga hu jiwia wui.  
JHN21:8	The other disciples followed in the boat, pulling the net full of fish, because they were not far from the shore, only about a hundred yards.  	Chd ahchim haꞌi ab hahawa i himch g wahlko ab chewaimedch g chuagia waptopi shuhdch nachd pi am waꞌi waik siant keishpa ab amjed mo an i hug g shuhdagi.

JHN21:10	Jesus told them, “Bring some of the fish you've just caught.”  	D hab kaij g Jesus ab t‑wui, “Ab g wo haꞌi uꞌuk g waptopi em‑uꞌi.” 
JHN21:11	Simon Peter went aboard and pulled the net full of fish ashore. There were 153 large fish, yet even so the net hadn't torn. 	Ab ad wabsh i si shuhdags g chuagia g geꞌeged waptopikaj. Kud g Simon Peter gan hu i chesh wahlko ch ed k ab i chewaim. Kud d siant hetaspo wehst‑mahm gamai waik (153). D eda pi e wantsh g chuagia. 
JHN21:12	“Come and eat some breakfast,” Jesus said to them. None of the disciples was brave enough to ask him, “Who are you?” They knew it was the Lord.  	D hab t‑ahg g Jesus, “Oi g wo i hihim k e gegosid.” 
JHN21:13	Jesus took the bread and gave it to them and the fish as well.  	D am hih g Jesus k am bei g pahn k an i t‑hainidahim k g watopi am ep be k an i ha t‑mahkhi.  
JHN21:14	This was the third time Jesus had appeared to the disciples after being raised from the dead. 	Id o d waꞌi waikkokam mad am i e chehgi g Jesus t‑wui amjed mad ab i wuhsh muhkig amjed. 
JHN21:15	After breakfast, Jesus asked Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?” 	Kuchd am i t‑nahto t‑gegosidk. D hab kaij g Jesus ab Simon Peter wui, “Simon map d Jonas alidag, nap baꞌich i si pihk e elid ni‑hekaj mo hi idam?” 
JHN21:16	“Take care of my lambs,” Jesus told him. “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” he asked for the second time. 	D hab ep kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Simon, nap woho si pihk e elid ni‑hekaj?” 
JHN21:17	“Look after my sheep,” Jesus said to him. “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” he asked a third time. 	D id d i waikko mad hab kaij g Jesus, “Simon, nap ab si ni‑tatchua?” 
JHN21:18	“I tell you the truth,” said Jesus, “when you were young, you dressed yourself and went wherever you wanted. But when you're old, you'll hold out your hands and someone will dress you and take you where you don't want to go.”  	Neh, s‑mahch ap map hejel s‑ap an has i e wua ch am hab e junihim map has i tatchua.

JHN21:19	Jesus said this to explain the kind of death by which he would glorify God. Then he said to Peter, “Follow me.” 	Kudki heg hab ahg matki has masma wo e muhkid g Peter. T hab wo s‑mai g hemajkam g Jiosh gewkdag. Kud g Jesus hab hahawa ahg g Peter mat gam hu hasko wo oi. 
JHN21:20	As Peter turned round, he saw the disciple Jesus loved following them, the one who had leaned over to Jesus during the supper and asked, “Lord, who is going to betray you?” 	D am wehmaj i hih g Peter. Nid ab i ha oi. Kud g Peter ab uhpam i nea k ni‑neid  
JHN21:21	Peter asked Jesus, “What about him, Lord?” 	k hab kaij ab Jesus wui, “Ni‑kownalig, kut haschu am hab wo e juh am tahgio ihda John.” 
JHN21:22	Jesus told him, “If I want him to remain alive here until I return, why is that your concern? You follow me!” 	D hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Neh, mantp wo tatchuidad g John mat pi wo ha muh k ab wo ai mant ep wo jiwia, k pi ab hu haꞌichu m‑him heg amjed. Am apt wabsh wo ni‑oidad.” 
JHN21:23	This is why the saying spread among the believers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus didn't say to him that he wouldn't die, just that “If I want him to remain alive here until I return, why is that your concern?” 	Kudki an i e ahgidahi am ha shahgid g Jesus wohochuddam mantsh pi wo ha muh. D eda pi hab kaij g Jesus manis pi wo ha muh ch hab kaij, “Mantp wo tatchuidad mat pi wo ha muh k ab wo ai mant ep wo jiwia, k pi ab hu haꞌichu m‑him heg amjed.” 
JHN21:24	This disciple confirms what happened and wrote all this down. We know that what he says is true.  	Ahni ani wud manid neid ch kah ch ia oꞌoha. Kuni si s‑mahch mo d wohokam. 
JHN21:25	Jesus did many other things as well, and if it all was written down, I doubt the whole world could hold all the books that would be written.	Neh, muꞌi ad haꞌichu hab ep juh g Jesus. Tp hems am wo i e oꞌohanahi wehs k wabsh wo shuhd g jewed.

JUD01:3-4	My friends, I was already looking forward to writing to you about the salvation that we share. But now I need to write urgently to you and encourage you to vigorously defend the truth about God,  given once and for all time to God's holy people.  For some people have quietly crept in among you. They were written about and condemned a long time ago, for they are wicked people who pervert God's grace, turning it into a license to immorality, while also denying our Lord and master Jesus Christ.

JUD01:12	These people spoil your fellowship meals, for they are selfish shepherds that don't have the slightest sense of shame—they only take care of themselves.

LUK01:1-4	As you know, many others have attempted to put down in writing the things that have been fulfilled  that involve us.  They based their accounts on evidence from the earliest eyewitnesses and ministers of the Word,  and so I also decided that since I have followed these things very carefully from the beginning, it would be a good idea to write out an accurate account of all that happened.  I have done this dear Theophilus so you can be certain that what you were taught is completely reliable. 	Ni-nawoj map ab si tatchua g Jiosh: 
LUK01:5	During the time when Herod was king of Judea, there was a priest called Zechariah, who came from the Abijah priestly division. He was married to Elizabeth, who was also descended from Aaron the priest.  	Amjed atsh ab i shohshonwua ihda mash eda g Herodbad am d kownal Judea chekshani ch ed am ha dahm g Tutuligo hemajkam.

LUK01:10	During the time of offering incense a large crowd of people were praying outside.  	Kush am jeg ed gegok g hemajkam ch e hoꞌigeꞌidahun.

LUK01:12	When Zechariah saw the angel, he was startled and became terrified. 	Tsh am i nei g Zacaria k si e todsid k si s-ehbeni ihda. 
LUK01:13	But the angel told him, “Don't be afraid, Zechariah. Your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call him John.  	Kush wabshaba hab kaij g anghil, “Pi g am shaꞌi e todsid, Zacaria. Jiosh at kah g m-hoꞌigeꞌidahuna. T g m-wehm kihkam wo wa hema madt. T d wo cheojk. Kupt hab wo chehch John.

LUK01:22	When eventually he came out, he wasn't able to speak to them. They realized he'd seen a vision in the Temple, for though he could make gestures, he was completely dumb.

LUK01:24-25	Some time later his wife Elizabeth became pregnant. She stayed at home for five months. “The Lord has done this for me,” she said, “now that he's taken away my disgrace in the eyes of others.” 	Kush amai i mia amjed matsh woꞌiwua g ali.

LUK01:26-27	In the sixth month of her pregnancy God sent the angel Gabriel to a young girl called Mary who lived in the town of Nazareth in Galilee.  She was engaged to a man named Joseph. 	Neh, tsh am him k am d i chuhdp mashad am i dahm matsh am woꞌiwua g Elisabed mad. Tsh g Jiosh am chea hegai anghil mash d Gabriel matsh am wo uꞌapa g haꞌichu ahgaj hema wui g chehia.

LUK01:36	And Elizabeth, your relative, even she is pregnant in her old age. The woman that people said couldn't have children is already six months pregnant.  	“Neh, s-mahch ap mat heki hu okst g m-hajuni Elisabed k pi ha mahmadt. Kut eda g Jiosh ab s-hoꞌigeꞌel.

LUK01:39-40	A little while later, Mary got herself ready and hurried up into the hills of Judea, to the town where  Zechariah's house was. She called out to Elizabeth as she went in.

LUK02:22-24	When the time of their purification according to the law of Moses was finished, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord,  as the law of the Lord states, “Every firstborn son must be dedicated to the Lord.”  There they made a sacrifice, as God's law also states, of “a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons.” 	Tsh am i e ai g tash matsh g Mary am wo e chehgi mo kegchudas mat hab masma g Mosesbad an oꞌoha g Jiosh chehanig.

LUK03:1-2	By now Tiberias had been Caesar for fifteen years. Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea. Herod was ruler of Galilee, his brother Philip was ruler of Iturea and Trachonitis, and Lysanius was ruler of Abiline.  Annas and Caiphas were the current high priests. This was the time when the word of God came to John, Zechariah's son, who was living in the desert.  	Tsh am hebai i cheka. Kush am daha ihda John mo d Zacariabad alidag am tohono jewed ch ed.

LUK03:7-8	John addressed the crowds that came to him to be baptized. “You viper's brood! Who warned you to flee from the coming judgment?” he asked.  “Demonstrate that you have truly repented. Don't try to justify yourselves by saying, ‘We're Abraham's descendants.’ Let me tell you, God can create children of Abraham from these stones.

LUK03:16	John replied and explained to everybody, “Yes, I am baptizing you in water. But the one who is coming is more important than me, and I'm not worthy to undo his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.  	Kush heg hekaj hab kaij g John, “Pi g hab wo ni‑elid manis ahni d si haꞌichu. Ab at hema wo i wuhsh ni‑oidk mat d wo si haꞌichuk.

LUK04:28	When they heard this everyone in the synagogue became furious.  	Tsh wehsijj hegam mash am haꞌichug cheopi ch ed si babgat am i kaiok ihda  
LUK04:29	They jumped to their feet and threw him out of the town. Then they dragged him to the top of the hill on which the town was built in order to throw him off the cliff.  	k atsh gam si neꞌiopa k am i chewaim g Jesus gam hu jegko.

LUK04:30	But he walked right through them and went on his way. 	Tsh wabshaba g Jesus am wabsh ha shahgid wuhshani k gam hu hih. 
LUK04:31	Jesus went down to Capernaum, a town in Galilee. On Sabbath he started teaching them.  	Tsh gam hu hahawa hih g Jesus Capernaum wui heg eda chekshani k am ha mashcha g hemajkam cheopi ch ed mo am d i ha‑mihshmda tash.  
LUK04:32	They were amazed at what he taught them for he spoke with authority. 	Kutsh wehsijj si has i el kaiok mo has masma ha mashcham no pi si s‑e mamachim neok. 
LUK04:33	In the synagogue there was a man who was possessed by a demon. He cried out,  	Sh am hema daha mo g jiawul an uꞌukch. Kush si s‑kaidam hihnk ch hab kaij,  
LUK04:34	“So, what do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: God's Holy One!” 	“Gam g hu hihm ahpi Jesus map ab Nazareth t ab d kihkam. A napt hab ahgk ia jiwia mapt wo t‑kokda. S‑mahch ani map hedai wud. Dap Jiosh si hekia s‑apꞌekam kehsha.” 
LUK04:35	Jesus interrupted him, saying. “Be quiet!” Then he ordered the demon, “Come out of him!” Throwing him to the ground right before them, the demon left the man without injuring him.  	Tsh g Jesus ab si chehmo g jiawul k hab kaij, “Pi g shahmuni k ab i wuhshani id amjed oꞌodham.” Tsh g jiawul am si wua hegai oꞌodham wehsijj ha tahgio k ab i wuhsh amjed k pi shaꞌi koꞌokam has juh. 
LUK04:36	They were all amazed and asked each other, “What is this teaching? With power and authority he orders evil spirits to leave—and they do!”  	Kutsh wehsijj ab si has i el g Jesus k hab kaij ab aꞌai e wui, “Shaꞌi si s‑gewkdag g neꞌokij.

LUK04:37	News about Jesus spread throughout the nearby region. 	Kutsh wehsko e kah ihda anai heg oidk jejewed. 
LUK04:38	Leaving the synagogue, Jesus went to Simon's house. Simon's mother-in-law was sick with a high fever and those who were there asked Jesus to help.  	Tsh amjed gam hu hih g Jesus heg kih wui mo hab chehgig Simon. Sh eda g hohnigaj jeꞌe ihda si mumku k ch s‑toni iajidch. Kumsh am ahgid g Jesus ab amjed.  
LUK04:39	Jesus went and stood over her. He told the fever to leave her—which it did. She got up right away and prepared a meal for them.  	Tsh am him k am i kekiwua heg woꞌikud hugid an k am e hoꞌigeꞌidahu. Tsh am ha hekaj apꞌet k am i wamig k ha hihidol. 
LUK04:40	When the sun set, they brought to him all who were sick, suffering from various diseases. Jesus placed his hands on them, one after the other, and he healed them.  	Tsh gam hu hud g tash. Tsh wehsijj hegam mo g ha‑naipijju kokꞌo g nahnko mahs mumkidagkaj am ha uꞌapa Jesus wui. Kut wehsijj ab i ha tahtmahim k ha dodaj.  
LUK04:41	Demons came out of many people, shouting, “You are the Son of God.” But Jesus stopped them and refused to let them speak because they knew he was the Christ. 	Tsh muꞌi ab wui i hihi hegam mo g jijawul an ha uꞌukch.

LUK04:42	Early the following morning Jesus left to find some peace and quiet. But the crowds went out looking for him, and finally found him. They tried to stop him leaving because they did not want him to go. 	Sh am hu hebai wabsh i siꞌalim, tsh g Jesus gam hu jegko i wuhsh. Tsh am i gahghi g hemajkam k am i chehg k chum pi hiwigi mat wo hih ab ha amjed.  
LUK04:43	But he told them, “I have to go to other towns to tell them the good news of the kingdom of God too, because that is what I was sent to do.”  	Kush wabshaba hab kaij ab ha wui, “Hemho wa ant am wo i ahgahi g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahga ab amjed g Jiosh kownaltalig an aꞌai kihhim ch ed hab wa ehp nat pi hab ahgk i ni‑kei g Jiosh.”  
LUK04:44	So Jesus went on traveling around, teaching the good news in the synagogues of Judea. 	Tsh wa woho am i ha mihshmdahi wehsko ha‑chechopi ed amai Galilee chekshani ch ed. 
LUK05:1	One day, as Jesus was standing beside the Sea of Galilee, people crowded around him to hear the word of God.  	Sh am hu hebai g Jesus an kehk mo an i koa hegai al kahchki mo hab chehgig Galilee Kahchki. Kutsh g hemajkam ab wabsh i shodbinidahi s‑kaimkch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.  
LUK05:2	Jesus noticed two boats lying on the shore, left there by fishermen who were washing their nets.  	Sh neid mo gohk wapalko am wupulshpi shuhdagi ch ed. Tsh g enigakam am ha dagito k ged hu ha wapkon g e‑chuchagia.  
LUK05:3	Jesus got into a boat, the one that belonged to Simon, and asked him to push it out into the water, just offshore. Then Jesus sat down in the boat and taught the people from there. 	Kutsh am i chesh g Jesus hema ha eda idam wapalko. Sh heg d Simon eniga. Sh hab ahg matsh am wo shaꞌi nuꞌichkwua shuhdagi ch ed. Tsh g Simon hab juh. Tsh ab i dahiwua g Jesus wahlko ch ed k am ha mashcha g hemajkam. 
LUK05:4	After he'd finished speaking, he told Simon, “Go out into deeper water, and let down your nets for a catch.” 	Tsh am i haꞌasa haꞌichu ha ahgid k hab ahg ihda Simon mat am wo i himch g e‑wahlko mo am s‑juhk g shuhdagi k am wo i huduni g e‑chuchagia ha wehm g e‑wehm chikpandam. 
LUK05:5	“Lord, we worked hard all night, and didn't catch anything. But if you say so, I'll let down the nets,” Simon replied. 	Sh hab kaij g Simon, “T‑mashchamdam, ge att chuhug shaꞌi si chikpan k pi haꞌichu shaꞌi bei. P wabshaba am t‑ahgid matt am ep wo i huduni g t‑chuchagia. Pegih, tt am hab wo t‑juh.”  
LUK05:6	Having done this, a large shoal of fish filled the nets full to breaking point.  	Kutsh wa woho am hihim k am i ha huhuds ge e‑chuchagia k atsh shaꞌi si muꞌi waptopi ha ui matsh chum alo e wanikumia g ha‑chuchagia. 
LUK05:7	They waved to their partners in the other boat, asking them to come over and help. The others came over and together they filled both of the boats with fish. The boats were so full that they began to sink. 	Kush am haꞌi ep chikpan hema wahlko ch ed. Kumtsh idam ab hahawa si ha wai mat am wo i ha wehmt. Tsh wa woho ab i himch g e‑wahlko k wehs ha shuhshud g waptopikaj mat chum alo wachkk g ha‑wapalko. 
LUK05:8	When Simon Peter saw what had happened, he dropped to his knees before Jesus. “Lord, please stay away from me, for I am a sinful man!” he exclaimed.  	Tsh am i nei g Simon mat haschu has i e juh k ab si i gei g e‑tohtonkaj Jesus wui k hab wabsh kaij, “Ih, dani wabsh pi apꞌekam oꞌodham. K pi hab chum mahs maps wo ni‑wehmajk ahpi s‑apꞌekam ni‑kownalig.”  
LUK05:9	For he and everybody with him were completely amazed by the catch of fish that they had landed.  	Kutsh wehsijj hegam mash wehmaj si e totods neidch mat has e juh.  
LUK05:10	James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon's partners, felt the same way. 	Haꞌi hegam wehmaj chikpandam g Peter ash d James ch John ch ash d aꞌalidaj hegai mash hab chehgig Zebedee. 
LUK05:11	So they dragged the boats onto the shore, left everything, and followed Jesus. 	Tsh am wabsh i chum ai g shuhdagi koa idam k am i ha wuwhas g wapalko k wehs haꞌichu am wabsh i dagito k gm hu i oi g Jesus. 
LUK05:12	Once when Jesus was visiting one of the towns, he met a man there who had a very bad case of leprosy. The man fell with his face to the ground and begged Jesus, “Please Lord, if you're willing, you can make me clean.” 	Sh am hu hebai g Jesus am hasko kihhim ch ed oimmed. Kush am hema g oꞌodham wehsko maꞌishch hegai mumkidag mo g chuhkugaj muhkhim. Tsh am jiwia g Jesus. Kutsh heg am i chehg k ab si kupal i gei wui k hab kaij, “Ab g si i s‑ni‑hoꞌigeꞌid k i ni‑doajid pej maptp wo tatchuad.” 
LUK05:13	Jesus reached out and touched the man. “I am willing,” he said. “Be clean!” Immediately the leprosy disappeared. 	Tsh g Jesus ab tahtam k hab kaij, “Am o wa s‑apꞌe. Doajini.” Tsh am ha hekaj i doa. 
LUK05:14	“Say nothing to anyone,” Jesus instructed him. “Go and show yourself to the priest and make the ceremonial offerings as required by the law of Moses as proof that you've been healed.” 	Tsh g Jesus ab chehani k hab kaij, “Pi g am hedai ahgid ab amjed ihda k wabshaba am ha hekaj wo hih pahl wui.

LUK05:15	Yet the news about Jesus spread more and more. Large crowds came to hear Jesus and to be healed from their diseases.  	Tsh amjed gam hu hih hegai oꞌodham. Kutsh wehsko i e ahgahi ihda matsh g Jesus hab juh. Tsh hekaj muꞌi hemajkam am wui hihi mat wo kah g haꞌichu ahgaj k wo e dodaj.  
LUK05:16	But Jesus often used to retreat to quiet places and pray. 	Tsh g Jesus am wo ha mihshmad k wo ha dodajid k amjed gam hu hejelko wo him k wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahu. 
LUK05:17	One day when Jesus was teaching, the Pharisees and religious teachers who had come from all over Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem were sitting there. The power of the Lord to heal was with him so he could heal.  	Sh am hu hebai ehp mash g Jesus am ha mashcham. Sh am haꞌi dadha g chehanig ha mashchamdam ch hegam mo si oid g chehanig ch hab e aꞌaga Palasi.

LUK05:19	But they couldn't find any way through the crowd, so they went up on the roof and made a hole in the roof tiles. Then they lowered the man down on the mat, right into the crowd in front of Jesus. 	Kush am i chum s‑wahkidamk kih ch ed matsh wo chehgi g Jesus ab si hiwigch mat wo doaj.

LUK05:20	When Jesus saw the trust they had in him, he said to the man, “Your sins are forgiven.” 	Tsh am i nei g Jesus moki ab si hiwig idam k hab kaij ab wui ihda oꞌodham, “Ni‑nawoj, ab ani s‑m‑hoꞌigeꞌid ch gam hu hab i juh g pi ap m‑chuꞌijig.” 
LUK05:21	The religious teachers and the Pharisees began to argue with that. “Who is this who's speaking blasphemies?” they asked. “Who can forgive sins? Only God can do that!” 	Kush hegam chehanig ha mashchamdam ch Palasi wabsh hejel hab e ahg, “Ih, shaꞌi si pi ap neok ihda oꞌodham hab masma e wepogidch g Jiosh. Heg at waꞌi Jiosh wo e nako mat gam hu hab wo i juh g pi ap ha‑chuꞌijig.” 
LUK05:22	Jesus knew what they were arguing about, so he asked them, “Why are you thinking to question this?  	Sh g Jesus s‑mahch mo haschu am oidahim ch hab kaij ab ha wui, “Pi g am wo shaꞌi oidahim manis pi woho edgid g gewkdag mant gam hu hab wo i juh g pi ap ha‑chuꞌijig.  
LUK05:23	What is easier? To say your sins are forgiven, or to say get up and walk?  	Bam elid mo s‑pehegim hab e kaij mat gam hu hab i e juh g pi ap chuꞌijigaj no ge hedai s‑mahch mas s‑wohom hab e juh.  
LUK05:24	However I will prove to you that the Son of man has the authority here on earth to forgive sins.” Then he said to the paralyzed man, “I tell you: Get up, pick up your mat, and go home.” 	Pegih, nt wo em‑chehgi mani woho ge gewkdag ch hab wua mani has i kaij ahni Jiosh si Kehsha.” Neh, bash kaij ch hab hahawa kaij heg wui pi himidkam, “I g wamig k am behꞌi g e‑wahkus k hihm am uhpam.” 
LUK05:25	Immediately the man stood up in front of them. He picked up the mat he'd been lying on, and went home, praising God as he went.  	Tsh am ha hekaj i wami hegai oꞌodham k am bei g e‑wahkus k gam hu uhpam hih ab si ihmch g Jiosh.  
LUK05:26	Everyone was completely astonished at what had happened, and in great awe they praised God, saying, “What we saw today was amazing!” 	Tsh g hemajkam si has i elid k ab ihm g Jiosh hab kaijch, “Shaꞌi si s‑kehg haꞌichu ach neid id tashkaj.” 
LUK05:27	Later, as Jesus was leaving the town, he saw a tax collector called Levi sitting at his tax booth. 	Sh hema d lial kowlantdam g kownal wehhejed ch hab chehgig Levi. Tsh g Jesus am cheh. Kush am daha heg eda kih mo am chikpan. 
LUK05:28	Levi stood up, left everything, and followed Jesus. 	Tsh g Levi am ha hekaj i wuhshani k am wabsh i dagito wehs haꞌichu k gam hu i oi. 
LUK05:29-30	Levi organized a large banquet at his home in Jesus' honor. Many tax collectors and others were in the crowd that sat down to eat with them. But the Pharisees and the religious teachers complained to Jesus' disciples, asking,  “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?” 	Am waꞌi mia amjed, tsh g Levi am hab juh g geꞌe gegosig am wehhejed g Jesus. Sh am haꞌi oiopo g Palasi mash idam haꞌi d chehanig ha mashchamdam. Sh eda muꞌijj hegam mash am ha wehm e gegosid d lial kowlantdam hab masma mo g Levi. 
LUK05:31	“Healthy people don't need a doctor—but sick people do,” Jesus replied.  	Sh g Jesus hab kaij ab ha wui, “Idam pi ap hemajkam o s‑e doꞌibiamk hab masma mat g kokꞌodam wo s‑e doajidam. Hegam mo hab e elid mo s‑apꞌe at pi wo tatchua g mahkai.  
LUK05:32	“I didn't come to call those who are living right to repentance—I came to call sinners.” 	Pi ant hab ahgk ia jiwia manis wo ha doꞌibia hegam mo pi e doꞌibiamk.” 
LUK05:33	“Well, John's disciples often fast and pray, and the Pharisees' disciples do so as well. But your disciples don't—they go on eating and drinking,” they told him. 	Sh haꞌi g hemajkam hab kaij ab wui g Jesus, “Neh, muꞌikko o pi e gegosid ch wabsh e hoꞌigeꞌidahun hegam mo ab wecho e mashcham g John ch hegam mo ab ha wecho e mashcham g Palasi. Kuki wabshaba ahpi g m‑wohochuddam pi hab e wua.” 
LUK05:34	“Should the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them?” Jesus asked.  	Sh hab kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Nat hig pi wo e gegos g wo ha hohntam naipijju mat eda heg am wo ha wehmajk?  
LUK05:35	“No—but the time is coming when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they can fast.” 	T am wo i e ai mat pi am hu wo ha wehmajk. T am hahawa pi wo e gegos. Pegih, bat wo wa e juh idam ni‑naipijju mant hekid pi ia hu wo ha wehmajk.” 
LUK05:36	Then he gave them an illustration: “You don't tear out a patch from new clothes to mend old clothes. Otherwise you'd ruin new clothes, and the patch from the new wouldn't match the old.  	Sh am hahawa chum ha tashogid g Jesus mat g mashchamaj pi ap wo wehnad g ha‑himdag ash hab kaij, “Pi at hedai g wechij ikuskaj wo shohsho g hekiuchij lihwa mat wo s‑e wia nat pi wo i dahiwua k baꞌich wo i wantsh g hekiuchij. T hab waꞌap pi wo apꞌet g hekiuchij nat ge wo wepo mahsk g wechij ikus.  
LUK05:37	You don't put new wine into old wineskins, because if you did the new wine would burst the wineskins. Then both wine and wineskins would be wasted.

LUK05:38	You put new wine in new wineskins.  	Neh, hemho wa at g wechij nawait am wo e toa wechij haꞌichu elidag kokstal ch ed. 
LUK05:39	And nobody after drinking old wine wants new wine, for they say, ‘the old tastes good.’ ” 	“Pi o hedai tatchua mat wo ih g wechij nawait hekid ab i jehkiok g hekiuchij nawait nat pi hab wo chei mo baꞌich i s‑ap hab kahk g hekiuchij.” 
LUK06:1	One Sabbath while Jesus was walking through grainfields, his disciples began picking some heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands, and eating them.  	Sh am hu hebai hihim idam Jesus ha mihshmda tash ed. Kush am eshas g pilkani wohg huhugid an. Sh hegam mash am wehmaj g Jesus ab ha wohni g pilkani ch i mohon g e‑nohnhoikaj ch koꞌa.

LUK06:7	The religious teachers and the Pharisees were observing Jesus closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath. They wanted to find something to accuse him of.

LUK06:8	But Jesus knew what was in their minds. He told the man with the crippled hand, “Get up, and stand here in front of everyone.” The man got up and stood there. 	Sh g Jesus s‑mahch mo haschu am chegito ch ash hab kaij heg wui mahnikokam, “Kekiwuani k ab i hihm ia hu ha baꞌich g hemajkam.” Tsh ab i kekiwua. 
LUK06:9	Then Jesus turned to them and said, “Let me ask you a question. Is it legal to do good on the Sabbath, or to do bad? To save life, or to destroy it?” 	Sh g Jesus ab hahawa ha kakke ch hab kaij, “Shahchu am ahgch hab elid mo pi hiwgidas mihshmda tash ed mamt wo i ha wehmt hegam mo e shoꞌigchud?

LUK06:10	He looked round at all of them there. Then he said to the man, “Hold out your hand.” The man did so, and his hand became like new.  	Neh, bash kaij ch an hahawa wehsijj i ha neid k hab hahawa kaij ab wui hegai oꞌodham, “Ab g si i shelin g e‑nowi.” Kutsh am wabsh i chum shelin k am waꞌi hekaj apꞌet.

LUK06:17	Jesus went back down the mountain with them, and stopped at a place where there was some flat ground. There a crowd made up of his disciples and many other people from all over Judea, Jerusalem, and the sea coast of Tyre and Sidon, had gathered to listen to him and to be cured from their diseases.

LUK06:35	No: love your enemies, do good to them, and lend without expecting to be repaid anything. Then you will receive a great reward, and you will be children of the Most High God, for he is kind to ungrateful and wicked people.  	“Neh, mt ab wo pihk e elidad ha wui g e‑obga ch am hab wo ha junidad g s‑ap haꞌichu ch wo haꞌichu ha mah mamt pi ab hu uhpam wo ge neidad.

LUK06:42	How can you say to your brother, ‘Brother, let me take out the speck that's in your eye,’ when you don't even see the plank that's in your own eye? Hypocrite! Take out the plank from your own eye first, and then you'll be able to see well enough to take out the speck from your brother's eye.

LUK06:45	Good people produce what's good from the good things they value that they have stored inside them. Bad people produce what's bad from the bad things they have stored inside them. What fills people's minds spills out in what they say. 	K hab waꞌap masma g oꞌodham matp wo s‑apꞌek ch s‑kehg haꞌichu hab wo wuad o wo pi apꞌek ch pi kehg haꞌichu hab wo wuad.

LUK07:2-3	A centurion lived there who had a servant he greatly valued who was sick and was about to die.  When he heard about Jesus, the centurion sent some Jewish elders to him, asking him to come and heal his servant. 	Kush amai am hema d shondal ha‑geꞌejig ch ab d ha‑kehsha Rome t amjed ch kah ab amjed g Jesus. Sh id pionag hema muhkhim.

LUK07:5	because he loves our people and he built a synagogue for us.” 	Ab o si t‑tatchua ahchim Tutuligo ch am hema i kei g cheopi t‑wehhejed.” 
LUK07:6	Jesus went with them and as they approached the house, the centurion sent some friends to Jesus to tell him, “Lord, please don't trouble yourself by coming into my house, because I'm not worthy of that.  	Kutsh gam hu ha oi g Jesus k am i aihi g kihj hegai shondal ha‑geꞌejig.

LUK07:8	For I'm under the authority of my superior officers, and I have soldiers under my authority too. I command one to go and he goes, another to come and he comes. I command my servant to do something and he does it.” 	S‑amichud ani g m‑gewkdag no pi g ni‑geꞌejig gewkdag am ni‑dahm. Ni ahni hab waꞌap gewkdag am ha dahm g ni‑shondalig ch ni‑pionag.

The blind see, the lame walk, the lepers cured, the deaf hear, the dead raised back to life, the poor are told the good news.  	Sh hab hahawa ha ahg g Jesus, “Am g uhpam wo hihim k wo ahgi g John mam haschu i neid ch haschu i kah.

LUK08:8	Some seeds fell on good earth and after they grew they produced a harvest one hundred times more than what had been sown.” After he told them this, he called out, “If you have ears, then listen!” 	T wabshaba hegam mat an s‑ap shul moihuna ch ed an wuhshani k siant ab kait hehemako.” Sh hab hahawa ep kaij g Jesus, “Neh, am g wo i aꞌamichud ahpim mam kah ihda.” 
LUK08:9	But his disciples asked him, “What does this illustration mean?” 	Kush g Jesus chuhchai ab kakke mas has d ahga ihda wepogida ahga. 
LUK08:10	Jesus replied, “You've been given insights into the mysteries of God's kingdom, but the rest are given illustrations, so that, ‘Even though they see, they don't really see; and even though they hear, they don't really understand.’ 	Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “Nt wo em‑ahgi mo has d ahga no pi g Jiosh em‑hiwgid mamt wo s‑mai hegai mo haschu hemu am maskogid ab amjed g e‑kownaltalig. Ni wabshaba heg waꞌi ha ahgid haꞌichu wepogida ahga hegam mo pi ab hu wohochudamk. T hab pi wo amich haꞌichu ab amjed g Jiosh kownaltalig, chum as wo haꞌichu neid k wo haꞌichu kah.” 
LUK08:11	This is the meaning of the illustration: The seed is God's word.  	Kush hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Neh, nt wo em‑tashogi ihda haꞌichu wepogida ni‑ahga. Jiosh haꞌichu ahga o wepogidas mo g haꞌichu kai ch am wo e gantad hemajkam ha‑iꞌibdag ed.  
LUK08:12	The seeds that fall on the road are those who hear the message, but then the devil comes and steals away the truth from their minds so they won't trust in God and be saved.  	K eda haꞌi g ha‑iꞌibdag s‑kawpk hab masma mo g wohg. K g Jiawul am wabsh s‑pehegi ha wohppoꞌid hegai mo haschu i kah. T hab pi ab hu wo wohoch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga k pi wo e doꞌibia. 
LUK08:13	The seeds that fall on the stony ground are those who hear and welcome the message with joy but don't have any roots. They trust for a while but when difficult times come they give up.  	“K haꞌi g ha‑iꞌibdag hab sha masma mo hebai pi geꞌej g jewed ab waw t ab.

LUK08:14	The seeds that fall among thorns are those who hear the message but it's choked out by life's distractions—worries, wealth, pleasure—so they don't produce anything.  	“K haꞌi g ha‑iꞌibdag hab sha masma mo hebai s‑shaꞌig no pi e shaꞌijidch heg hekaj kudutadag ch s‑kaisdag ch s‑tahhadkam. Kut pi haꞌichu hab wo juh am Jiosh wehhejed. 
LUK08:15	The seeds sown on good earth are those who are honest and do what is right. They hear the message of truth, hold on to it, and through their perseverance produce a good harvest. 	“K haꞌi g ha‑iꞌibdag s‑moik hab masma mo g moihuna. Kut ab wo kaiha g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga k am wo si i nuhkud e‑ihbdag ed k am wo e nako mat am hab haꞌichu wo juh Jiosh wehhejed. 
LUK08:16	You don't light a lamp and then cover it with a bucket, or hide it under a bed. No, you put it on a stand, so that anyone who comes in can see the light.  	“Wohokam o wepogidas mo g lahmpa tonlig. Namt hig wo ehsto g lahmpa ab mehidk aha namt an wo dai mat hebai wo em‑tonlidch. Pegih, mt hab wa masma pi wo chum ehsto g wohokam.

LUK08:18	So pay attention how you ‘hear.’ To those who have received, more will be given; from those who don't receive, even what they think they have will be taken away!” 	“Am g wo s‑amichud mam haschu i kah. Hegam mat s‑ap wo hekaj g e‑apꞌedag at baꞌich ep wo i nei. T wabshaba hegam mat pi ap wo hekaj wabsh wo heb hu wua.”

LUK08:21	“My mother and my brothers are those who hear God's word, and do what it says,” Jesus replied. 	Sh hab ahg g Jesus, “Neh, idam mo ab ni‑kaiham ch ab s‑wohog elid g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga o heg wa wepo mo d ni‑jeꞌe ch ni‑wepnag.” 
LUK08:22	One day Jesus said to his disciples, “Let's cross over to the other side of the lake.” So they got into a boat and set off.  	Sh am hu hebai hab ha ahg g Jesus g e‑chuhchai, “Am att hu hig shuhdagi aigojed wo i chehchsh.” Tsh wa woho am dadhaiwua wahlko ch ed k am gahi i shul.

LUK08:24	They went over to Jesus and woke him up. “Master, master, we're going to drown!” they said. Jesus woke up and commanded the wind and the rough waves to stop. They stopped, and all was calm. 	Kutsh g chuhchaij am wui dada g Jesus k am wuhan k hab kaij, “T‑mashchamdam, ttki wo t‑koꞌij.” 
LUK08:25	“Where is your trust?” he asked them. Terrified and amazed, they said to each other, “So who is this? He gives commands to the winds and the water, and they obey him!” 	Sh hab hahawa kaij ab ha wui, “Ab g wabsh wo ni‑hiwgad.” 
LUK08:26	They sailed across to the Gerasene region that lies opposite Galilee.  	Tsh am hihim k gam hu dada ga hu aigojed g Galilee shuhdagi heg maibidch kihhim mash d Geresa. 
LUK08:27	When Jesus stepped out of the boat onto the shore, a demon-possessed man from the town came to meet him. For a long time he hadn't worn any clothes or lived in a house. He lived in the tombs.  	Kush am hema oimmed g cheoj jeg ed ch am chum kih heg eda kihhim. Sh wabshaba g jijawul an uꞌukch g chegitoidaj. Kush gan hu wabsh kih mash an chehchog ch an e hihashp g koꞌi. 
LUK08:28	When he saw Jesus he screamed, fell down at Jesus' feet, and asked in a loud voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Please don't torture me, I beg you!”  	Tsh id am chehg k si s‑kaidam hihnk ch ab i meh pi haꞌichu enigadadch mash hab wa chuꞌig k ab wui i gehsh k si s‑kaidam hab kaij, “Jesus, alidaj g si uhgk Jiosh, gam g hu hihm k pi koꞌokam has ni‑juhni.”  
LUK08:29	For Jesus had already commanded the evil spirit to leave the man. It had often seized him, and despite being tied down with chains and shackles, and placed under guard, he would break the chains apart and would be driven by the demon into the desert areas. 	Bash kaij nash pi g Jesus ab si ha chehani g jijawul mat ab wo i wuwha amjed. 
LUK08:30	“What is your name?” Jesus asked him. “Legion,”  he replied, for many demons had entered him.  	Sh hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Shahp chehgig?” 
LUK08:31	They begged Jesus not to order them to go into the Abyss. 	Tsh g jijawul ab si e shoꞌigch Jesus wui matsh pi am hu wo ha shul Jiawul kih ed. 
LUK08:32	There was a large herd of pigs feeding on the nearby hillside, and the demons begged him to be allowed to go into the pigs. Jesus gave them permission,  	Sh eda muꞌi an oiopo g kokji kawulk bahsho ch e gegosid. Sh idam jijawul ab si tahni g Jesus matsh am wo ha dagito. Tsh am wo i wahp ha eda idam kokji.

LUK08:35	The people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus they found the man freed from the demons. He was sitting there at Jesus' feet, wearing clothes and in his right mind; and they became scared.  	Tsh g hemajkam am himto mat wo nei mat haschu has e juh. Kush ihda oꞌodham am daha Jesus wui ch ab e enigadadch ch wabsh si s‑ap haꞌichu chegito. Kutsh wabsh wohoꞌi e totods. 
LUK08:36	Those who had seen what happened explained how the demon-possessed man had been healed.  	Kush hegam mash neid am ha ahgid mat has masma e doaj ihda oꞌodham.  
LUK08:37	Then all the people from the Gerasene region asked Jesus to leave because they were overwhelmed by fear. So he got into the boat and went back.  	Kush wehsijj idam Geresa t am hemajkam ab ahgid g Jesus mat gam hu wo hih ab ha amjed natsh pi shaꞌi si s‑ehbeni. Tsh wa woho hab e juh k an dahiwua wahlko ch ed mat gam hu wo hih.

LUK08:39	“Go back home, and tell people all that God has done for you,” Jesus told him. So he went away, telling the whole town all that Jesus had done for him. 	“Uhpam g hihm k am wo i ha ahgidahi mat haschu hab juh g Jiosh m‑wehhejed.” 
LUK08:40	A crowd of people was there to welcome Jesus when he returned, all eagerly expecting him.  	Tsh ga hu aigojed hahawa ep dada hegam Jesus. Kush muꞌi hemajkam am nenida ch si s‑ap i e taht k ab i nei. 
LUK08:41-42	One was a man called Jairus, a synagogue leader, who came and fell at Jesus' feet. He pleaded with Jesus to come to his home  because his only daughter was dying. She was about twelve years old. 	Tsh am hema jiwia g oꞌodham k hab chehgig Jairus ch wabsh d haꞌichu am cheopi ch ed. Sh id chehiaga muhkhim ch d gamai gohk aꞌahidag. Kutsh ab wecho si i gei g Jesus k ab ahgid matsh gam hu wo oi kihj wui. Tsh gam hu chum wehmaj hih g Jesus. 
LUK08:43	In the crowd was a woman who had suffered with bleeding for twelve years. She had spent all she had on doctors, but none of them had been able to help her.

LUK08:45	“Who touched me?” Jesus asked. Everybody around denied doing so. 	Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “Doht an ni‑taht.” Tsh pi hedai am hu e ah. 
LUK08:46	“Someone touched me,” Jesus replied. “I know because power went out from me.” 	Sh wabshaba hab kaij g Jesus, “Ab at hema ni‑taht. Ni s‑mahch nat pi ab i wuhsh g gewkdag ab ni‑amjed.” 
LUK08:47	When the woman realized she couldn't go unnoticed, she came forward, trembling, and fell down before him. Right in front of everybody she explained the reason why she had touched Jesus, and that she'd been cured immediately. 	Tsh am i nei hegai uwi mamt s‑mai k ab hahawa i him k si gigiwek ch ab i gei Jesus wecho amai hemajkam ha tahgio k ash am ahgid g Jesus mat haschu ahgk ab taht k has masma ha hekaj doa.

LUK08:49	While he was still speaking, someone came from the home of the synagogue leader to tell him, “Your daughter's dead. You don't need to bother the Teacher any longer.” 	Kush hab wabsh kia kaij ihda g Jesus. Tsh ab hema mel ab kihj amjed g Jairus k ash hab kaij, “Muh at g m‑chehiaga.

LUK08:51	When Jesus arrived at the house he didn't allow anyone else to go in except Peter, John, and James, and the girl's father and mother.  	Kutsh ged hu dada kihj am. Tsh hegam waꞌi ha ui g Jesus Peter ch James ch John ch hegam jehjij g chehia. Tsh am e wehm i wahp.

LUK08:53	They laughed at him, because they knew that she was dead.  	Kush wabsh has ahg hegam nash pi si s‑mahch mat muh.

LUK08:55	She came back to life, and she got up at once. Jesus told them to give her something to eat.  	Kutsh uhpam e chegito k ha hekaj i wami. Sh g Jesus am ha chehani mat wo haꞌichu mah. T wo huh.

LUK09:45	But they didn't understand what this meant. Its meaning was hidden from them so they didn't realize its implications, and they were afraid to ask him about it. 	Kush pi shaꞌi amichud mas haschu hab ahg ch wabshaba s‑ehbid mas ab wo kakke. 
LUK09:46	Then an argument started among the disciples about which of them was the greatest.  	Sh am hu hebai am e neꞌowin hegam Jesus chuhchai mas hedai d wo si haꞌichuk.

LUK10:6-7	If there's a peaceful person living there, then your peace will rest on them; if not, it will return to you.

For if the miracles you saw happen had happened in Tyre and Sidon they would have repented a long time ago, and they would be sitting in sackcloth and ashes.  That's why in the judgment it will be better for Tyre and Sidon than for you.  	“Muꞌi s‑hasig haꞌichu ant am hab juh Korasin ch Bethsaida kihhim ch ed. Kutki eda g hemajkam amai pi ab hu ni‑wohoch.

LUK11:13	So if you, even though you are evil, still know to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?” 	Mam has i masma pi apꞌe ch wabshaba s‑mahch mamt g s‑kehg haꞌichu ab wo ha mah g e‑aꞌaliga.

LUK11:14	Jesus was driving out a demon that had made a man dumb. When the demon had left, the man who was dumb spoke, and the crowds were amazed.  	Sh am hu hebai hema pi ha neok g cheoj nash pi g jiawul an uꞌukch. Kutsh g Jesus gam hu hab i juh g jiawul. Tsh am ha hekaj i neo. Tsh g hemajkam si has i el.  
LUK11:15	But some of them said, “He is driving out demons using the power of Beelzebub, the ruler of demons.”  	Sh eda haꞌi hab kaij, “Moki g jijawul ha‑geꞌejig ab mahkch g gewkdag. K heg hekaj gam hu hab i ha wua g jijawul ab ha amjed hegam mo an ha uꞌukch.”

LUK11:17	Jesus knew what they were thinking and said, “Any kingdom divided against itself will be destroyed. A family  divided against itself will fall.

Kut g e‑wehm kihkam hab waꞌap wo padch g hejel e‑kihdag mat ab aꞌai wo e cheggia.  
LUK11:18	If Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom stand? You say that I cast out demons using the power of Beelzebub.  	Pegih, t has hig masma g Jiawul pi wo padch g hejel e‑kownaltalig matp ab wo sha ni‑mah g gewkdag mant am wo i ha wuwhas g piongaj?  
LUK11:19	But if I drive out demons by the power of Beelzebub, by whose power do your own people drive them out? They themselves will condemn you as wrong! 	Neh, em‑pionag o hab waꞌap i ha wuwhasid g jijawul. Kum eda pi hab masma hab ha elid mo g Jiawul ab ha mahkch g gewkdag. Pegih, idam at wo em‑ahgi mo pi woho hegai mam hab chum elid.  
LUK11:20	However, if I am driving out demons by the power of God, then this proves God's kingdom has arrived. It's right here among you!  	Jiosh gewkdagkaj ani gam hu hab i ha wua g jijawul. K id am wohokamchud mat heki hu in i wuhsh g Jiosh kownaltalig em‑shahgid. 
LUK11:21	When a strong man who is fully armed guards his house, all he owns is safe.  	“Nat hig pi wo e nahtokch g si s‑gegoki kownal g e‑cheggiakudkaj mat wo nuhkud g e‑kih. T hab pi hedai wo wohppoꞌi g haꞌichu enigaj.  
LUK11:22	But if a stronger man comes and defeats him, taking from him all his weapons that he depended on, then he can carry off all his possessions.  	Tp wabshaba g baꞌich i s‑gegoki kownal wo cheggia k wo gewito k gam hu wo i ui hegai cheggiakudaj mo ab chum si hiwig k am wo aꞌai i tahp g haꞌichu enigaj am ha wehhejed g e‑shondalig.

LUK11:24	When an evil spirit leaves someone, it goes through the desert looking for a place to stay. When it doesn't find anywhere, it says, ‘I'll return to the house I left.’  	Kush hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Matp hems g jiawul an wo hema uꞌukch g oꞌodham ch wabsh wo dagito mat am hebai ep wo e ul. Kut hegai oꞌodham wo i chum kegch g e‑doakag. T wabshaba g jiawul pi hebai wo chehg k hekaj hab wo i e ah, ‘Mo hig woho d ni‑kih hegai oꞌodham. Nt hig am uhpam wo hih wui.’

LUK11:26	So it goes and finds seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and live there. In the end that man is worse off than before.” 	T am haha wo him k wewaꞌak ep wo ha uꞌapa g jijawul. T idam baꞌich wo i pi apꞌek ch am wehmaj wo i chiwia. Neh, t ihda oꞌodham hahawa baꞌich wo i pi apꞌek mo wa ga hu i heki hu.” 
LUK11:27	As he was speaking, a woman in the crowd called out, “Blessed is the womb from where you came and the breasts that nursed you.”  	Sh an wehgaj gegok g hemajkam. Kush hema g uwi hab kaij am wui g Jesus, “Do si geꞌe s‑hehgig heg wehhejed uwi mat an m‑mahsid k m‑siꞌichudahim.” 
LUK11:28	But Jesus said, “Even more blessed are those who hear God's word, and follow what it says.” 	Sh wabshaba hab kaij g Jesus, “Baꞌich at wo i s‑hehgigk hegam mat ab wo kaihamad g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.” 
LUK11:29	As people crowded around him, Jesus began telling them, “This is an evil generation for it's looking for some miraculous sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.  	Sh am i muꞌidahim g hemajkam. Kush hab kaij g Jesus, “Muꞌijj o g ha‑chegitoidag pi apꞌe. K heg hekaj s‑neidamk mant hab wo juh g s‑hasig haꞌichu k am wo wohokamch mani ab Jiosh amjed. Bant waꞌi masma am wo ha chehgi mani d Jiosh si Kehsha matsh wa hab e juh hegai kelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam mash d Jonah.  
LUK11:30	In the same way that Jonah was a sign to the people of Nineveh, so will the Son of man be a sign to this generation.  	Heg atsh wa am si has masma i e chehgi ha wui g Ninevah t am hemajkam. Nt ahni am si has masma wo i ni‑chehgi am ha wui g hemajkam iaꞌi idani. 
LUK11:31-32	The queen of the south will rise in the judgment together with the people of this generation and will condemn them, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear Solomon's wisdom, and now there is someone greater than Solomon here!  The people of Nineveh rise in the judgment together with this generation, and will condemn it, for they repented when they heard Jonah's message, and now there's someone greater than Jonah here!  	“Hegam Ninevah t am hemajkam atsh gam hu s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegitoi am i kahk g Jonabad k hab pi ab hu wo e chuꞌijigch geꞌe lodaita tash ch ed.

LUK11:33	No one lights a lamp and then hides it or places it under a bowl. No, you put it on a lamp stand so that those who come into the house can see the light.  	Kush hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Wohokam o wepogidas mo g lahmpa. Kum s‑mahch mo pi hab d ahga g lahmpa mas am wo e ehsto haꞌichu wecho. Mt an wo dai mat hebai wo ha tonlidad hegam mo ab i wahpk. 
LUK11:34	Your eye is the light for your body. When your eye is good, your whole body is full of light. But when your eye is bad, your body is in the dark.  	“Em‑wuhpui at s‑ap am wo i wahki g tonlig matp wo s‑mamsk k wabshaba pi am hu wo i wahki matp pi wo mamsk. Kum heg hekaj s‑ap ha nuhkud.

LUK11:36	If your whole body is full of light, with no areas of darkness, then it will be completely illuminated, just as a bright lamp gives you light.” 	Bat waꞌi masma ab wo i shuhdad g em‑chegitoidag g wohokam.” 
LUK11:37	After Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to come and eat with him. So Jesus went and sat down to a meal.  	Tsh am i haꞌasa neo g Jesus. Tsh am hema jiwia g Palasi k am waid mat wo wehmaj e gegos. Kutsh wa woho am i wahk k am i dahiwua matsh wo e gegos.

LUK11:39	So the Lord told him, “You Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside you're full of greed and wickedness.  	Kush s‑amichud g Jesus ch hab kaij ab wui, “Neh, ahpim Palasi am si kegchud g e‑honshpadag. K wabshaba g em‑chegitoi wabsh shuhdags g pi apꞌekamkaj.

LUK11:42	Shame on you Pharisees! You pay tithe on herbs and plants, but you neglect justice and the love of God. You need to pay attention to the latter, while not leaving the former things undone.  	“Neh, ahpim Palasi am ab mahk g Jiosh g hemako tahpani mo wehst‑mahm e tahpanch g em‑eniga, chum hems g nahnko mahs pi‑miandi ch haꞌichu tatk.

LUK11:46	Jesus replied, “Shame on you lawyers too! You place burdens on people that are too hard to carry, but you don't lift a finger to help them.  	Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “Pegih, ab em‑wui o hab waꞌap him g s‑koꞌok em‑namkidadag. Muꞌi s‑hasig haꞌichu am ab ha chehani g hemajkam. K id d s‑wehch haꞌichu mohtoi am ha wehhejed.

LUK11:47-48	Shame on you! You build memorial tombs to honor the prophets, but it was your own fathers who killed them in the first place!  By doing this you are witnesses showing that you agree with what your fathers did. They killed the prophets, and you build their tombs! 	“Em‑shohshon at muꞌi ha kokda g Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam. Kum ahpim ha wepo masma, chum ams ha hehosid g ha‑hihaꞌiniga hegam mamt ha kokda. K heg hekaj ab em‑wui him g s‑koꞌok em‑namkidadag.

LUK12:1	In the meantime so many thousands of people had gathered that they were stepping on each another. Jesus began speaking first to his disciples. “Beware the yeast of the Pharisees—hypocrisy.  	Kutsh shaꞌi si muꞌi mihl hemajkam am i e hemapad k wabsh aꞌai e keishshap.

LUK12:5	Let me make it clear whom you should be afraid of. You should be afraid of the one who after he has killed has the power to dispose of them in Gehenna. That's the one you should be afraid of.  	Heg at waꞌi Jiosh wo e nako mat am wo em‑daꞌich Jiawul kih ed mamtp pi am hu wo wohog elidad. Kumt heg ab wo waꞌi si has elidad.

Your life will be demanded back this very night, and then who will get everything you've stored up?’  	“K wabshaba ab wui hab kaij g Jiosh, ‘Dap wabsh tohnto. Id i s‑chuhugam ab apt wo muh.

LUK12:27	Think of the lilies and how they grow. They don't work, and they don't spin thread for clothes, but I tell you, not even Solomon in all his glory was as beautifully dressed as one of them. 	“An g wo i ha neid hegam haꞌichu wuhshanig m an chuhch.

LUK12:35-36	Be dressed and ready, and keep your lamps lit,  like servants waiting for their master when he returns from his wedding feast, prepared to open the door quickly for him when he comes and knocks.  	Kush hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Mt wo si e nahtokch mat haschu has wo e juh hab sha masma mat g pion wo si e nahtokch mat g ha‑ahmo wo uhpam jiwia.

LUK12:37	How good it will be for those servants that the master finds watching when he returns. I tell you the truth, he will get dressed, have them sit down for a meal, and will come and serve them himself! 	T wo si s‑hehgigk hegam pion mat g ha‑ahmo wo ha cheh mo nenead ch e nahtokch.

LUK12:39	But remember this: if the master knew when a thief was coming, he would keep watch, and not allow his house be broken into.  	“Neh, pi o ta machima mas hekid hema wo i jiwia g s‑chu ehskam. Kum heg hekaj chum hekid nuhkud g e‑kihdag.  
LUK12:40	You must also be ready, for the Son of man is coming when you don't expect him.” 	Pegih, k hab waꞌap pi ta machima em‑wehhejed manis hekid wo uhpam jiwia jewed wui ahni Jiosh si Kehsha. Mt heg hekaj wo si e nahtokchid chum hekid.” 
LUK12:41	“Is this story you're telling just for us, or for everyone?” Peter asked. 	Sh hab kaij g Peter, “T‑kownalig, nap ahchim waꞌi hab t‑ahg aha nap wehs hab ha ahg?” 
LUK12:42	The Lord replied, “Who then is the trustworthy and wise manager, the one person in the household that the master puts in charge to share out their food at the right time?  	Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “Chum amt hedai wo e nahtokch mamtp wo s‑wapagimak ch wo s‑chu aꞌamichudad. S‑mahch am mat g ha‑ahmo hema wo e gahgi g hab mahs chikpandam k wo nuhkudach g e‑kihdag.

LUK12:44	I tell you the truth, the master will put that servant in charge of everything.  	nat pi g ahmoj am hahawa wehs dahm wo kei g e‑kihdag. 
LUK12:45	But what if the servant were to say to himself, ‘My master is taking a long time in coming,’ and then starts beating the other servants, both men and women, feasting and getting drunk?  	“T wabshaba pi ap d wo ha‑kehshak matp hedai wo i ha shoꞌigchudad g e‑wehm pion ch wo si e gegosidad ch wo nawmmukad hab e ahgch mat pi oi wo jiwia g ahmoj.  
LUK12:46	That servant's master will return unexpectedly one day at a time he wasn't aware of, and will punish him severely, treating him as totally untrustworthy. 	T haha wabsh wo jiwia k wo cheh mo pi ap hab wua g e‑chikpan k wo si s‑koꞌokam namkid k gam hu hab wo i juh. 
LUK12:47	That servant who knew what his master wanted and yet didn't get ready or follow his instructions, will be beaten severely;  	“T wo bei g s‑koꞌok e‑namkidadag hegai pion mat wo s‑mahchk g e‑ahmo tatchui ch eda pi am hu hab wo junihid.  
LUK12:48	but the servant who didn't know and did things deserving punishment will be beaten only lightly. From those who are given much, much will be required, and from those who are entrusted with more, more will be demanded.  	T wabshaba pi am hu i si s‑koꞌokam wo bei g e‑namkidadag hegai mo pi e mahch ch hab junihim g pi apꞌekam. Baꞌich i geꞌe haꞌichu amt uhpam wo s‑behim ab amjed hegai mamt baꞌich haꞌichu nuhkudach.” 
LUK12:49	I have come to set the earth on fire, and I really wish it was already burning!  	Kush hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Ia ant jiwia jewed dahm mant wo i ha chuꞌamu g hemajkam hab sha masma mant am wo si i nai ha‑iꞌibdag ed. T hab wo s‑nenenashanik ab Jiosh wui. Mat huꞌi heki hu hab wo e juh.

T g uwi g e‑jeꞌe o g e‑mad o g e‑kahkma jeꞌe wo s‑kehꞌidad.” 
LUK12:54-56	Then Jesus spoke to the crowds. “When you see a cloud rising in the west, you immediately say, ‘a rain-shower's coming,’ and it happens.  When a south wind blows, you say ‘it's going to be hot,’ and it is.  You hypocrites, how is it that you know how to rightly interpret the weather but you don't know how to interpret the present time?  	Sh hab hahawa ep kaij g Jesus, “Neh, mt wo s‑mahchk mas wo juh o as wo tonih am neidk mas hebaijed hewed ch has mahs chewagi i wushke.

LUK12:57	Why don't you think for yourselves and judge what's right?  	“E o aihim mat g Jiosh wo ha lodai g hemajkam. Am g wo aꞌamichud mamt has wo chum masmak.  
LUK12:58	As you go with your accuser to the magistrate, on the way you should be working on a settlement. Otherwise you may be dragged before the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and the officer throw you into prison.

LUK13:1	It was around this time that some people told Jesus about Pilate's killing of some Galileans while they were offering sacrifices in the Temple.  	Kush iaꞌi idani haꞌi g oꞌodham am ahgid g Jesus matsh g kownal Pilate haꞌi ha kokda g Galilee t am hemajkam mash eda idam am hab chum wua g iagchulida Jiosh wui.

LUK13:4	What about those eighteen people that were killed when the tower in Siloam fell on them? Do you think they were the worst people in the whole of Jerusalem?  	“Neh, am atsh i gei g uhgk kih Siloam woꞌo t am Jerusalem ch ed. Kutsh gamai gigiꞌik e koꞌij.

LUK13:6	Then he told them this story as an illustration. “Once there was man who had a fig tree planted in his vineyard. He came to look for fruit on the tree, but he didn't find any.  	Sh g Jesus am ha ahgid ihda haꞌichu wepogida ahga, “Neh, matp hema g oꞌodham ge suhnaga am uhdwis e‑oidag ed ch am him k am s‑uꞌim g suhna. K pi ab hu bahidag. 
LUK13:7	So he told the gardener, ‘Look, for three years I've been coming to look for fruit on this fig tree and I haven't found any. Chop it down! Why should it be taking up space?’ 	“K hab ahg g oidag nuhkuddam, ‘Neh, waik aꞌahid ab ach am nenneid hegai suhna uhs ch pi koi haꞌichu shaꞌi bei ab amjed. Pt wo shonch.

LUK13:8	‘Master,’ the man replied, ‘please leave it alone for just one more year. I'll dig the soil around it and put down some fertilizer.  	“K wabshaba hab kaij g oidag nuhkuddam, ‘Am att hig wabsh wo dagito hemako ahidag ehp. Nt am wo si i moihun k am wo iawua g haiwani biht an wehgaj.

LUK13:10	One Sabbath Jesus was teaching in a synagogue,  	Sh am hu hebai mihshmda tash ch ed g Jesus am ha mashcham cheopi ch ed.  
LUK13:11	and a woman was there who had been crippled by an evil spirit for eighteen years. She was bent over and could not stand straight.  	Sh am hema haꞌichug g uwi mash g jiawul an uꞌukch. Kush gamai gigiꞌik aꞌahid ab waꞌi mumku mash ab wabsh i e olatch ch pi e nako mat wo shel i kekiwua.

LUK13:13	Then he placed his hands on her, and immediately she straightened up, and she praised God. 	K ab hahawa taht. Kutsh ha hekaj shel i kekiwua k ab si ihm g Jiosh. 
LUK13:14	However the synagogue leader was upset that Jesus had healed on the Sabbath. He said to the crowd, “There are six days for work. Come and be healed on those days, not on the Sabbath.” 	Kutsh ab si bagat hegai mash d ha‑wanimeddam am cheopi ch ed matsh g Jesus ha doaj ha‑mihshmda tash ed k ash hab ha ah g hemajkam, “Am o haꞌichug g chuhdp tash matt heg eda wo chikpanad.

LUK13:15	But the Lord answered him, “You hypocrites! Doesn't every one of you untie your ox or donkey from the stall and take it to drink?  	Sh hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Ih, pi ap shaꞌi woho ab hu has elid g Jiosh pi ab hu hoꞌigeꞌidch ihda uwi no pi d chum aligaj.

LUK13:20-21	He asked again, “What shall I compare the kingdom of God to?  It's like yeast that a woman took and mixed into three measures of flour which made the whole batch rise.” 	Sh hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Jiosh kownaltalig o hab waꞌap wepogidas mo g jewajidakud.

LUK13:25	Once the house owner gets up and closes the door, you'll be standing outside knocking on the door, saying, ‘Master, please open the door for us.’ But he'll reply, ‘I don't know you or where you're from.’  	Id ant wo wepogi g kih enigakam mat am wo i ha wahpki g e‑machiga k am haha wo si kuh g pualit.

LUK14:12	Then he said to the man who had invited him, “When you give a lunch or a dinner, don't invite your friends, or your brothers, or your relatives, or your rich neighbors, for they may invite you back, and then you'd be repaid.  	Sh hab hahawa ep kaij g Jesus ab wui hegai mat ab i wai, “Pi g hegam ab waꞌi ha waid e‑naipijju o g e‑wepnag o g e‑hajuni o g s‑kakais e‑hugid an kihkam mapt hekid hab wo juh g gegosig.

LUK14:23	So the master told the servant, ‘Go out on the country roads and lanes, and make people come—I want my house to be full.  	“K hab ep kaij g ahmoj, ‘Am g i wuhshani k an mehk hihm chuꞌuchum wopog oidch an shaꞌi ch ed k hab wo ha juh mat ab wo i hihi mat wo shuhd g ni‑kih.

LUK14:25	A large crowd was accompanying Jesus. He turned to them and said,  	Sh am hu hebai hihim hegam Jesus. Sh muꞌi hemajkam am ha wehm hihim. 
LUK14:26	“If you want to follow me but you don't hate your father and mother, and wife and children, and brothers and sisters—even your own life—you can't be my disciple.  	“Pi am ab hu shaꞌi ni‑tatchua mamtp pi baꞌich ab wo i ni‑tatchua mam hi g e‑jehj ch e‑wepnag ch e‑wehm kihkam ch e‑aꞌaliga.

LUK14:31	What king goes to war with another king without first sitting down with his advisors to work out whether he and his ten thousand can defeat the one marching against him with twenty thousand?  	“Neh, matp hems hema g kownal wo s‑cheggiam g e‑obga k eda al wehst‑mahm mihl (10,000) wo shondaligak.

LUK15:4	“Imagine a man who had a hundred sheep lost one of them. Wouldn't he leave the ninety-nine in the open pasture, and search for the one that's lost until he finds it?  	“Id o wepo masma mamtp hems hema ahpim siant wo kahwaligak. Kut hema wo heb hu hih.

Kumt hab wo ha ah, ‘Si g wo s‑hehgigk ni‑wehm. Cheh ant g ni‑shoiga mat chum heb hu hih.’ Kut am em‑wehm wo si s‑hehgigk.  
LUK15:7	I tell you that there's more joy in heaven over a sinner that repents than over ninety-nine good people who don't need to repent.

LUK15:8	Imagine a woman who has ten silver coins, and loses one of them. Wouldn't she light a lamp and sweep the house, carefully searching until she finds it?  	Kush id am ep ha ahgid g Jesus ch hab kaij, “Matp hema g uwi wehst‑mahm wo enigak g lial ch hema wo heb hu wua.

T am wo i e hemapai. T hab wo ha ah, ‘Si g wo s‑hehgigk ni‑wehm. Cheh ant g ni‑lialiga mant chum heb hu wua.’ Kut am wehmaj wo si s‑hehgigk.

LUK15:11	Once there was a man who had two sons,” Jesus explained.  	Sh hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Matp hems hema g oꞌodham gohk wihpiopga.  
LUK15:12	“The younger one told his father, ‘Father, give me my inheritance now.’ So the man divided his property between them.  	T g chumchu ab wui i him k hab kaij, ‘Ni‑ohg, wapt wo i ni‑mah hegai mat d wo chum ni‑wuikamk.’ Kut wa woho am i gawulkai g e‑eniga k ab ha mah g e‑wihpiopga hegai mo haschu d ha‑wuikam. 
LUK15:13	A few days later the younger son packed up what he had and left for a distant country. Here he wasted all his money living a reckless life. 	“T ihda chumchu am ha hekaj gagda g e‑eniga k bei g namkigaj k gam hu simnolt mehk jewed wui k am heki wua g e‑lialiga am hab wuadch g pi apꞌekam.

LUK15:16	He was so hungry that he would have eaten even the pig food, but no one gave him anything.  	Kut chum hems heg s‑hugim mo haschu g kokji koꞌa. T pi hedai haꞌichu mah mas wo huh. 
LUK15:17	When he came to his senses, he said to himself, ‘All of my father's workers have more than enough to eat—why am I dying from hunger here?  	“T am hahawa haꞌichu kop moꞌoj ed. K hab e ahg, Wehs g ni‑ohg pionag o s‑edgid g haꞌichu hugi. Kuni eda ahni d bihugimkam.  
LUK15:18	I'm going home to my father! I'll tell him, “Father, I've sinned against heaven and against you.  	Nt hig wo uhpam hih ni‑ohg wui k hab wo chei, ‘Ni‑ohg, pi ant ap has chuꞌi ab m‑wui ch ab Jiosh wui.

LUK15:20	So he left and went home to his father. 	“Neh, t am ha hekaj i wuhshani k am wui hih g e‑ohg. T heg cheh mo im hu wabsh kia him k ab si s‑hoꞌigeꞌid k ab wui med k gan hu kohm k ab chintad. 
LUK15:21	The son said to him, ‘Father, I've sinned against heaven and against you. I'm no longer worthy to be called your son.’ 	“K ab wui hab kaij g alidaj, ‘Ni‑ohg, pi ant ap has chuꞌi am m‑wui ch am Jiosh wui. K hahawa pi d ni‑wuikam mams hab wo ni‑aꞌagad mani d m‑alidag.’ 
LUK15:22	But the father told his servants, ‘Quick—bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.  	“T wabshaba g ohgaj hab wabsh ha ah g e‑pionag, ‘Ab g wo i bek g s‑kehg eniga k an wo wahkid k g anilo an wo shaꞌich nowij an k g shuhshk ab ep wo cheka

LUK15:26	So he called one of the servants and asked what was going on. 	Kut kah k ab hema kakke g pion mas has d ahga ihda. 
LUK15:27	‘Your brother is back,’ he replied, ‘and your father has killed the fattened calf, because he's come home safe and sound.’ 	“K heg hab kaij, ‘M‑wehnag at jiwia. Kumt mua g s‑gihg wisilo k hab juh g geꞌe gegosig nat pi s‑ap jiwia.’ 
LUK15:28	The brother became angry. He refused to go in. So his father came out to plead with him. 	“Neh, t bagat ihda geꞌechu k pi am hu i wah. T am hahawa kah g ohgaj k am i wuhshani k am wabsh s‑ap ab chum waid.  
LUK15:29	He told his father, ‘Look, all these years I've served you, and never disobeyed you, but you never once gave me even a young goat so I could have a party with my friends.  	K wabshaba ab wui hab kaij, ‘Nehꞌe, haꞌakia aꞌahidag ani ab m‑wecho ch chum hekid hab wua g m‑tatchui. Kupt eda pi hekid chum hems g siwat mad ab ni‑mah mant wo ni‑gegosid k wo s‑hehgigk am ha wehm g ni‑naipijju.

LUK15:31	‘Son,’ the father replied, ‘you are always here with me. Everything I have is yours.  	“K g ohgaj ab wui hab kaij, ‘Ni‑alidag, ahpi ap chum hekid ni‑wehmaj. K wehs hegai mo d ni‑eniga d m‑eniga.  
LUK15:32	But we should be happy and celebrate! This is your brother who was dead, but who has returned alive; he was lost but now he's found!’ ” 	K wabshaba hemu am wa s‑apꞌe matt wo si s‑hehgigk nat pi uhpam ep jiwia ihda m‑wehnag mat am simnolt. Heg o wa wepo mat muh k ep e chegito,’ bo kaij g ohgaj.” 
LUK16:1	Jesus told his disciples this story. “There was once a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting what belonged to his master.  	Sh am ep ha ahgid g Jesus ihda wepogida ahga ch hab kaij, “Tp hems am hu hebai hema d wo s‑kais oꞌodhamk. K hegai mat am i kei mo d maliom wabsh heki wua g lialigaj.  
LUK16:2	So the rich man called in his manager, and asked him, ‘What's this I hear about you? Bring in your accounts, because you won't be continuing as manager.’ 	T am i wai e wui k hab kaij, ‘Am ant haꞌichu sha naksh ab m‑amjed k antki hekaj hab wo chei mapt am wo i kuint k am wo oꞌoha wehs map has i masma nuhkud g haꞌichu ni‑eniga nantki pi wo m‑dagito.’ 
LUK16:3	The manager said to himself, ‘Now what will I do since my master is going to fire me from my job? I'm not strong enough to dig, and I'm ashamed to beg.  	“T hab i e ah ihda oꞌodham, ‘Tki wo i ni‑wuhshad g ni‑ahmo. Nis has wo ni‑juh? Pi ant wo ni‑nako manis wo waikkat k si ni‑elid manis wo haꞌichu ha tahnid.  
LUK16:4	Oh, I know what I'm going to do so that when I'm sacked as manager people will make me welcome in their homes.’ 	Neh, s‑mahch ani mantki has wo ni‑juh k muꞌi wo naipijjuk. T idam ab wo i ni‑wahki e‑kihki ed mamt hekid wo i ni‑wuhshad id amjed ni‑chikpan.’  
LUK16:5	So he invited all those who were in debt to his master to come and see him. He asked the first one, ‘How much do you owe my master?’  	Bo kaij ch am hahawa hehemako ha waid hegam mo ab ab e wulshch g ahmoj. Kut am hema jiwia. K g maliom ab wui hab kaij, ‘Nap s‑mahch map heꞌekia ab ab i e wulshch g t‑ahmo?’ 
LUK16:6	The man replied, ‘A hundred units  of oil.’ He said to him, ‘Sit down quickly. Take your bill, and change it to fifty.’  	“K hab kaij ihda, ‘Heuꞌu, hemako siant waplin g a‑saidi ani ab ab ni‑wulshch.’ 
LUK16:7	Then he said to another, ‘How much do you owe?’ The man replied, ‘A hundred units of wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill and change it to eighty.’ 	“K g maliom ab wui hab kaij, ‘Nap s‑mahch map heꞌekia ab ab i e wulshch g t‑ahmo?’ 
LUK16:8	The rich man commended his dishonest manager for his cunning idea. The children of this world are more cunning towards one another than are the children of light. 	“Neh, t g ahmoj si has i el am i kahk mat has e juh ihda s‑chu banmadamkam maliom nat pi si s‑e mahch k hab e juh. Neh, hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh o em‑baꞌich i s‑e mahch ch hab wua haꞌichu. 
LUK16:9	I tell you, use the wealth of this world to make friends for yourselves so that when it's gone, you'll be welcomed into an eternal home.  	“Id ani em‑ahgid mamt wo s‑ap hekaj g e‑kaisdag am ha wehhejed hegam mo tatchua g i wehmtadag. T g Jiosh s‑ap am wo i em‑wahpki e‑kihdag ed mamt hekid wo muh. 
LUK16:10	If you can be trusted with very little you can also be trusted with much; if you are dishonest with very little you will also be dishonest with much.  	“Hegai matp hedai s‑ap wo nuhkud g al chuꞌuchum haꞌichu at hab waꞌap s‑ap wo nuhkud g geꞌeged haꞌichu. Kutp hedai wo ha banmad g al chuꞌuchum haꞌichukaj k hab waꞌap wo ha banmad g geꞌeged haꞌichukaj.  
LUK16:11	So if you can't be trusted when it comes to worldly wealth, who will trust you with true riches?  	Am g wo s‑ap nuhkudad hegai mam haschu em‑nuhkudachud id dahm jewed. T g Jiosh am wo haꞌichu em‑nuhkudach e‑kownaltalig ed. Heg o d s‑wohom kaisdag

LUK16:13	No servant can obey two masters. Either he will hate one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You can't serve both God and Money.” 	“Pion at pi wo e nako mat gohk wo aꞌamok. Hema at baꞌich ab wo i tatchuad ch baꞌich i s‑ap wo chikpanidad. Kumt ahpim hab waꞌap pi wo shaꞌi e nako mams wepo ab wo ha tatchuad g Jiosh ch ihda jewed dahm s‑kaistalig.” 
LUK16:14	The Pharisees, who loved money, heard what Jesus said and laughed at him.  	Sh am haꞌi kah g Palasi wehs ihda. K eda g Palasi si pihk e elid g s‑kaisdagkaj. Kush idam heg hekaj nahnko ahg g Jesus. 
LUK16:15	But Jesus told them, “You appear pious to people, but God knows your hearts. What people value highly is detested by God.  	Sh hab kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Ahpim am hab chum e wua mam d s‑apꞌekam am ha tahgio g hemajkam. K wabshaba g Jiosh s‑mahch g em‑iꞌibdag. Hegai mo haschu i g hemajkam hab chum elid mo d si haꞌichu o d wabsh pi haꞌichu am Jiosh nena ed. 
LUK16:16	What was written in the law and the prophets lasted until John. From then on the good news of the kingdom of God is being spread, and everyone is forcing their way in.  	“Mosesbad ch hegam haꞌi kekelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam at an oꞌoha mamt has wo chum masmak.

LUK16:18	Any man who divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adultery, and a man who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. 	“Dat wo pi ap chuꞌijkamk hegai matp hedai wo s‑ohhod g e‑wehm kihkam k hema ep wo bei. K hab waꞌap wua g pi apꞌekam hegai matp hedai an wo bei g ha‑ohhoda.” 
LUK16:19	Once there was a man who was rich. He wore purple clothes and fine linen, and enjoyed a luxurious life.  	Sh id am ep ha ahgid g Jesus: 
LUK16:20	A beggar named Lazarus used to sit at his gate, covered in sores,  	K am hema d si shoꞌigkam oꞌodham ch hab chehgig Lazarus ch wehsko hihiwog. Kum ab i bebhe ch ab dadsha s‑kais oꞌodham kihjego.

LUK16:23	In Hades, where he was in torment, he looked up and saw Abraham in the far distance, with Lazarus beside him. 	T am i e chegito k oki am haꞌichug mo am kuhkpi g pi apꞌekam ch shaꞌi si s‑koꞌok haꞌichu tahtk ch ab i nea e dahm. K g Lazarusbad ab wehmaj daha g t‑shohshon Abraham.

LUK16:25	But Abraham replied, ‘My son, remember that you enjoyed the good things of life, while Lazarus had a very poor life. Now he is here being comforted, while you suffer in torment.  	“K wabshaba hab kaij g Abrahambad, ‘Ni‑hajuni, am g i chegito map wa in d doakam ch wehs haꞌichu s‑kehg edgid.

Kutt pi wo t‑nako machs hedai am gahi wo i chesh em‑wui o mamt ahpim ab gahi wo i chesh t‑wui.’ 
LUK16:27-28	The rich man said, ‘Then Father, I beg you, please send him to my father's house.  For I have five brothers and he can warn them so that they don't end up here in this place of torment.’ 	“K hab kaij g s‑kais oꞌodham, ‘Pegih, ni‑shohshon, am ani hetasp wepnag.

Sh hab hahawa ep kaij g Jesus ab ha wui hegam mash ab hiwig, “Chum o hekid haꞌichu hab e wua mamtp hems heg hekaj am wo i shul pi apꞌekam ch ed.

LUK23:39	One of the criminals hanging there joined in the insults against Jesus. “Aren't you the Messiah?” he asked. “Then save yourself—and us too!” 	Kush hema hegam pi ap hehemajkam mash ab hab waꞌap naggia kots t ab ab si s‑koꞌokam has ahg g Jesus ch hab kaij, “Neh, kuptp d ge Jiosh si Kehsha, pegih, k wo hejel e doꞌibia k ahchim ep wo t‑doꞌibia.”

LUK23:50-51	There was a man called Joseph who was good and honest. He was a member of the council,  but he hadn't agreed with its decisions and actions. He came from the Jewish town of Arimathea, and was waiting expectantly for the kingdom of God.  	Sh eda wa hema hegam e jehnigiddam chum pi hohhoꞌid matsh g wehmaj e jehnigiddam s‑muꞌam k ah g Jesus.

LUK24:12	However Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Bending down, he looked in and saw only the linen grave-clothes. So he went back home, wondering what had happened.

LUK24:18	One of them, called Cleopas, replied, “Are you just visiting Jerusalem? You must be the only person who doesn't know the things that have happened in the past few days.” 	Sh hema idam hab chehgig Cleopas ch id hab kaij ab wui, “Aha nap ahpi waꞌi hejel pi mahch mat haschu has e juh hemuch huꞌi ch eda am daha Jerusalem t am?”

LUK24:20	But our high priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death, and they crucified him.  	Kut g uꞌugchu papal ch t‑wanimeddam am i dagito kownal wui mat wo mua. Kumt ab sisish kots t ab k mua.

MAT01:2	Abraham was the father of Isaac; and Isaac the father of Jacob; and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers;  	Abraham atsh wa an alidt g Isaac. 
MAT01:17	So all the generations from Abraham to David add up to fourteen; from David to the Babylonian exile, fourteen; and from the Babylonian exile to the Messiah, fourteen.

MAT01:18	This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah happened. His mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, but before they slept together she became pregnant by the Holy Spirit.  	Ia ant wo oꞌoha matsh has e juh matsh eda mahsi g Jesus Christ. Am amtsh i apꞌech matsh idam Joseph ch Mary wo e hohont. Tsh am hahawa s‑e mai mat g ali wo bei.

MAT01:20	While he was thinking about all of this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and told him, “Joseph, son of David, don't be afraid to marry Mary because she is pregnant by the Holy Spirit.  	Sh am oidahim ihda g Joseph. Kutsh am haha wabsh ab wui i e chehgi g anghil am chehchkij ed k hab kaij, “Joseph map ab d Davidbad amjedkam, am g wabsh s‑ap e tahtk k wo bei g Mary mat d wo m‑wehm kihkamk.

Kunt ahni am hab waꞌap wo him k ab wo ihm mani ab has elid.” 
MAT02:9-10	After they had heard what the king had to say they went on their way, and the star which they had seen in the east led them until it stopped right above the place where the child was.  When they saw the star they couldn't contain their happiness!  	Kutsh gam hu hahawa hihim k gam hu hebai i hihim. Tsh ab ep i e mahsid hegai huꞌu mash am wa heki hu neid.

MAT02:11	They went into the house and saw the child with Mary his mother. They bowed and worshiped him. Then they opened their bags of treasure and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.  	Tsh am dada k am i wahp kih ch ed. Sh am woꞌo hegai ali. Kush g jeꞌej am wehmaj.

MAT02:13	After they'd left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, and told him, “Get up, and take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Remain there until I tell you, because Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.” 	Tsh ab hahawa i e chehgi g anghil Joseph wui am chehchkij ed k ash hab kaij, “Kownal Herod at am wo i gahghi ihda ali mat wo chum s‑muꞌam.

MAT02:16	When Herod realized he'd been fooled by the wise men, he got very angry. He sent men to kill all the young boys in Bethlehem and the regions nearby who were two years old and under. This was based on the time frame he'd discovered from the wise men.  	Pegih, tsh pi am hu ep i hihi Herod wui hegam s‑chu aꞌamichuddam mash wa am ha ahgid g Jiosh. Tsh heg hekaj bagat g Herod.

MAT02:22	But Joseph was afraid to go there after he learned that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as king of Judea.

MAT03:7-9	But when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to be baptized, he said to them, “You vipers' brood! Who warned you to run away from the coming judgment?  Show by what you do that you have truly repented, and don't presume to say proudly to yourselves, ‘Abraham is our father.’ I tell you that God could make children of Abraham from these stones.

MAT05:1	When Jesus saw the crowds following him he went up a mountain. There he sat down together with his disciples.  	Tsh am i ha nei g Jesus idam muꞌi hemajkam k ab i chesh kawulk t ab mat ab ha wui wo neo. Kutsh an wehgaj i e hemapai hegam mash ab si wecho e mashcham.  
MAT05:2	He began teaching them, saying: 	Tsh g Jesus am i ha mashcha. 
MAT05:13	You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt becomes tasteless, how can you make it salty again? It's good for nothing, so it's thrown out and trodden down.  	“Neh, s‑mahch am mat pi wo e padch g chuhkug mamtp wo si onmad. Pegih, mt hab wa masma haꞌichu wehhejed wo s‑kehgajk am ha shahgid hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh. Jiosh at gam hu hab wo i em‑juh mamtp pi haꞌichu wehhejed wo s‑kehgajk hab masma mamt hab wo juh g on matp wo kahko. 
MAT05:14	You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill can't be hidden.  	“Ahpim mam ab si ni‑hiwig amt wehs wo ha tonolidad g hemajkam. Heg o wa wepo mam d tonlig am ha wehhejed. Pi g am wo ehstokch hegai mamt haschu hab wo junidad g Jiosh. Neh, no hig pi woho mat pi ap wo e ehsto g kihhim matp am wo dahmkad g tohnk.  
MAT05:15	No one lights a lamp and then puts it under a bucket. No, it's placed on a lamp-stand and it provides light to everyone in the house.  	T g lahmpa hab waꞌap pi wo e ehsto haꞌichu wecho. Mt an wo dai mat hebai wo em‑tonolidad.  
MAT05:16	In the same way you should let your light shine before everyone so they can see the good things you do and praise your heavenly Father. 	Pegih, mt ahpim pi wo ehsto g s‑em‑apꞌekam k wabsh wo ha hiwgidad g hemajkam mat wo nei. Kut hekaj ab wo si has elidad g em‑ohg Jiosh. 
MAT05:17	Don't think I came to abolish the law or the writings of the prophets. I didn't come to abolish them, but to fulfill them.  	“Pi ant hab ahgk ia jiwia jewed dahm manis gam hu hab wabsh wo i juh hegai chehanig ch mashchamadag matsh wa g kekelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam ab bei Jiosh t amjed. Heg eda o an oꞌohanas mant has wo masmak ch has wo ni‑juh k wo nahto g ni‑chikpan.  
MAT05:18	I assure you, until heaven and earth come to an end, not a single letter, not a single dot of the law will come to an end before everything is fulfilled.  	Nt wo si shel em‑ahgi mat pi hekid gam hu hab wo i e juh g Jiosh chehanig. Wehs at s‑ap wo e nahto hegai mo an oꞌohanas mat koi wo huhug g dahm kahchim ch jewed kahchim, chum hems g si al chuꞌuchum haꞌichu.  
MAT05:19	So whoever disregards the least important commandment, and teaches people to do so, will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever practices and teaches the commandments will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.  	Kut d wabsh wo pi haꞌichuk am Jiosh nena ed hegai mat hedai pi am hu wo wohog elidad g Jiosh chehanig ch wo ha mashcha haꞌijj ehp mat hab waꞌap pi ab hu wo wohog elidad. Kut heg d wo si haꞌichuk am Jiosh nena ed mat hedai ab wo wohog elidad g Jiosh chehanig ch wo ha mashcha haꞌijj ehp mat ab wo wohog elidad.  
MAT05:20	I tell you, unless your righteousness is more than that of the religious teachers and the Pharisees, you can never enter the kingdom of heaven. 	Bo e elid g chehanig em‑mashchamdam ch Palasi mo s‑ap oid g Jiosh chehanig. Nt wabshaba wo em‑ahgi mamt hemho wa ha baꞌich i s‑ap wo oidad mamtp am s‑wahpkim Jiosh kihdag ed. 
MAT05:21	You've heard that the law said  to the people of long ago: ‘You shall not murder, and anyone who commits murder will be condemned as guilty.’  	“S‑mahch am mo hab chuꞌig g heki hu chehanig mamt pi wo ha mua g hemajkam. Kut hemho wa wo e lodai matp hedai wo sha ha mua.  
MAT05:22	But I tell you, anyone who is angry with his brother will be condemned as guilty. Whoever calls his brother an idiot has to answer to the council,  but whoever insults people is liable to the fire of judgment. 	Kunt ahni am baꞌich hab wo i ah mamt am wa hugkam ab wo moht g chuꞌijig mo g ha muꞌakam mamt chum hems wabsh wo bagat ab hema i wui k hab wo ah mo d wabsh pad haꞌichu. Ab o em‑wui him mat g Jiosh wo em‑lodai heg hekaj k gam hu wo i em‑wua Jiawul kih ed. 
MAT05:23	If you're at the altar making an offering, and remember that your brother has something against you,  	“Am g wo haꞌasa e hoꞌigeꞌidahun mamtp wo s‑chegito mamt hema i pi ap dohdda. Pi at ab hu wo em‑kaiha g Jiosh.  
MAT05:24	leave your offering on the altar and go and make peace with him first, and afterwards come back and make your offering.  	Wehpeg amt am wo i e apꞌech heg wui mamt pi ap dohdda k am haha wo e‑hoꞌigeꞌidahu.  
MAT05:25-26	While you're on the way to court with your opponent, make sure you settle things quickly. Otherwise your opponent might hand you over to the judge, and the judge will hand you over to the court official, and you will be thrown into jail.  I tell you the truth: you won't get out of there until you've paid every last penny. 	Mtp hems wo em‑lodai mamtp pi am hu s‑hohtam wo i e apꞌech. Kumt wo e kuhpach am hugkam mamt wehs wo namkid wehhejed mamt has i juh. Baꞌich at wo i s‑apꞌek mamt wehpeg hejel am wo i e apꞌech aꞌai e wui. 
MAT05:27	You've heard that the law said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’  	“S‑mahch am mo hab chuꞌig g heki hu chehanig mamt pi wo ha ehs g ha‑wehm kihkam.  
MAT05:28	But I tell you that everyone who looks lustfully at a woman has already committed adultery with her in his heart.  	Kunt ahni am baꞌich hab wo i ah mo heg wa wepo mamt ha ehs mamtp am wabsh wehmaj wo s‑woꞌiwuim hegai mo pi d em‑wehm kihkam.  
MAT05:29	If your right eye leads you to sin, then tear it out and throw it away, because it's better to lose one part of your body than to have your whole body thrown into the fire of judgment.  	Kut d wo em‑wuikamk mamt gam hu wo i e wua Jiawul kih ed. Baꞌich at wo i s‑apꞌek mamt chum hems wo heb hu wua g e‑nendag.  
MAT05:30	If your right hand leads you to sin, then cut it off and throw it away, for it's better for you to lose one of your limbs than for your whole body to go into the fire of judgment. 	Do em‑wuikam mamt am hu wo i e wua Jiawul kih ed chum ams haschu pi apꞌekam hab wo juh. K baꞌich i s‑apꞌe mamt chum hems wo heb hu wua g e‑nowi. 
MAT05:31	The law also said, ‘If a man divorces his wife, he should give her a certificate of divorce.’  	“S‑mahch am mo hab chuꞌig g heki hu chehanig mamt hemho wa am wo i wuhshad g ohhoda tapial e‑hohnig wehhejed mamtp wo s‑ohhod.  
MAT05:32	But I tell you that any man who divorces his wife except for sexual immorality causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. 	Nt wabshaba am wo em‑ahgi mat d wo pi apꞌekamk mamt wo s‑ohhod, heg hi wa mamt wo s‑mai am i chum hohntk mat heki hu ha wehm woꞌiwua. Kut d wo pi apꞌekamk mat g em‑ohhoda hema ep wo kunt. Id at d wo em‑chuꞌijigk mamtp wo s‑ohhod. Kut hegai mat wo hohnt hab waꞌap wo juh g pi apꞌekam. 
MAT05:33	And again, you've heard that the law said to the people of long ago, ‘You shall not perjure yourself. Instead make sure you keep the oaths you swear to the Lord.’  	“S‑mahch am mo hab chuꞌig g heki hu chehanig mamt pi wo ha iattogidad ch hemho am hab wo wa juh mam haschu ha ahgid ch chehcheg g Jiosh.  
MAT05:34	But I tell you, don't swear at all. Don't swear by heaven, because it's the throne of God.  	Nt wabshaba am wo em‑ahgi mamt hemho am hab wo wa juh g e‑neꞌoki. Pi o apꞌe mams wabsh chum haschu wehhejed wo gewkaj g e‑neꞌoki. Neh, am am wabsh pehegia gewkaj g e‑neꞌoki am chehchegch g dahm kahchim. K eda g dahm kahchim d Jiosh kihdag. K hab wa masma mamtp hems g Jiosh am chehch.  
MAT05:35	Don't swear by the earth, because it's God's footstool. Don't swear by Jerusalem, because it's the city of the great King.  	Kum am ep chehcheg g jewed. K eda heg d Jiosh nahtoi ch heg wa wepo mo d keishpakudaj. Kum am ep chehcheg g Jerusalem. K eda heg d kihhimaj g Jiosh.

T eda g Jiosh wo waꞌi e nako mat wo em‑mohtoꞌi g chuꞌijig. Id o wehs hab masma mamtp hems am chehch g Jiosh.  
MAT05:37	Simply say yes or no—more than this comes from the Evil One. 	Neh, bamt wo chum juh g e‑neꞌoki, chum ams pi wo gewkaj am chehchegch g Jiosh. T d wabsh wo ge Jiawul amjedkamk mamtp wo ha iattogi. 
MAT05:38	You've heard that the law said, ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’  	“S‑mahch am mo hab chuꞌig g heki hu chehanig mamt wo ha lodai mat hedai s‑koꞌokam has em‑juh. T ab wui hab epai wo e juh mat has i em‑juh.  
MAT05:39	But I tell you, don't resist someone who is evil. If someone slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other cheek to them as well.  	Nt wabshaba am wo em‑ahgi mamt pi wo shaꞌi e agwuim. Tp hems hema ab wo em‑shonihi em‑kahm ab. Pegih, mt wabsh wo hiwigi mat ab ep wo em‑shonihi.

MAT05:41	If someone demands that you go one mile, go with them two .  	Kumt gam hu wo si baꞌiwich mam haschu chikpan em‑mohtoꞌid wabsh s‑ap e tahtkch.  
MAT05:42	Give to those who ask you, and don't turn away those who want to borrow from you.  	Pi g wo shaꞌi daꞌid matp haschu i tatchua g shoꞌigkam. 
MAT05:43	You've heard that the law said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’  	“S‑mahch am mo e ahgachug mamt ab wo si ha tatchuad g e‑naipijju ch wo s‑ha kehꞌidad g e‑obga.  
MAT05:44-47	But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,  so you may become children of your heavenly Father. For his sun shines on both the good and the bad; and he makes the rain fall on both those who do right and those who do wrong.  For if you only love those who love you, what reward do you have? Don't even the tax-collectors do that?  If you only speak kindly to your family, what more are you doing than anyone else? Even the heathen  do that!  	Nt wabshaba am wo em‑ahgi mamt pi hegam waꞌi ab wo si ha tatchuad e‑naipijju. Chum o hems g pi ap hemajkam ab si ha tatchua g e‑naipijju ch wabshaba pi heg hekaj wo e doꞌibia.

Kumt ahpim hab wo chum masmak mo g Jiosh nam pi d aꞌaligaj.  
MAT05:48	Grow up and become completely trustworthy, just as your heavenly Father is trustworthy. 	Em‑ohg Jiosh o d si hekia s‑apꞌekam. Pegih, mt ahpim hab waꞌap d wo si hekia s‑apꞌekamk.” 
MAT06:1	Make sure not to do your good deeds in front of people, just so they can be seen. Otherwise you won't have any reward from your Father in heaven.  	Kush hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Am g wo s‑e nenꞌoidad mamt pi am hu hab wabsh wo wuad g haꞌichu s‑apꞌekam hab ahgk mat g hemajkam wo neidad mam haschu am hab junihim. Jiosh at pi ab hu wo em‑mah g s‑kehg mahkigdag mamtp hab masma wabsh wo s‑e chehgidam. 
MAT06:2	When you give to the poor, don't be like the hypocrites who blow their own trumpets to announce what they're doing in the synagogues and in the streets so that people will praise them. I tell you the truth: they already have their reward.  	“Pi g wo s‑e chehgidamk mamt hekid wo i ha wehmt g shoꞌigkam. Hegam mo s‑e chehgidamk mo i ha wehmt o am hab wua em‑namki ed ch an kahya ch ed. K g hemajkam ab si has ha elid. Neh, id o d ha‑namkidadag. Nt wo si shel em‑ahgi mat g Jiosh pi ab hu has wo ha el.  
MAT06:3	When you give to the poor, don't let your left hand know what your right hand's doing.  	Ahpim amt wabsh s‑aꞌagi wo i ha wehmtad g shoꞌigkam mat pi hedai wo s‑mahchk.  
MAT06:4	That way what you give will be in secret, and your Father who sees what happens in secret will reward you. 	T g em‑ohg Jiosh wo em‑neid k ab wo si has em‑elidad. 
MAT06:5	When you pray, don't be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand up and pray in the synagogues and on the street corners so that people can see them. I promise you, they already have their reward.  	“Pi g wo s‑e chehgidamk mamt hekid wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahu. Hegam mo s‑e chehgidamk at wo gegokiwua k wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahu am em‑namki ed ch an kahya ch ed. Kut wehsijj wo ha neid k ab wo si has ha elidad. Neh, id o d ha namkidadag. Nt wo si shel em‑ahgi mat g Jiosh pi ab hu has wo ha elidad.  
MAT06:6	But you, when you pray, go indoors and close the door, and pray to your Father in private, and your Father who sees what happens in private will reward you.  	Ahpim amt am wo i wahp e‑kih ed k ab wo si i kuh g kihjeg k am wabsh hejelko wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahu Jiosh wui. Kut heg wo waꞌi em‑neidad ch ab wo has em‑elidad. 
MAT06:7	When you pray, don't babble on meaninglessly like the foreigners do, who think they will be heard because of all the words they repeat.  	“Hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh o am wabsh muꞌikko e dahm hab haꞌichu chechꞌe hab elidch mat hab waꞌi masma wo ha kah g Jiosh. Mt wabshaba ahpim pi hab masma hab wo e junihid.  
MAT06:8	Don't be like them, for your Father knows what you need even before you ask him.  	Jiosh o d em‑ohg ch heki hu s‑mahch mam haschu i tatchua mam wa chum koi ab hu tahni haꞌichu.  
MAT06:9	So pray like this: 	Bamt masma am wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahunad: 
MAT06:14	For if you forgive those who sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.  	Neh, bamt masma am wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahunad Jiosh wui wabsh pi chegitok g pi ap ha‑chuꞌijig. T g Jiosh gam hu hab wo i juh g pi ap em‑chuꞌijig.  
MAT06:15	But if you don't forgive those who sin against you, then your heavenly Father won't forgive your sins. 	T wabshaba g em‑chuꞌijig pi gam hab wo i e juh mamtp pi wo pi chegito g ha‑chuꞌijig. 
MAT06:16	When you fast, don't be like the hypocrites who put on sad faces and make themselves look terrible so that everyone can see they're fasting. I tell you the truth, they already have their reward.  	“Pi g wo s‑e chehgidamk mam pi ap e tahtk mamt hekid heꞌekkio pi wo e gegos e hoꞌigeꞌidahunch. Hegam mat wo s‑e chehgidam at wo nei g e‑namkidadag mat g hemajkam ab wo si has ha el. Nt wabshaba wo si shel em‑ahgi mat g Jiosh pi ab hu has wo ha el.  
MAT06:17	Instead, when you fast, wash your face and look smart,  	Am g wo wakon g e‑wuhiosha k ab wo si i gaswua g e‑moꞌo.  
MAT06:18	so that people won't see you're fasting, and your unseen Father who sees what happens in private will reward you. 	T hab pi wo mahchk g hemajkam ab i em‑neidk mam pi e gegosid. T heg wo waꞌi s‑mahchk em‑ohg Jiosh ch ab wo si has em‑elidad. 
MAT06:19	Don't pile up wealth here on earth where moths and rust ruin it, and where thieves break in and steal it.  	“Pi g an hu wo e toꞌidahid g s‑kaisdag id dahm jewed. Tp hems wabsh wo padt o atp hems hema wo em‑ehs.  
MAT06:20	Instead, you should store up your wealth in heaven, where moths and rust don't ruin it, and where thieves don't break in and steal it.  	Mt wabshaba wo hekaj g e‑kaisdag am Jiosh wehhejed. T heg wo wa wepok mam heg an e toꞌidahim Jiosh kihdag ed. T pi hekid wo padt. Kut pi hedai wo em‑ehs.  
MAT06:21	For wherever you store your wealth, that's where your heart will be too. 	Kumt am wo s‑hihimim no pi g em‑tatchuidag am ulinig mo hebai haꞌichug mam haschu hab i elid mo d em‑kaisdag. 
MAT06:22	The eye is like a lamp that lights the body. So if your eye is healthy,  then your whole body will have light.  	“Em‑wuhpui at s‑ap am wo i wahki g tonlig matp wo s‑mamsk  
MAT06:23	But if your eye is evil, then your whole body will be in the dark. If the light in you is darkness, how dark is that!  	k wabshaba pi am hu wo i wahki matp pi wo mamsk. Kum heg hekaj s‑ap nuhkud. Pegih, wahm amt wo si s‑ap nuhkudad g haꞌichu e‑amichudadag mat heg s‑ap am wo i wahki g wohokam. Dat wo si geꞌe s‑chuhugamk em‑wehhejed matp pi wo apꞌek g em‑amichudadag. 
MAT06:24	No one can serve two masters. Either you'll hate one and love the other, or you'll be devoted to one and despise the other. You can't serve both God and Money. 	“Pi at hedai wo e nako mas ha wepo hab masma ab wo ha neidad g gohk e‑aꞌamo. Hemho wa atp hems hema baꞌich wo i s‑wohog elidad. Em‑kaisdag o heg wa wepo mo d em‑ahmo mamtp heg hekaj baꞌich wo i pihk e elidad mam hi g Jiosh. 
MAT06:25	That's why I'm telling you not to worry about your life. Don't worry about what to eat, or what to drink, or what clothes to put on. Isn't life more than food, and the body more than clothes?  	“Neh, nt heg hekaj hab wo em‑ah mamt pi wabsh wo i e kudutad heg hekaj mams haschukaj wo e gegos o mams haschukaj wo e enigadad. Jiosh at ab em‑mah g em‑doakag, pegih, k ab hab waꞌap wo em‑mah mamt haschukaj wo e dagioꞌidad.  
MAT06:26	Look at the birds they don't sow or reap or store food in barns, for your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren't you worth more than they are?  	An g wo i ha neid hegam uꞌuwhig mo an nenꞌe. Idam o pi haꞌichu eꞌeshad ch pi od g haꞌichu esha ch pi gan hu e toꞌidahim g haꞌichu bahidag. K wabshaba g em‑ohg Jiosh ha nuhkud. Kum eda ahpim baꞌich d i si haꞌichu mo g uꞌuwhig.  
MAT06:27	Who of you by worrying can add a minute to your life?  	Pi amt wo e nako mams am baꞌich wo i himch g e‑aꞌahidagga, chum ams hems wo si e kudutad am chegitokch. 
MAT06:28	And why are you worried about clothes? Look at the beautiful flowers in the field. See how they grow: they don't work hard, they don't spin thread.  	“Pi g am wo si e kudutad ab amjed mams haschu ab wo enigat. An g wo i neidad g haꞌichu heosig m an wehsko chuhch. Heg o wa wepo mo si s‑kehg e enigadadch ch eda pi haꞌichu shaꞌi shohshom.  
MAT06:29	But I tell you, not even Solomon in all his glory was dressed like one of these flowers.  	Solomonbad o pi hab masma s‑kehg e enigadadch, chum as d si s‑kais kownal.  
MAT06:30	So if God decorates the fields like this, grass which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, won't he do much more for you, you people who trust so little?  	Neh, haꞌichu wuhshanig o wabsh al heꞌekia tash an hab chuꞌig. K eda g Jiosh si s‑kehg an wuhshad. Kum ahpim baꞌich d i haꞌichu am wehhejed. Kut woho ab wo em‑enigadad. Pegih, mt heg hekaj ab wabsh wo si hiwgad  
MAT06:31	So don't worry, saying, ‘What shall we eat?’ or ‘What shall we drink?’ or ‘What shall we wear?’  	ch pi am hu wo e kudutad ab amjed mams hebai wo bei g e‑gegosig o g e‑wehschuga.  
MAT06:32	These are all the things that the heathen chase after, but your heavenly Father knows everything you need.  	Hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh o id am wa si oid. M eda ahpim d Jiosh aꞌaliga. K heg s‑mahch mam tatchua wehs ihda.  
MAT06:33	Seek his kingdom first, and his way of doing right, and everything will be given to you.  	Wehpeg g am wo i e dagitok Jiosh wui k hab d wo s‑apꞌekamk. Kut heg wehs ab wo i em‑mah mam haschu i tatchua. 
MAT06:34	So don't worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow can worry about itself. There's already enough evil in every day. 	“Pi g am wo shaꞌi e kudutad heg amjed mat haschu has wo i e juh baꞌich tash. Am o wa haꞌichug g em‑kudutadag id i tashkaj ch pi hab chum mahs mams g siꞌalim kudutadag ab wo i wehnad. 
MAT07:1	Don't judge others, so that you won't be judged.  	“Pi g am hedai has wo ahgad nat pi ab uhpam wo i e nodagi em‑wui.  
MAT07:2	For whatever standard you use to judge others will be used to judge you, and whatever measurement you use to measure others will be used to measure you.  	Mamt has i masma wo has ha ahgad, t ab wo i nod em‑wui g has ahgadag hab masma. Ab at wo i e nodagi em‑wui mamt has i masma ab wo neidad hema. 
MAT07:3	Why do you see the speck that's in your brother's eye? Don't you notice the plank that's in your own eye?  	“Pi g am wo si s‑nenꞌoidad g hema chuꞌijig. Tp hems baꞌich i geꞌej g hejel em‑chuꞌijig. Id at heg wo wa wepok mam g chum haꞌichu ab i s‑wuhshdamk wuhij ed mo eda baꞌich i geꞌe haꞌichu ab woꞌo em‑wuhi ed.  
MAT07:4-5	How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take out that speck from your eye’ when you have a plank in your own eye?  You're being hypocritical! First get rid of the plank that's in your own eye. Then you'll be able to see clearly to take out the speck from your brother's eye. 	Do iattogi mamtp hab wo chei mamt haꞌichu ab wo i wuhshad wuhij ed mo eda g baꞌich i geꞌe haꞌichu ab woꞌo em‑wuhi ed. Hemho wa amt wehpeg wo i apꞌech g pi e‑apꞌedag k haha wo e nako mamt wo i apꞌech g hema pi apꞌedag. 
MAT07:6	Don't give dogs what's holy. Don't throw your pearls to pigs. That way the pigs won't trample them underfoot, and the dogs won't turn and attack you. 	“Pi g ab hu wo ha ahgid g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga hegam mo pi ab hu tatchua. Heg at wo wa wepok mamt g s‑ta keꞌidam gogogs ab wo ha mah g hekia s‑apꞌekam haꞌichu o g kokji ab wo ha mah g si s‑namkig babiuga. Gogogs at hi ab wabsh wo i nehni k wo s‑koꞌokam has wo em‑juh. T g kokji hi wabsh wo kehiwia g babiuga. 
MAT07:7-8	Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you. Everyone who asks, receives; everyone who seeks, finds; and everyone who knocks has the door opened for them.  	“Ab g wo ha tahnid haꞌichu k ab wo bebhed. Am g wo e gahgidad haꞌichu k wo cheh. Ab g wo shontpagad. T ab wo i e kuhpiꞌo g pualit em‑wehhejed.  
MAT07:9	Would any of you give your son a stone if he asked for bread?  	Ahpim oꞌog, namt hig wabsh g hodai wo mah g e‑alidag mat g simito wo em‑tai  
MAT07:10	Or if he asked for fish, would you give him a snake?  	o wabsh g wamad wo mah mat g watopi hidod ab wo em‑tai?  
MAT07:11	So if even you who are evil know to give good things to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good things to those who ask him. 	Chum ams d pi apꞌekam ch eda s‑mahch mamt s‑kehg haꞌichu wo ha mah g e‑aꞌaliga. Wahm hig g em‑ohg Jiosh at woho baꞌich i s‑kehg haꞌichu ab wo em‑mah mamt ab wo tahnid haꞌichu. 
MAT07:12	Treat others the way you want them to treat you. This sums up the law and the prophets.  	“Am g hab wo ha juhkchid g hemajkam mam has i chum ha elid mat hab wo em‑juhkchid. Bamt masma wehs am hab wo juh mo haschu an oꞌohanas Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana ed. 
MAT07:13-14	Enter by the narrow entrance. For the entrance is wide, and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and many travel that way.  But the entrance is narrow, and the way is difficult that leads to life, and only a few find it. 	“Am g wo i e dagitok Jiosh wui k ab wo s‑wohog elidad.

I tell my servant, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.” 	Bo wa masma ab haꞌichu ni‑chehani g ni‑geꞌejig. Kuni ab s‑wohog elid. K g ni‑shondalig hab waꞌap ab s‑ni‑wohog elid.

MAT08:28	When he arrived on the other side, in the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men came out of the graveyard to meet him. They were so dangerous that nobody dared to travel that way.  	Tsh am aigo dada. K amai d ha‑chekshani g Gadarene hemajkam. Sh am ge chehchog mo am g koꞌi e toꞌaw. Tsh gohk ab i wuwha g chechoj.

MAT08:32	“Go!” said Jesus. The demons left the men and went into the pigs. The whole herd ran down the steep hillside into the sea and drowned.  	Sh hab ha ahg g Jesus, “Hijiwo.” 
MAT08:33	The pig herders ran away. They went to the town and told the people there everything that had taken place, and what had happened to the demon-possessed men.  	Kutsh hegam mash am ha nuhkud idam kokji gam hu si wohp k am dada kihhim t am k am ha ahgid mat haschu has e juh am ha tahgio idam oꞌodham mash g jijawul an ha uꞌukch.

MAT09:34	But the Pharisees remarked, “He throws out demons using the power of the chief of demons.” 	Kud wabshaba g Palasi hab kaij, “Jijawul ha‑geꞌejig o ab mahkch g gewkdag. Kuki heg hekaj e nakog ch ab i ha wuwhasid g jijawul.” 
MAT09:35	Jesus went all over, visiting the towns and villages. He taught in their synagogues, telling them about the good news of the kingdom, and he healed all kinds of sicknesses and diseases.

MAT09:36	When he saw the crowds, Jesus was deeply moved with compassion for them, because they were troubled and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.  	D muꞌi ab wui e chehm g hemajkam. Kudki g Jesus si i s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌel no pi si e kudut ch e shoꞌigchud hab sha masma mat g kakawal hab wo e wuad pi e nuhkudch.

Kuch eda pi muꞌij ahchim mach am ha ahgidahim g doꞌibiadag ahga. Id o heg wa wepo mat hebai g ha‑hihka wo si geꞌejk. T g ha‑pionag pi wo muꞌijk.

MAT10:9-10	Don't carry any gold, silver, or copper coins in your pockets,  or a bag for your journey, or two cloaks, or sandals, or a walking stick, for a worker deserves to be supported.  	“K wabshaba ab d ha‑wuikam hegam mat ab wo em‑kaiha mat ab aigo wo i em‑wehmaj k wo em‑dagioꞌi.

MAT10:11-14	Wherever you go, whatever town or village, ask for someone who lives according to good principles, and remain there until you leave.  When you enter the house, give it your blessing.  If the home deserves it, let your peace rest on it, but if it doesn't deserve it, let your peace return to you. If someone doesn't welcome you, and refuses to listen to what you have to say, then leave that house or that town, shaking its dust off your feet as you go.  	“Mt am wo i wahp kihhim ch ed k an wo i ha gahghi hegam mat hedai s‑ap ab wo i em‑nei k ab ha wui hab wo chei, ‘Jiosh o ab em‑makiog g si geꞌe s‑ap tahhadkam.’ Kut am wo i em‑wahpkid k wo em‑dagioꞌi am hugkam mamt hekid gm hu baꞌich ep wo i hihi.

MAT10:24-25	Disciples are not more important than their teacher; servants are not more important than their master.  Disciples should be satisfied to become like their teacher, and servants like their master. If the head of the house has been called the head demon Beelzebub,  then the members of his household will be demonized even more!  	“E mashchamdam o ab wabsh wecho hegai mo d ha mashchamdam ch heg hekaj wepo wo nako haꞌichu.

MAT10:28	Don't be afraid of those who can kill you physically, but can't kill you spiritually. Instead, be afraid of the one who can destroy you physically and spiritually in the fires of destruction. 	Pi g wo shaꞌi ha ehbidad hegam matp hedai wo chum s‑em‑kokdaim.

MAT10:29-31	Aren't two sparrows sold for just one penny? But not a single one of them falls to the ground without your Father knowing about it.  Even the hairs on your head have all been counted.  So don't worry—you're worth more than many sparrows! 	“K wabshaba g Jiosh si s‑hemajima ch pi tatchua mas wo s‑koꞌokam em‑juh. Am g wo oidahim mo chum hems g al uꞌuwhig s‑ap ha nuhkud.

Those who welcome someone who does right will receive the same reward as someone who does right.  	Hegai mat hedai s‑ap ab wo i ha nei g ni‑chuhchai at ha wepo wo bei g s‑kehg mahkigdag.

MAT11:25-26	Then Jesus prayed, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for you've hidden these things from the clever and sophisticated. Instead you've revealed them to ordinary people.

MAT12:13	Then he said to the man, “Hold out your hand.” The man held out his hand, and it was healed, just as healthy as the other hand. 	Neh, bad kaij ch hab hahawa ahg g mahnikokam, “Ab g si i shelin g e‑nowi.” Kud am wabsh i chum shelin k am waꞌi hekaj apꞌet.  
MAT12:14	But the Pharisees went out and plotted how to kill Jesus.  	D amjed gam hu hihi g Palasi k e wehm aꞌaga mat has hig masma wo mua g Jesus. 
MAT12:15	Knowing this, Jesus left, with large crowds following him. He healed all of them,  	D am i kah g Jesus mash am s‑muꞌamk k gam hu hih ab amjed amai. Kud muꞌi hemajkam am i oi. D wehs ha dodaj g kokꞌodam  
MAT12:16	but instructed them not to tell people who he was.  	ab si ha chehanich mat pi hedai haꞌichu wo ahgidad ab amjed.  
MAT12:17	This fulfilled what Isaiah the prophet said: 	Neh, bad wa masma hab e juh hegai matki g Isaiabad heki hu waꞌi oꞌoha matsh hab wo e juh. Oꞌohanaj o hab chuꞌig mash g Jiosh an aꞌaga g si e‑kehsha ch hab kaij: 
MAT12:22	Then a man was brought to Jesus who was demon-possessed and blind and dumb. Jesus healed him, so that the dumb man could speak and see.  	D haꞌi g hemajkam am hema uꞌapa g oꞌodham Jesus wui. Kudki id pi nead ch pi ha neok nadki pi g jiawul an uꞌukch. D g Jesus doaj ihda oꞌodham. D hahawa e nako mad neok k ep haꞌichu neid. 
MAT12:23	All the crowds were amazed, and asked, “Could this really be the son of David?” 	D g muꞌi hemajkam ab si has i el ihda k hab kaij, “Shahag wepo mo id d hegai Davidbad amjedkam mach ab nenida.” 
MAT12:24	But when the Pharisees heard this, they replied, “This man can only throw out demons through the power of Beelzebub, the chief of demons!” 	D am i ha kah hegam Palasi k hab kaij, “Moki g jijawul ha‑geꞌejig ab mahkch g gewkdag. Kuki heg hekaj gam hu hab i ha wua g jijawul ab ha amjed hegam mo an ha uꞌukch.” 
MAT12:25	Knowing what they were thinking, Jesus told them, “Any kingdom that is divided against itself will be destroyed. No town or household that is divided against itself can stand.  	D g Jesus s‑mahch mo haschu am chegito ch hab kaij ab ha wui, “S‑mahch am mat g oꞌodham wo padch g hejel e‑jewedga o g hejel e‑kihhim mat ab aꞌai wo e cheggia. T g e‑wehm kihkam hab waꞌap wo padch g hejel e‑kihdag mat ab aꞌai wo e cheggia.  
MAT12:26	If Satan drives out Satan, then he's divided against himself—so how could his kingdom stand?  	Pegih, t has hig masma g ge Jiawul pi wo padch g hejel e‑kownaltalig matp ab wo sha ni‑mah g gewkdag mant am wo i ha wuwhas g piongaj.  
MAT12:27	If I'm throwing out demons in the name of Beelzebub, in whose name are your people throwing out demons? Your own people prove you're wrong!  	Neh, hegam mo ab si em‑wecho e mashcham o hab waꞌap i ha wuwhasid g jijawul. Kum eda pi hab masma hab ha elid mo g Jiawul ab ha mahkch g gewkdag. Pegih, id o am wohokamchud mo pi woho hegai mam hab chum elid.  
MAT12:28	But if I'm throwing out demons through the power of the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you! 	Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag o ab ni‑mahkch ihda gewkdag mani hekaj gam hu hab i ha wua g jijawul. K id am wohokamchud mat heki hu in i wuhsh g Jiosh kownaltalig em‑shahgid. 
MAT12:29	Can you enter a strong man's house and take his belongings unless you tie him up first? If you do that then you can take everything in his house.  	“Neh, wohppoꞌid ani g ge Jiawul hegam mo an ha uꞌukch. Kum s‑mahch mat pi hedai wo e nako mas am hu wabsh wo wah hema kih ed mat wo s‑haꞌahamak k am wo ui g enigaj, heg hi wa matp wehpeg wo wulsh. 
MAT12:30	Those who are not with me are against me, and those who do not gather together with me do the opposite: they are scattering.  	“Hegai matp hedai pi ab hu wo i ni‑wehmajk o ab ni‑wui kehk ch wabsh ha gantan hegam mani s‑ha doꞌibiamk.  
MAT12:31	That's why I'm telling you that every sin and blasphemy you commit will be forgiven, except blasphemy against the Spirit which won't be forgiven.  	Wehs o gam hu hab i junihog g pi ap ha‑chuꞌijig g Jiosh. K wabshaba si geꞌej g em‑chuꞌijig mamtp ab wo has ah g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. T g Jiosh pi hekid gam hu hab wo i juh.  
MAT12:32	Those who say something against the Son of man will be forgiven, but those who say something against the Holy Spirit won't be forgiven, neither in this life nor the next.  	Im at hu hab wo i juh g Jiosh g chuꞌijigaj hegai mat ab wo has ni‑ah ahni Jiosh si Kehsha k wabshaba pi hekid gam hu hab wo i juh g chuꞌijigaj hegai mat wo has ah g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. 
MAT12:33	Either decide that the tree is good, and its fruit is good, or decide that the tree is bad and its fruit is bad—for the tree is known by its fruit.  	“Mt wo s‑mai mas hedai d s‑apꞌekam oꞌodham hab masma mamt wo s‑mai mas s‑kehgaj g bahidkam uhs. S‑kehg uhs at wo s‑kehg bahidagt. T g pi kehg uhs wo pi kehg bahidagt.  
MAT12:34	You viper's brood, how can you who are evil say anything good? For your mouth simply says what your mind is busy thinking about.  	Ahpim Palasi am hab sha masma mam d kohkꞌoi ch pi wo shaꞌi e nako mams s‑kehg haꞌichu hab wo chei nam pi d pi apꞌekam ch hemho wa am hab wo chei mo haschu am hab i chuꞌig em‑ihbdag ed.  
MAT12:35	A good person brings out good from their store of good things, and an evil person brings out evil from their store of evil things.  	S‑kehg haꞌichu o am hab chuꞌig ihbdaj ed g s‑apꞌekam oꞌodham. Kut heg s‑kehg haꞌichu hab wo kaijjid. K pi kehg haꞌichu am hab chuꞌig ihbdaj ed g pi apꞌekam oꞌodham. Kut heg pi kehg haꞌichu hab wo kaijjid. 
MAT12:36-37	I tell you, people will have to account for every careless thing they say on the Day of Judgment.  For what you say will either vindicate you or condemn you.” 	“Id ant hab wo chei mat hemho wa wehs haꞌichu am wo mahsko e wua lodaita tash ch ed mam haschu has i kaij id dahm jewed. Jiosh at wo hekaj g hejel em‑neꞌoki mat wo em‑lodai, chum hems g s‑pehegi em‑neꞌoki.” 
MAT12:38	Then some of the religious teachers and Pharisees came to him and said, “Teacher, we want you to show us a miraculous sign.” 	D am haꞌi haꞌichug g chehanig t‑mashchamdam ch Palasi ch hab ahg g Jesus, “Ha mashchamdam, ab g t‑chehgid g s‑hasig haꞌichukaj maptp woho d Jiosh si Kehsha.” 
MAT12:39	“Evil people who don't trust in God are the ones who look for a miraculous sign. The only sign they will be given is the sign of the prophet Jonah,” Jesus told them.  	D hab kaij g Jesus, “Si o hig woho pi apꞌe ch mehk ab amjed g Jiosh hegam mat pi ab hu wo ni‑hiwgam k hoꞌip nei g s‑hasig haꞌichu. Heg ant ab wo waꞌi ha chehgi mant am oidk hab wo ni‑juh hegai Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam mash hab chehgig Jonah.  
MAT12:40	“In the same way Jonah was in the belly of a huge fish for three days and three nights, the Son of man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.  	Id ash wa waik tash oidam am haꞌichug geꞌe watopi wohk ed. Neh, nt hab wa masma waik tash oidam am wo kahchk hihaꞌini ch ed ahni Jiosh si Kehsha. 
MAT12:41	The people of Nineveh will rise in the judgment together with this generation and they will condemn it because they repented in response to Jonah's message—and as you see, there's someone greater than Jonah here!  	“Jonabad ash wa am ha ahgid g Ninevah t am hemajkam g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. Kutsh wa gam hu s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegitoi k hab pi ab hu wo e chuꞌijigch geꞌe lodaita tash ch ed. Ni ahni baꞌich d i si haꞌichu mo g Jonabad. Kum eda pi ab hu ni‑kaiham ch heg hekaj ab wo motoig g chuꞌijig lodaita tash ed. 
MAT12:42	The Queen of the South will be raised in the judgment together with this generation and will condemn it because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon—and as you see, there's someone greater than Solomon here!  	“Mehkjed atsh ab i hih g uwi kownal ab Sheba jewed t amjed matsh ab wo kaiha g Solomonbad haꞌichu mahchig. Ni ahni baꞌich d i si haꞌichu mo g Solomonbad. Kum eda pi ab hu ni‑kaiham ch heg hekaj ab wo motoig g chuꞌijig lodaita tash ed.” 
MAT12:43	When an evil spirit leaves someone, it wanders through deserted places looking for rest, and finds nowhere to stay.  	Kud hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Matp hems g jiawul an wo hema uꞌukch g oꞌodham k wabsh wo dagito mat am hebai ep wo e ul. Kut hegai oꞌodham wo i chum kegch g e‑doakag. T wabshaba g jiawul pi hebai wo chehg.  
MAT12:44	So it says, ‘I'll go back to the place I left,’ and when it returns it finds the place empty, all clean and tidy.  	K hekaj hab wo i e ah, ‘Mo hig woho d ni‑kih hegai oꞌodham. Nt hig am uhpam wo hih wui.’ Kut wa woho am wo uhpam him k wo cheh mo am wabsh jeg ch si kegchudas ch hehosimhunas.  
MAT12:45	Then it goes and brings back seven other spirits even more evil than it is, and it enters and lives there. So the person ends up worse than they were at the beginning. That's the way it will be with this evil generation.” 	T am haha wo him k wewaꞌak ep wo ha uꞌapa g jijawul. T idam baꞌich wo i pi apꞌek ch am wehmaj wo i chiwia. T ihda oꞌodham baꞌich wo i pi apꞌek mo wa ga hu i heki hu. Neh, bat wa masma hab wo e juh hegam mat pi gam hu wo s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegitoi.” 
MAT12:46	While he was speaking to the crowds, his mother and his brothers arrived and stood outside, wanting to talk to him.  	Am ad wabsh kia ha wui neok g hemajkam g Jesus. Kud am haha wabsh dada g jeꞌej ch wepngaj s‑neidamk. D wabshaba si muꞌij g hemajkam an wehgaj. Kud heg hekaj gam hu wabsh mehk gegok. 
MAT12:47	Someone came and told him, “Look, your mother and brothers are outside, wanting to talk to you.” 	D hema hegam mo an wehgaj gegok g Jesus hab kaij ab wui, “M‑jeꞌe ch m‑wepnag ash am hu gegok ch s‑m‑neidamk.” 
MAT12:48-49	“Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?” Jesus asked.  He pointed at his disciples, and said, “Look, they are my mother and my brothers!  	D g Jesus hab ahg, “Neh, idam mo ab ni‑kaiham o heg wa wepo mo d ni‑jeꞌe ch ni‑wepnag.  
MAT12:50	For those who do the will of my heavenly Father, they are my brother, sister, and mother!” 	Hegam mat hab wo junihid g ni‑ohg Jiosh tatchui o hab masma mo d ni‑wepnag ch ni‑jeꞌe.” 
MAT13:1	Later that day Jesus left the house, and sat down to teach  beside the lake.  	Heg waꞌi tash ed achd gam hu hihi Galilee Kahchki wui. D am i chum dahiwua g Jesus mat wo t‑mashcha.  
MAT13:2	So many people gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat down there to teach, while all the crowds stood on the beach.  	Kud wabshaba shaꞌi muꞌi hemajkam an e hemapai wehgaj. D heg hekaj gan hu i chesh g Jesus wahlko ch ed k an dahiwua k amjed ha mashcham. D g hemajkam an gegok shuhdagi koa an ch amjed ab kaiham.  
MAT13:3	He explained many things to them, using stories as illustrations. 	Kud muꞌi haꞌichu ha tashogid g wepogida ahgakaj ab amjed g Jiosh kownaltalig. Id o d haꞌichu ahgaj mo hab kaij: 
MAT13:4	“As he was sowing, some of the seeds fell on the path. The birds came and ate them up.  	T haꞌi gan hu shul wohg ch ed. T g uꞌuwhig am dada k koꞌito.  
MAT13:5	Other seeds fell on stony ground where there wasn't much earth where they sprouted quickly.  	T haꞌi gan hu shul waw t ab mo pi geꞌej g jewed k ab ha hekaj hi wa chum i wuhsh no pi pi an hu juhk g jewed.  
MAT13:6	The sun rose and scorched them and they withered because they had no roots.  	T ab i chesh g tash. Kut wabsh gaksh no ge mehk tatk.  
MAT13:7	Other seeds fell among thorns that grew up and choked them.  	T haꞌi gan hu shul shaꞌi ch ed. Kut g shaꞌi ab i geꞌege k ha kokda g haꞌichu esha.  
MAT13:8	Still other seeds fell on good soil. They produced a harvest—some one hundred, some sixty, and some thirty times what had been planted.  	T wabshaba hegam mat an s‑ap shul moihuna ch ed an wuhshani k muꞌi ab kait. Haꞌi at siant ab kait ch haꞌi chuhdpo wehst‑mahm ch haꞌi waikko wehst‑mahm.”  
MAT13:9	Anybody who has ears should be listening!” 	Kud hab hahawa ep kaij g Jesus, “Neh, am g wo s‑ap i aꞌamichud ihda.” 
MAT13:10	The disciples came to Jesus and asked him, “Why do you use illustrations when you speak to the people?” 	D am hahawa i e hejelko. Kuchd am wui hihim k ab kakke mas haschu ahgch pi ta amichudam ha mashcham g haꞌichu wepogidakaj. 
MAT13:11	“You're privileged to have revealed to you the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but they're not given such insights,” Jesus replied.  	D hab kaij, “Nt wo em‑ahgi mo has d ahga no pi g Jiosh em‑hiwgid mamt wo s‑mai mo haschu hemu am maskogid ab amjed g e‑kownaltalig. Ni wabshaba heg waꞌi ha ahgid haꞌichu wepogida ahga hegam mo pi ab hu wohochudamk. T hab pi wo amich haꞌichu ab amjed g Jiosh kownaltalig.  
MAT13:12	“Those who already have will have more given to them, more than enough. But those who don't have, whatever they have will be taken away from them.  	Hegam mat s‑ap wo hekaj g e‑apꞌedag at baꞌich ep wo i nei. T hegam mat pi ap wo hekaj wabsh wo heb hu wua.  
MAT13:13	That's why I speak to them in illustrations. For even though they see, they do not see; and even though they hear, they do not hear; nor do they understand. 	Heg ani hekaj g haꞌichu wepogidakaj haꞌichu ha ahgid: 
MAT13:18	So listen to the story of the sower.  	“Am ant haha wo em‑ahgi mani haschu chum em‑mashcham id hekaj haꞌichu ni‑ahga ab amjed g haꞌichu eshdam. Heg kaichka ani wepogid g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. Id o am e gantan ha shahgid g hemajkam hab masma mo g haꞌichu kai.  
MAT13:19	When people hear the message about the kingdom, and don't understand it, the Evil One comes along and rips out what was sown in their heart. This is what happens to the seeds sown on the path.  	K eda haꞌi pi amichud no pi g ha‑iꞌibdag s‑kawpk hab sha masma mo g wohg. K g Jiawul am wabsh s‑pehegi ha wohppoꞌid mo haschu i kah. 
MAT13:20	The seeds sown on stony ground are people who hear the message and happily accept it straight away.  	“K haꞌi g ha‑iꞌibdag hab sha masma mo hebai pi geꞌej g jewed ab waw t ab. K idam si s‑hohhoꞌid ch kah g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga  
MAT13:21	They last for a while, but because they don't have roots, when problems and troubles come, they quickly fall away.  	ch wabshaba pi wihnam ab hu uꞌukch ch am hi wa heꞌes wo i s‑chegitokahimch. T oi wa g kudutadag ab ha wui wo i hih. Kumt wo ha shoꞌigch id hekaj Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. T ha hekaj wabsh wo taꞌi i shul. 
MAT13:22	The seeds sown among thorns are people who hear the message, but then life's worries and the temptation of money choke the message so that they become fruitless.  	“K haꞌi g ha‑iꞌibdag hab sha masma mo hebai s‑shaꞌig. K am ha shaꞌijidch g pihk ha‑elidadag ch s‑ha‑kaisdag. Kut pi haꞌichu wehhejed wo s‑kehgajk am Jiosh wehhejed. 
MAT13:23	The seeds sown on good soil are people who hear the message, and understand it, and who produce a good harvest—some one hundred, some sixty, and some thirty times what was sown.” 	“K haꞌi g ha‑iꞌibdag s‑moik hab sha masma mo g moihuna. Idam at wo s‑amich g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga k am wo ahgachugad matp hems haꞌi siant ab ep wo ha baꞌiha k atp hems haꞌi chuhdpo wehst‑mahm k haꞌi g waikko wehst‑mahm ab ep wo ha baꞌiha.” 
MAT13:24	Then he told them another illustrated story: “The kingdom of heaven is like a farmer who sowed good seeds in his field.  	Jesus ad am hema ep ha ahgi g hemajkam g haꞌichu wepogida hab kaijch, “Am ant baꞌichu ep wo i em‑tashogi g Jiosh kownaltalig wepogidch mat hema ei g s‑kehg kai e‑oid ed.  
MAT13:25	But while his workers were sleeping, an enemy came and sowed weed seeds on top of the wheat. Then they left.  	T am hu hebai haha wabsh hema jiwia g obgaj chuhug ch ed mo wehsijj kohksh k g shaꞌi kai am ei ha shahgid g pilkani k gam hu hahawa ep hih.  
MAT13:26	So when the wheat grew and produced ears of grain, the weeds also grew up.  	Kut am i wuhsh g eꞌes k ab i mudadt. T am hahawa s‑masma i wuhsh g shaꞌi. 
MAT13:27	The farmer's workers came and asked him, ‘Sir, didn't you sow good seeds in your field? Where did the weeds come from?’ 	“K hab kaij g eshdam pionag, ‘S hebai amjed i wuhsh g shaꞌi mapt wa eda t‑mah g s‑kehg kaichka.’ 
MAT13:28	‘Some enemy has done this,’ he replied. ‘Do you want us to go and pull up the weeds?’ they asked him.  	“K hab kaij am ha wui, ‘Ni‑obga at hab juh ihda.’ 
MAT13:29	‘No,’ he answered, ‘as you pull up the weeds, you might uproot the wheat too.  	“K hab ha ahg, ‘Piaꞌa. Mt wo am hu wabsh g pilkani ha huhpsh.  
MAT13:30	Let them both grow until harvest, and then at harvest-time I'll tell the reapers, “First gather the weeds, tie them up into bundles and burn them. Then gather the wheat and store it in my barn.” ’ ” 	Am g wabsh wo hiwgid mat am e wehm wo wuwha. T ab wo e ai mat wo e hih. Kunt hab haha wo ha ahgi g hihkdam mat g shaꞌi wehpeg am wo ha huhpsh k am wo i hemapad k ged hu wo mehid k am haha wo i hemapai g pilkani k ged hu wo i baꞌiha.’ Neh, bo kaij g ha‑ahmo.” 
MAT13:31	He gave them another illustration: “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a farmer sowed in his field.  	D am hema ep ah g haꞌichu wepogida g Jesus hab kaijch, “Am ant heꞌes wo i em‑tashogi g Jiosh kownaltalig am wepogidch g haꞌichu kai.  
MAT13:32	Even though it's the tiniest of seeds it grows much bigger than other plants. In fact it grows into a tree big enough for birds to roost in its branches.” 	Neh, heg am eꞌesha mo al chumaj ch oi wa am wo wuhshani k haꞌas wo i geꞌeda mo g s‑ehheg uhs. Tp hems g uꞌuwhig an ab wo koksht. Pegih, t hab wa masma wo geꞌe i geꞌeda g Jiosh kownaltalig, chum as al chum am wo shonwua.” 
MAT13:33	He told them another illustrated story: “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman mixed with a large quantity of flour, until all the dough was raised.”  	D am hema ep ah g haꞌichu wepogida g Jesus hab kaijch, “Jiosh kownaltalig o hab waꞌap wepogidas mo g jewajidakud. Heg amt wo be k am wo wah wehnadk g chuꞌi k am heꞌes wo i dai. T wo chehmo g wahga mat wehs am wo i kopodka. Pegih, t g Jiosh kownaltalig hab wa masma wo chehmo g jewed.” 
MAT13:34	Jesus explained all these things to the crowds using illustrated stories—in fact he didn't speak to them without using stories.  	Jesus ad haschu i ha ahgid g hemajkam ch heg waꞌi hekaj haꞌichu wepogida ahga.  
MAT13:35	This fulfilled the prophet's words: “I will speak using stories, and I will explain things hidden from the creation of the world.” 	Heki atki hu waꞌi oꞌoha g kelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam mat id am hab wo wa e juh. K hab chuꞌig g oꞌohanaj: 
MAT13:36	Then he left the crowds and went into a house. His disciples came over to him, and asked him, “Please explain to us the story about the weeds in the field.” 	D g Jesus gam hu ha dagito g hemajkam k ged hu i wah kih ch ed. Kuchd am wehmaj hihim k ab hahawa kakke mas has d ahga hegai wepogida ahga ab amjed g shaꞌi mo am t‑ahgid. 
MAT13:37	“The one who sows the good seed is the Son of man,” Jesus explained.  	D hab kaij, “Heg ani wepogidas mo g haꞌichu eshdam ahni Jiosh si Kehsha.  
MAT13:38-39	“The field is the world. The good seeds are the children of the kingdom. The weed seeds are the children of the Evil One.  The enemy that sowed the weed seeds is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world. The reapers are angels.  	K g oidag d ihda jewed. K g s‑kehg kai d hegam mat wo e doꞌibia k am wo haꞌichugk Jiosh kownaltalig ed. K g ni‑obga d jijawul ha‑geꞌejig. K g eshaj d hegam mat pi wo e doꞌibia. Hihka tash o d lodaita tash. K hegam mat hab wo juh g hihka d anghil. 
MAT13:40	Just as the weeds are harvested and burned so it will be at the end of the world.  	“Hegai shaꞌi mehidda o hab d ahga mat g pi ap hehemajkam gam hu wo i e shul jiawul kih ed mat hekid wo i e ai g lodaita tash.  
MAT13:41	The Son of man will send out his angels, and they will gather up every sinful thing and everyone who does evil,  	Am ant wo i ha chuhcha g anghil ahni Jiosh si Kehsha. Kut ab wo i hihi jewed wui k gam hu hab wo i juh hegai matp haschu am wo i em‑wua pi apꞌekam ch ed

MAT13:43	Then those who live rightly will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their father. Anybody with ears should be listening! 	T am hahawa wo si tondad g s‑apꞌekam hemajkam e‑ohg Jiosh kownaltalig ed. Neh, am g wo i aꞌamichud ihda ahpim mam kah!” 
MAT13:44	The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. A man found it, reburied it, and then full of joy went and sold all he had and bought that field.  	D am hema ep ah g Jesus g haꞌichu wepogida ahga hab kaijch, “Jiosh kownaltalig o heg wepogidas mo g s‑namkig haꞌichu mat am hema ehsto oidag ch ed k hahawa muh. T am hema haha wabsh chehg k am wabsh uhpam i maꞌishp k si s‑hehgig ch am i wehs gagda g haꞌichu e‑eniga k am hahawa uhpam ep him k wabsh wehs ha nolawt ihda oidag.” 
MAT13:45-46	The kingdom of heaven is also like a trader looking for good pearls.  When he found the most expensive pearl ever he went and sold all he had and bought it.  	Kud hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Bamt masma wo s‑behim g Jiosh kownaltalig mat g s‑namkig hohodai nolawtdam wo s‑behim hegai mat wehs ha baꞌich wo i s‑kehgajk. Heg at wehs wo gagda g haꞌichu e‑eniga mat wo e nakog k wo ha nolawt hegai s‑namkigchu.” 
MAT13:47	Once more, the kingdom of heaven is like a fishing net thrown into the sea that caught all kinds of fish.  	D hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Am ant heꞌes wo i em‑tashogi g Jiosh kownaltalig am wepogidch g waptopi uꞌikud chuagia. Heg at am wo wua g waptopi ha uꞌudam shuhdagi ch ed. T am wo e baꞌiha g nahnko mahs waptopi.  
MAT13:48	When it was full it was dragged ashore. The good fish were put into baskets while the bad ones were thrown away. 	Kut am wo i wanchkwua shuhdagi hugid an k am wo dahiwua k wo i ha gawulkad k hegam wo e toꞌi mo s‑kehgaj k g pi kehg waptopi gam hu wo nehnich.  
MAT13:49	That's the way it will be when the end of the world comes. The angels will go out and separate the evil people from the good,  	Bat wo wa masmak mat hekid wo i e ai g lodaita tash. Anghil at am wo aꞌai hihim k am wo i ha gawulkai g pi apꞌekam hemajkam

MAT14:19	He told the crowds to sit down on the grass. Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven and blessed them. After that he broke the loaves into pieces and gave the bread to the disciples, and the disciples gave it to the crowds.  	D am hahawa ha cheha g hemajkam mat am wo dadhaiwua washai ch ed.

MAT16:21	From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he would have to go Jerusalem, and that he would suffer terribly at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and religious teachers; and that he would be killed, but he would rise again on the third day.

MAT17:20	“Because you don't trust enough,” Jesus told them. “I tell you, even if your trust was as small as a mustard seed, you could say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it would move. Nothing would be impossible for you.”  	D hab kaij g Jesus, “Heg amt hekaj pi e nako mam pi ab hu wohochud mat hab wo e juh.

MAT17:27	But to avoid giving offense to anyone, go to the lake, and throw out a fishing line with a hook. Pull in the first fish you catch, and when you open its mouth there you'll find a <span class="it">stater</span> coin. Take the coin and give it to them for both me and you.” 	Ch wabshaba pi tatchua machs wo ha kudu idam hemajkam. Kupt heg hekaj am wo hih shuhdagi wui k am wo wua g waptopi hukshpakud.

MAT18:2	Jesus called over a small child. He had the child stand in front of them.  	D eda an hema kehk g al chum ali. D g Jesus am i waid k ab t‑baꞌich i kehsh

MAT18:6	But anyone who makes one of these little ones who trust in me sin, it would be better for them to have a large millstone tied around their neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea. 	“S‑toꞌo ehbidam hab mahs am wehhejed hegai mat hema am wo i ha wanchkwua pi apꞌekam wui idam al aꞌal mo ab al ni‑hiwig.

MAT18:8-9	If your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It's better for you to enter eternal life crippled or lame rather than to have two hands or two feet and to be thrown into eternal fire.  If your eye causes you to sin, pull it out and throw it away. It's better for you to enter eternal life with one eye than to have two eyes and to be thrown into the fire of judgment.  	“Pi at hedai wo e nako mas ab uhpam wo i wuhsh Jiawul kih amjed.

MAT18:11	  	Ia ant jiwia jewed dahm mant wo ha doꞌibia g heb hu hihimkam.] 
MAT18:12	What do you think about this? If a man has a hundred sheep, and one of them gets lost, won't he leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go in search of the one that's lost?  	“Neh, am g wo i oidahim ihda.

MAT18:13	And if he finds it, I tell you he really rejoices over that sheep more than the ninety-nine that didn't get lost.  	Kut woho d wo s‑hehgigk mamtp wo cheh.  
MAT18:14	In the same way my heavenly Father does not want any of these little ones to be lost. 	Bo wa masma pi shaꞌi tatchua g em‑ohg Jiosh mat hema wo heb hu hih idam al chuꞌuchum aꞌal. 
MAT18:15	If a brother  sins against you, go and point out the wrong to him, just between the two of you. If he listens to you, you've won your brother over.  	“Mt heg waꞌi hejel wo ahgi e‑wehm wohochuddam matp pi ap wo chuꞌi ab em‑wui. Kutp hems ab s‑ap wo em‑kaiha.

MAT18:28	But when that same servant went out he found one of his fellow-servants who owed him just a hundred denarii. He grabbed him by the neck and choked him, saying, ‘Pay me back what you owe me!’  	Kut am hih ihda oꞌodham. 
MAT18:29	His fellow-servant threw himself down at the man's feet and begged him, ‘Please be patient with me! I will pay you back!’  	“Kut ihda wehmaj pion ab i gei wecho k ab i e shoꞌigchud wui mat ab wabsh wo i nenida. Kut wo wa uhpam namkid.

The kingdom of heaven belongs to those who are like them!”  	D hab kaij g Jesus, “Ab g wabsh wo i ha hiwgid g aꞌal mat ab wo i hihi ni‑wui k pi an hu wo shaꞌi ha shohbi.

But if you want to have eternal life, then keep the commandments.” 	K hab kaij g Jesus, “Ab ap ni‑kakke ab amjed g s‑apꞌekam. K eda heg waꞌi Jiosh d s‑apꞌekam.

MAT19:18	“Which ones?” the man asked him. 	D hab kaij g oꞌodham, “Hedai hegam chehanig?”

MAT19:21	Jesus told him, “If you want to be perfect, then go and sell your possessions, give the money to the poor, and you'll have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me.” 	D hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Pegih, pt am wo him k wo gagda wehs haꞌichu map haschu i eniga k wo ha mah g namkigaj g shoꞌigkam k ab wo i him k wo ni‑oidad maptp woho s‑behimk hegai map chum e gahgid.”

MAT19:23	“I tell you the truth,” Jesus said to his disciples, “rich people find it hard to enter the kingdom of heaven.  	D hab hahawa ep kaij g Jesus ab t‑wui, “Neh, nt wo si shel em‑ahgi mat wo shaꞌi si s‑hasigk mas g s‑kakais am wo i wahp Jiosh kownaltalig ed.

MAT19:28	Jesus replied, “I tell you the truth: when everything is remade and the Son of man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

MAT20:1	For the kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.  	“Id ant am wo em‑tashogi id hekaj mant wo haꞌichu wepogi g Jiosh kownaltalig. Heg o wepogidas mat g uhdwis oidag enigakam wabsh i siꞌalim am him k haꞌi ha ui g oꞌodham mat am wo chikp oidaj ed.  
MAT20:2	He agreed to pay the workers one denarius for the day, and sent them to work in his vineyard.  	T g ha‑namkidadag d wo hegaik mo haschu i uꞌu g pion tash ab. T am ha hekaj hihim k chikp. 
MAT20:3	Around 9 a.m. he went out and saw others without work standing in the marketplace. 	“T am hahawa ep hih humukt ohla ch ed. K am haꞌi gegok g oꞌodham ch pi haꞌichu has wua.  
MAT20:4	‘Go and work in the vineyard too, and I'll pay you what's right,’ he told them. So they went to work.  	K hab ha ahg, ‘Nt wo s‑ap em‑namkid mamt wo chikp am ni‑oidag ed.’  
MAT20:5	Around noon and 3 p.m. he went out and did the same thing.  	Kut wa woho am chikpano idam. T hab wa masma hab ep e juh am i gamai gohk ohla ch ed ch waik ohla ch ed. 
MAT20:6	At 5 p.m. he went out and found others standing there. ‘Why are you standing around all day doing nothing?’ he asked them.  	“K am hu d i hetasp ohla. T am hih kahya wui. K am wabsh haꞌi gegok. K hab kaij ab ha wui, ‘Shahchu am ahgch wabsh heki wua g tash pi haꞌichu has wuadch?’ 
MAT20:7	‘Because nobody has hired us,’ they replied. ‘Go and work in the vineyard too,’ he told them. 	“K hab kaij idam, ‘Pi at hedai t‑chikpanach.’ 
MAT20:8	When evening came, the owner of the vineyard told his manager, ‘Call the workers in, and pay them their wages. Begin with the workers hired last and then move on to those hired first.’  	“Neh, t gam hu si i juh. Kut ihda oidag enigakam hab ah g e‑pionag ha‑geꞌejig, ‘Ab g i ha waid g pion k ab wo i ha namkidahi. T hegam wehpeg wo e namkid mant si ha oidch an ha ui k amjed hegam ehp mant ep ha ui k hegam ga hu si ha oidk wo e namkid mant si wehpeg an ha ui.’ 
MAT20:9	When those who were hired at 5 p.m. came in, they each received one denarius.  	“Kut hegam mat gam hu si i juhk chikp mo d i hetasp ohla ab ui g e‑namkidadag haꞌakia mo heꞌekia uꞌu g pion tash ab ch amjed wehs g haꞌi. 
MAT20:10	So when those who were hired first came in, they thought they would get more, but they also received one denarius.  	“Kut ab ha ai hegam mat wabsh i siꞌalim chikp. K hab e ahg mat baꞌich i muꞌi wo ui g e‑namkidadag. Mt wabshaba haꞌakia wa ha namkid.  
MAT20:11	When they received their pay, they complained to the owner.  	T ab ui g e‑lialiga k babgat ab wui g e‑ahmo k ab wui hab kaij,  
MAT20:12	‘Those who were hired last only worked for an hour, and you've paid them the same as us who worked the whole day in the burning heat,’ they grumbled. 	‘Neh, hegam oꞌodham mapt si oidk an ha ui al hemako ohla ab chikp. Kutt ahchim ge tash oidk chikp am s‑toni k ed. Kupt eda am wo haꞌakia t‑namkid mapt hegam.’ 
MAT20:13	The owner answered one of them, ‘My friend, I haven't treated you unfairly. Didn't you agree with me to work for one denarius?  	“K hab kaij g oidag enigakam ab wui hegai mo ha wehhejed neok, ‘Neh, ni‑nawoj, pi ant shaꞌi em‑iattogi namt pi am wa apꞌech mamt haꞌakia k ab wo chikp ni‑wehhejed.

MAT20:17	On the way to Jerusalem, Jesus took the twelve disciples aside as they walked along and told them,  	Am achd i t‑nakog k gam hu hihi. Kud g Jesus am hejelko t‑wai ahchim gamai gohk  
MAT20:18	“Look, we're going to Jerusalem, and the Son of man will be betrayed to the chief priests and religious teachers.

MAT20:23	“You will certainly drink from my cup,” he said to them, “but the privilege to sit on my right or on my left isn't mine to give. My Father is the one who has decided who that will be.  	D hab hahawa ha ahg g Jesus, “Pegih, woho amt ab wo nako hegai hab mahs shoꞌigdag. K wabshaba pi ab hu ni‑ab manis ahni am wo i ha chuhcha mat hedai am ni‑oidch d wo hahaꞌichuk.

MAT21:1	Jesus and his disciples went to Jerusalem. As they were getting close, they came to the village of Bethphage on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two disciples on ahead,  	Kuchd amjed am hihim Jerusalem wui k am ai g Olive Uꞌus Kawulk. D heg mia kihhimag ch hab chehgig Bethphage.

If you said to this mountain, ‘Get up and throw yourself into the sea,’ it would happen!  	D hab kaij g Jesus, “Nt wo si shel em‑ahgi mamt ab wabsh wo hiwgad g Jiosh.

MAT21:33	Here's another illustration. There once was a man, a landowner, who planted a vineyard. He put a fence around it, made a winepress, and built a watchtower. He rented it to some tenant farmers, and then left to go to a different country.  	“Am g hema ep wo kaiham g haꞌichu wepogida,” bad kaij g Jesus. “Neh, matp hems hema g jewed enigakam am wo ei g uhdwis e‑oidag ed.

MAT21:35	But the farmers attacked his servants. They beat one, killed another, and stoned another.  	Kut idam nuhkuddam an ha uꞌu k hema gewittan k hema muꞌa k hema ep maꞌichkwua. 
MAT21:36	So he sent more servants, but the farmers did the same things to them.  	“Kut am hahawa baꞌich i muꞌi ep ha cheha mat am wo hihi. Kut am hihim k am dada. T am hab wa masma hab ep ha juh hegam nuhkuddam. 
MAT21:37	So then he sent his son. ‘They will respect my son,’ he told himself.  	“T g e‑alidag am hahawa ep cheha gam hu si ha oidch no pi hab ha elid mat ab wo wa has el. 
MAT21:38	But the farmers, when they saw the son, said to each other, ‘Here's the heir! Come on! Let's kill him so we can take his inheritance!’  	“T wabshaba idam oidag nuhkuddam am i nei g alidaj k hab kaij ab aꞌai e wui, ‘Id o d enigakam alidag. Oi g wo, tt wo muꞌa k wehs wo bei g enigaj.’  
MAT21:39	They grabbed him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.  	Neh, t wa woho an be k gam hu si i wuhshad ab amjed g uhdwis oidag k mua. 
MAT21:40	When the vineyard owner returns, what will he do to those farmers?” 	“Pegih neh, shaht hig wo ha juh idam g enigakam hekid i jiwiak?” 
MAT21:41	The chief priests and elders said to Jesus, “He will put to death those wicked men in the most awful way, and rent out the vineyard to other farmers who will be sure to give him his fruit at harvest time.” 	D haꞌijj hab kaij hegam, “Hemho wa at wo ha kokda hegam si pi ap chechoj k gam hu baꞌich haꞌijj ab wo ha nuhkudach mat idam ab hi wo mah hegai mo haschu ab d i wuikamaj.” 
MAT21:42	“So haven't you read the Scriptures?” Jesus asked them. “ ‘The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone. The Lord has done this, and it is wonderful in our eyes.’  	D hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Heuꞌu, nat pi s‑ohhod g enigakam alidag. Kumt hab wa masma wo s‑ni‑ohhod.

MAT21:43	That's why I'm telling you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you. It will be given to a people who produce the right kind of fruit.  	“Neh, bo chuꞌig g Jiosh oꞌohana. T g Jiosh wo em‑wohppoꞌi g e‑kownaltalig ahpim Tutuligo k hegam ab wo ha mah mat s‑ap am wo i chikp.

MAT21:45	When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his illustrations, they realized he was speaking about them.  	D hegam uꞌugchu papal ch Palasi s‑mahch mo g Jesus ha wepogid hegam pi ap pion  
MAT21:46	They wanted him arrested, but they were afraid of what the people would do because the people believed he was a prophet. 	ch heg hekaj an chum s‑behim. D wabshaba g hemajkam hab elid mo g Jesus d hema Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam. K hegam uꞌukchu papal s‑ha gihug. 
MAT22:1	Jesus spoke to them using more illustrated stories.  	Jesus ad am hema ep ha ahgid g haꞌichu wepogida am neokch ha wui g hemajkam ch hab kaij,  
MAT22:2	“The kingdom of heaven is like a king who organized a wedding celebration for his son,” Jesus explained.  	“Bant masma am ep wo wepogi g Jiosh kownaltalig matp hems hema g kownal am wo i apꞌech g geꞌe gegosig am wehhejed g e‑alidag nat pi wo ha hohnt.  
MAT22:3	“He sent out his servants to everyone who was invited to the wedding to tell them to come, but they refused.  	T am i e ai. Kut am ha cheha g e‑pionag mat an wo ha ahgidahi hegam mam ab heki hu ha waid. Kut wabshaba idam pi ab hu i hihimim. 
MAT22:4	So he sent out more servants, with the instructions, ‘Tell those who are invited, “I've prepared the wedding banquet. The bulls and fattened calves have been killed—everything's ready. So come to the wedding!” ’ 	“Kut am hahawa haꞌi ep ha cheha g e‑pionag mat an ep wo i ha ahgidahi. K idam an ha ahgidahim ch hab kaij, ‘Heki at hu e chuama g s‑gihgim ch e gagꞌe g wipsilo ch wehs haꞌichu e nahtokch. Kumt ab wo i hihim k wo e gegos.’ 
MAT22:5	But they ignored the invitation and left. One went to his fields; another to take care of his business.  	“T wabshaba idam mam ab ha waid pi ab hu shaꞌi kaiham k gam hu hab wabsh wua g hejel e‑chikpan. Hema at gam hu hih e‑oidag wui. T hema gam hu ep hih e‑tiannaga wui.  
MAT22:6	The rest grabbed the king's servants, mistreated them, and killed them.  	Kut haꞌijj an ha ui idam pion k ha gewittan k ha kokda.  
MAT22:7	The king became furious. He sent his soldiers to destroy those murderers and burn down their town. 	Kut shaꞌi si bagat hegai kownal k am ha cheha g e‑shondalig mat am wo hihim k epai wo ha kokda hegam mat ha kokda g pion k wo mehi g ha‑kihhim. T wa woho hab juh. 
MAT22:8	Then the king said to his servants, ‘The wedding banquet is ready, but those who were invited didn't deserve to attend.  	“T am hahawa i ha wai g e‑pionag k hab kaij, ‘E at nahto g gegosig wehhejed g ni‑alidag hohnta. T wabshaba hegam hemajkam mant ab i chum ha wai hab e juh mo pi d hahawa ha‑wuikam.  
MAT22:9	Go into the streets and invite everyone you find to come to the wedding.’  	Kumt am wo hihi wohg oidk k ab wo i ha wai gegosig wui mamtp heꞌekia i hemajkam wo ha cheh.’ 
MAT22:10	So the servants went out into the streets and brought back everyone they could find, both the good and the bad. The wedding hall was full. 	“Kut am wa woho hihi g piongaj wohg oidk k ab wehs i ha wai hegam mat ha cheh, chum hems g pi ap hemajkam. T am hahawa muꞌi dada. Kumt wehsijj ab ha mah g s‑kehg eniga heg wehhejed k am i ha wahpki. Kut shuhd g kih. 
MAT22:11	But when the king came in to meet the guests, he noticed a man who didn't have a wedding robe on.  	“Kut am i wah g kownal k am ha nei hegam mat am dada. K am hahawa wabsh hema daha g oꞌodham mo pi ab hu wahkch hegai s‑kehg eniga.  
MAT22:12	He asked him, ‘My friend, how did you get in here without a wedding robe?’ The man had nothing to say.  	K ab kakke ch hab kaij, ‘Ni‑nawoj, shahpt masma ia i wah pi ab hu wahkch g s‑kehg eniga id wehhejed?’ 
MAT22:13	Then the king told his servants, ‘Bind his hands and feet, and throw him out into the dark, where there'll be crying and grinding of teeth.’  	Kut ihda kownal am hahawa ha ahgi g e‑pionag k hab kaij, ‘Am g wo si wulshp k gam hu wo daꞌich s‑chuhugam k ed. Kut am hu wo shoak k ga hu wabsh wo i si e kiꞌishch nat pi wo shaꞌi si s‑koꞌok haꞌichu nakogad.’ 
MAT22:14	For many are invited, but few are chosen.” 	“Pegih, nt wo em‑ahgi mo muꞌi ab ha waid g Jiosh. K wabshaba al heꞌekia d i hemajkamgaj.” 
MAT22:15	Then the Pharisees left and met together to plot how they could trap him by what he said.  	Kutsh am i e hemapai g Palasi am i aꞌamich mat has masma wo heki himch g Jesus ab haꞌichu kakkek.  
MAT22:16	They sent their disciples to him, together with some of Herod's supporters. 	Tki am haꞌi i ha wehmt hegam mo ab si has elid g kownal Herod k am ha wehm hihi haꞌi hegam Palasi k am dada k hab kaij, “Ha mashchamdam, s‑mahch ach map s‑ap d oꞌodham ch wabsh chum hedai ha mashcham g Jiosh himdag, chum as has wo chei hedai i.  
MAT22:17	So let us know your opinion. Is it right to pay Caesar's taxes, or not?” 	Pegih, k am wo t‑ahgi maps has elid g geꞌe kownal lial kowlanta. No hig t‑hiwgid g t‑chehanig ahchim Tutuligo matt wo ha namkid aha no pi t‑hiwgid?” 
MAT22:18	Jesus knew their motives were evil. He asked them, “Why are you trying to trap me, you hypocrites?  	D wabshaba g Jesus am wa s‑ha amichud mo g pi apꞌekam hab elid ch hab ha ahg, “Ahpim s‑chu iꞌattomkam am wabsh chum heki s‑ni‑himchudamk.  
MAT22:19	Show me the coin that is used to pay the tax.” They brought a denarius coin to him.  	Ab g wo hema ni‑chehgid hegai lial mam hekaj ha namkid.” 
MAT22:20	“Whose image and whose title is inscribed here?” he asked them. 	D hab ha ahg, “Am g hig wo ni‑ahgid mo hedai wuhiosha ch hedai chehgig ab oꞌohadag id ab lial?” 
MAT22:21	“Caesar's,” they replied. 	D hab kaij idam, “Hegai mo d uhgchu t‑kownalig.” 
MAT22:22	When they heard Jesus' answer they were stunned. They went away and left him. 	Kud si has i el hegam k gam hu hihi ab amjed. 
MAT22:23	Later the same day some Sadducees came to see him. (They are the ones who say there's no resurrection.)  	D heg waꞌi tash ed am haꞌi dada g Sajusi Jesus wui. Hegam mo d Sajusi o pi wohochud mat g muhki ab uhpam wo i wuhsh muhkig t amjed.  
MAT22:24	They asked him, “Teacher, Moses said that if a married  man dies without having children, his brother should marry his widow and have children on behalf of his brother. 	D hab kaij idam, “Ha mashchamdam, Mosesbad atki an oꞌoha hegai chehanigaj g Jiosh mo hab chuꞌig matsh g am oidchkam wehngaj hegai mat wo muh pi ha aꞌalidagkch hemho wo wa bei g hohnigaj g e‑wehnagbad. Tsh g ha‑aꞌaliga hab masma wo e kuint mat d wo aꞌalidajk hegai mat muh. 
MAT22:25	Well, once there were seven brothers here with us. The first married, and died, and since he had no children he left his widow to his brother.  	“Pegih, k am hu hebai wewaꞌak d e‑wepngam ch am t‑wehm kih. Kut g si geꞌechu ge hohnt k pi ab hu ha aꞌalidt k muh k an dagito g e‑hohnig. T g am oidchkam nawojij an hahawa ep bei g hohnigaj  
MAT22:26	The same thing happened to the second and third husband, right up to the seventh.  	k hab waꞌap pi ab hu ha aꞌalidt k hab waꞌap muh. Kut ihda g oidchkam hab waꞌap hohnt k hab waꞌap muh pi ab hu ha aꞌalidtk. Neh, t hab masma i e oi idam wewaꞌak k wehsijj koꞌok huhug.  
MAT22:27	In the end the woman died too.  	K am huꞌi hebai, t haha wabsh muh hab wa ehp ihda uwi.  
MAT22:28	So when the resurrection takes place, whose wife of the seven brothers will she be, for she married all of them?” 	Pegih, am g hig t‑ahgid mas hedai d wo hohnigkad ihda matp ep wo e chegito g koꞌi no pi wehsijj hohnigkahim.” 
MAT22:29	Jesus replied, “Your mistake is you don't know Scripture or what God can do.  	D hab kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Pi am ap chegito nam pi pi shaꞌi mahch g Jiosh oꞌohana ch ep pi shaꞌi mahch mo heꞌes i gewkdag.  
MAT22:30	For in the resurrection people don't marry, and they aren't given in marriage either—they're like the angels in heaven.  	Woho at ab uhpam wo ha mah g koꞌi g doakag. T wabshaba hahawa pi wo hohontad hab masma mo g anghil pi hohont.  
MAT22:31	As for the resurrection of the dead—haven't you read what God said to you,  	Mosesbad atki an oꞌoha mash wa hab kaij g Jiosh: 
MAT22:33	When the crowds heard what he said, they were amazed at his teaching. 	Kud am i kah ihda g hemajkam k si has i el g mashchamaj. 
MAT22:34	When the Pharisees heard that he'd left the Sadducees speechless, they got together and went to ask some more questions.  	Kud am haꞌi dada g Palasi mat wo heki himch g Jesus am i kaiok mat ab si ha chehmo g Sajusi.  
MAT22:35	One of them, who was a legal expert, asked him a question to try to trap him:  	D hema hegam d Jiosh chehanig hudawogdam  
MAT22:36	“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?” 	ch hab kaij, “Ha mashchamdam, shahchu o d si baꞌiwechkim geꞌe chehanigaj g Jiosh?” 
MAT22:37-38	Jesus told them, “ ‘Love the Lord your God in all you think, in all you feel, and in all you do.’ This is the greatest commandment, the first commandment.  	D hab kaij g Jesus, “Id o d si geꞌe ch baꞌich i si s‑has haꞌichu chehanig: 
MAT22:41	While the Pharisees were gathered there, Jesus asked them a question.  	D am i e hemapai g Palasi. D g Jesus hab ha ahg,  
MAT22:42	“What do you think about the Messiah?” he asked. “Whose son is he?” 	“Am g wo ni‑ahgid mam hedai hab elid mat g Jiosh si Kehsha ab d wo amjedkamk?” D hab kaij hegam, “Heg atsh d wo amjedkamk t‑kownaligbad mash hab chehgig David.” 
MAT22:43	“But how can David under inspiration call him ‘Lord’?” Jesus asked them. “He says,  	D hab kaij g Jesus, “Pegih, sh wa eda g Davidbad hab aꞌaga, ‘ni‑kownalig’ ch hab kaij g gewkdajkaj g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag:

MAT23:13	But what a disaster is coming on you, religious teachers and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You slam shut the door of the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You yourselves don't go in, yet you don't let anyone in who is trying to enter.  	D hab hahawa ep kaij g Jesus, “Neh, muꞌijj ahpim chehanig ha mashchamdam ch ahpim Palasi am d wabsh s‑chu iꞌattomkam.

MAT23:15	What a disaster is coming on you, religious teachers and Pharisees, you hypocrites! For you travel over land and sea to make a single convert, and when you do, you make him twice a son of darkness as you are yourselves.  	“Am am si i e nakog mamt chum hems hemako am wo i wanchkwua pi wohokam e‑himdag ed.

You pay a tithe of mint, aniseed, and cumin, but you neglect the vital aspects of the law—doing right, showing mercy, exercising trust. Yes, you should pay your tithe, but don't forget these other things.  	“Im am hu hab wabsh i juhkch hegai mo d chum si haꞌichu am Jiosh chehanig ed mamt hab wabsh wo juhkchid g al chum haꞌichu.

You build tombs as memorials to the prophets, and decorate the tombs of the good,  and you say, ‘If we had lived in the times of our ancestors we would not have joined them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’  But by saying this you testify against yourselves, proving that you belong to those who murdered the prophets!  	“Em‑shohshon at muꞌi ha kokda g kekelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam.

So often I wanted to gather your children as a mother hen gathers her chicks under her wings—but you wouldn't let me.  Now look—your house is left abandoned, totally empty.  	K hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Ih, shoꞌig, ahpim Jerusalem t am hemajkam, nat pi g Jiosh s‑ap wo em‑dagito. Em‑shohshon ash wa ha maꞌichshulig ch muꞌi ha kokda g Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam.

M wabshaba pi ab hu tatchua manis hab wo em‑juh.  
MAT23:39	I tell you this: you won't see me again until you say, ‘Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.’ ” 	K eda an hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed mamt ab wo chum ni‑ihmad ch hab wo chechꞌed mat g Jiosh am ni‑kehsh k si s‑ni‑hoꞌigeꞌid. Kunt ia wo i s‑ap em‑dagito am hugkam mamt hab hahawa masma hab wo e juh.” 
MAT24:1	As Jesus was leaving the Temple his disciples came to him, pointing proudly to the Temple buildings.  	Kud gam hu hahawa i wuhsh g Jesus ab amjed g geꞌe cheopi. Kuchd am i oid k am wui dada k am aꞌaga mo si s‑kehg hab mahs g geꞌe cheopi.  
MAT24:2	But Jesus replied, “You see all these buildings? I tell you the truth: there won't be one stone left upon another. Every last one will come crashing down!” 	D hab kaij, “Heuꞌu, woho o hi wa si s‑kehg hab mahs. Nt wabshaba si shel wo em‑ahgi mo e aihim mat wehs wo i e shul ihda.” 
MAT24:3	As Jesus sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him in private, and asked, “Please tell us when this will happen. What will be the sign of your coming and the end of the world?” 	Kuchd amjed gam hu hejelko hihi wehmaj g Jesus k ab i chehchsh k ab dadhaiwua Olive Uꞌus Kawulk t ab. Kuchd hab ahg g Jesus, “Am g hig t‑ahgid mas hekid hab wo i e juh hegai map am t‑ahgid. Kut haschu d wo chehgidak matt heg ab wo s‑mahchk mo e aihim mapt ep wo jiwia. T g jewed wo huhug.” 
MAT24:4	“Make sure no one misleads you,” Jesus replied.  	D hab kaij g Jesus, “Mt wo si s‑e nenꞌoidad mat pi hedai wo em‑iattogi.  
MAT24:5	“Many will come claiming to be me, saying, ‘I'm the Messiah,’ and they will deceive many people.  	Muꞌi at an wo i wuwha aꞌahidag oidam k ni‑wepo wo e chehcheg hab kaijch mo d Jiosh si Kehsha. Kut muꞌijj ab wo s‑ha wohoch.  
MAT24:6-7	You'll hear about wars, and rumors about wars, but don't be anxious. These things have to happen, but this isn't the end.  Nations will attack other nations, and kingdoms will fight against other kingdoms. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places,  	T g nahnko mahs hemajkam ch jejewed ab aꞌai wo i e checheggia. Mt wabshaba pi wo e totods. Hemho wa at hab wo e juh hab masma. K wabshaba pi hab d ahga mat e ai mat wo kuhgit. Bihugig at wo gehsh k g jewed wo uꞌugij muꞌikpa.  
MAT24:8	but all these things are just the beginnings of birth pains. 	Id at d wabsh wo shohshonajk g shoꞌigdag nat pi baꞌich wo i geꞌeda. 
MAT24:9	Then they will arrest you, they will persecute you, and they will kill you. All people will hate you because of me.  	“T wo e ai mamt am wo em‑uꞌu k wo em‑dagito mamt wo em‑shoꞌigchud k wo em‑kokda. Wehsko jejewed dakam hemajkam at wo s‑em‑kehꞌidad ni‑hekaj.  
MAT24:10	At that time many believers will give up believing. They will betray one another and hate one another.  	Muꞌijj at wo ni‑dagito heg hekaj k wo aꞌai e gagda k wo s‑e kehꞌidad.  
MAT24:11	Many false prophets will come and deceive many people.  	Muꞌi at an wo i wuwha g s‑chu iꞌattomkam k hab wo e aꞌagad mo d Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam. T muꞌi hemajkam ab wo s‑ha wohoch.  
MAT24:12	The increasing evil will lead the love of many to grow cold,  	Pi apꞌekam at wo i geꞌeda. T muꞌijj wo huhug g pihk ha‑elidadag ab aꞌai e wui. 
MAT24:13	but those who hold out to the end will be saved.  	“Mt wo sha e nakog k wo gahi wuwha g e‑shoꞌigdag. T g Jiosh am wo i em‑wahpki e‑kihdag ed.  
MAT24:14	The good news of the kingdom will be proclaimed around the whole world so everyone will be able to hear it, and then the end will come.  	Ihda s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh ab amjed g kownaltaligaj at an wehsko wo e ah jewed dahm. T am haha wo e ai mat wo kuhgit. 
MAT24:15	So when you see the ‘evil that defiles’ standing in the holy place that the prophet Daniel spoke about (those who read this please consider carefully),  	“Am g wo amichud ihda mam in neꞌokchulid. Hegai Danielbad mash d Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam at an oꞌoha mat g em‑obga am wo i kei g s‑uam haꞌichu ged hu si eda g geꞌe cheopi.  
MAT24:16	then the people living in Judea should run away to the mountains.  	Kut hemho wa am wo ahhio dohdaꞌag wui hegam mat hedai ia wo haꞌichugk Judea jewed ch ed.  
MAT24:17-18	Anyone who is on the housetop must not go down and fetch what's in the house.  Anyone who is out in the fields must not go back to get a coat.  	Kut pi hedai am hu wo shaꞌi chum i wah e‑kih ed mat am wo haꞌichu ui, chum as hems imhab wo waꞌi oimmedad e‑kih wehgaj o am wo chikpanad oidag ch ed.  
MAT24:19	How awful it will be for those who are pregnant, and those who are nursing babies at that time!  	S‑ta at ehbidam wo mahsk am ha wehhejed hegam mat wo chuꞌuchum mahmadk ch hegam mat wabsh wo kia woꞌok g ali. 
MAT24:20	Pray that you don't have to run away in winter, or on the Sabbath day.  	“Mt ab wo tahnid g Jiosh mat pi eda hab wo e juh ihda em‑mihshmda tash ed o g s‑hehpichꞌed.  
MAT24:21	For at that time there will be terrible persecution—more terrible than anything that has happened from the beginning of the world up till now, and won't ever happen again.  	Baꞌich at d wo i si geꞌe shoꞌigdagk mo pi hekid g hemajkam shaꞌi neid ch pi hekid hab masma ep wo nei.  
MAT24:22	Unless those days are cut short, nobody will be saved, but for the sake of the chosen those days will be cut short. 	Pi at hedai wo e nako mas am gahi wo wuhsh hegai shoꞌigdag matp tash wo hih. T g Jiosh heg hekaj wo i shopolkai am ha wehhejed g e‑hemajkamga. 
MAT24:23	So if anyone tells you, ‘Look, here's the Messiah,’ or, ‘There he is,’ don't believe it.  	“Pi g wo shaꞌi ha wohochud matp hema hab wo sha chei mo am hebai haꞌichug g Jiosh si Kehsha.  
MAT24:24	For false messiahs will appear, and false prophets too, and they will perform incredible signs and miracles in order to deceive the chosen, if that were possible.  	Muꞌi at in wo i wuwhag k hab wo chei mo d ni‑ahni Jiosh si Kehsha o d Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam k am hab wo wuad g s‑hasig haꞌichu mat hekaj wo i chum ha wanchshul g Jiosh hemajkamga matp wo e nako.  
MAT24:25	Notice that I've told you this before it even happens.  	Neh, ni heki hu am em‑ahgid mamt hekaj wo s‑e nenꞌoidk. 
MAT24:26	So if they tell you, ‘Look, he's out in the desert,’ don't go looking there; or if they say, ‘Look, he's secretly here,’ don't believe it.  	“Tp hems haꞌi hab wo chei mo am haꞌichug g Jiosh si Kehsha tohono jewed ch ed o am hebai e ehstokch. Kumt wabshaba pi wo ha wohochud k pi am hu wo chum hihi.  
MAT24:27	For the coming of the Son of man will be like the lightning that flashes brightly from east to west.  	Wehsko ant wo ni‑chehgi mant hekid ep wo jiwia jewed dahm ahni Jiosh si Kehsha hab sha masma mat g wepgi s‑masma an gahi wo kekiwua chewagi ch ed. 
MAT24:28	‘Vultures gather where the carcass is.’ 	“Neh, s‑mahch am mat hebai wo woꞌok g haꞌichu muhkig an wabsh ha neidch g nunuwi mat am wo e chehm. Pegih, mt hab waꞌap s‑ap wo s‑mahchk mant hebai wo haꞌichugk.” 
MAT24:29	But right after those days of persecution the sun will be darkened, the moon will not shine, the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven will be shaken.  	D hab ep kaij, “T am wabsh wo i chum kuhgi hegai jewed shuhdgim shoꞌigdag. T g tash tonlig wo huhug. T g mashad ep pi wo ha ton. T g dahm kahchim wo ugij. T g huhuꞌu wo i shul.  
MAT24:30	Then the sign of the Son of man will appear in heaven, and all the peoples of the earth will mourn. They will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and in brilliant glory.  	Nt ab haha wo i ni‑chehgi ab dahm kahchim t amjed k wo jiwia. T wehs hemajkam wo si shoanid ab i ni‑neidok. Nt si s‑masma ab wo hudunihi chewagi ch ed. Kut am wo e maskogi g ni‑gewkdag.  
MAT24:31	With a blast from a trumpet he will send his angels to gather his chosen ones from every place, from one end of heaven and earth to the other. 	T ab si s‑kaidam wo e kuhu g kuikud. Kunt wo ha cheha g ni‑anghiliga mat ab wehs wo i ha hemapai hegam mant am i ha chuhcha mat wo e doꞌibia. T am wo hihi imhab siꞌal tahgio ch imhab hudunig tahgio ch imhab wakolim tahgio ch imhab juhpin tahgio k wo ha hemapai.” 
MAT24:32	Learn an illustration from the fig tree. When its shoots become tender and leaves begin to sprout, you know that summer is coming.  	“Nt wo haꞌichu em‑mashcha heg hekaj suhna uhs. Mt wo s‑mahchk mo g toniabkam e aihim mamt wo nei mat ab wo i iꞌiwgi.  
MAT24:33	In the same way when you see all these things happening, you know that his coming is near, in fact it's right at the door!  	Pegih, mt hab waꞌap wo s‑mahchk mo e aihim mat wehs wo kuhgit mamt wo nei mat hab wo e juh hegai mani em‑ahgid.  
MAT24:34	I tell you the truth: this generation won't pass away until all these things have happened.  	Nt wo si shel em‑ahgi mat d wabsh wo kia dodakamk hegam mat wo nei ihda mani em‑ahgid mat hekid wehs wo kuhgit.  
MAT24:35	Heaven and earth may pass away, but my words won't pass away. 	Neh, wehs at gam hu hab wo i e juh ihda Jiosh nahtoi mam in neid. T wabshaba g ni‑neꞌoki pi hekid gam hu hab wo i e juh.” 
MAT24:36	But no one knows the day or hour when this will take place, not the angels in heaven, nor the Son. Only the Father knows.  	D hab ep kaij, “Heg o waꞌi s‑mahch ni‑ohg Jiosh mant hekid ep wo jiwia. Pi o hedai ep s‑mahch, chum hems g anghil nih ahni mani d hi wa chum alidaj.  
MAT24:37	When the Son of man comes it will be like it was during the time of Noah.  	Bat wo masmak haꞌichu mant hekid ep wo jiwia mash wa hab chuꞌig mash eda g Noahbad in d doakam.  
MAT24:38	It will be as in the days before the flood, when they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, right up until the day that Noah went into the Ark.  	Hemajkam ash wa gam hu wabsh i si nenead ch e gegosid ch ihꞌed ch e hohont ch gam hu wabsh i pi chegito g Jiosh. T haha wabsh e ai g tash mat hegam Noahbad am i wahp geꞌe wahlko ch ed.  
MAT24:39	They didn't realize what was going to happen until the flood came and swept them all away. That's how the coming of the Son of man will be. 	Kut wehs ha wiꞌin g hemajkam k ha hugio. Kut hab wo wa masmak mant hekid ep wo jiwia.  
MAT24:40	Two men will be working in the fields. One will be taken, the other left.  	Neh, gohkajj at am wo chikpanad oidag ch ed. T hema gam hu wo i e be k hema am wo wa i e wuiok.  
MAT24:41	Two women will be grinding grain with a mill. One will be taken, the other left.  	Gohk uꞌuwi at am wo haꞌichu chuꞌad. T hema gam hu wo i e be k hema am wo wa i e wuiok. 
MAT24:42	So stay alert, because you don't know what day your Lord is coming.  	“Pegih, mt wo si s‑e nenꞌoidad. Pi o ta machima am em‑wehhejed mant haschu tash ed ep wo jiwia ahni em‑kownalig.  
MAT24:43	But consider this: if the house-owner knew what time a thief was coming, he would keep watch. He would not allow his house to be broken into and robbed.  	Neh, pi o ta machima mas hekid hema wo jiwia g s‑chu ehskam. Kum heg hekaj chum hekid nuhkud g e‑kihdag.  
MAT24:44	You also need to be ready, because the Son of man is coming at a time when you're not expecting him. 	Pegih, k hab waꞌap pi ta machima em‑wehhejed manis hekid wo uhpam jiwia jewed wui ahni Jiosh si Kehsha. Mt heg hekaj wo si e nahtokchid chum hekid. 
MAT24:45	For who is the trustworthy and thoughtful servant? It's the one his master puts in charge of his household to provide them with food at the proper time.  	“Chum amt hedai wo e nahtokch mamtp wo s‑wapagimak ch wo s‑chu aꞌamichudad. S‑mahch am mat g ha‑ahmo hema wo e‑gahgi g hab mahs pion k wo nuhkudach g e‑kihdag. T heg s‑ap wo ha chikpanchudad ch wo ha dagioꞌidad g e‑wehm pion mat eda pi an hu wo haꞌichugk g ha‑ahmo.  
MAT24:46	How good it will be for that servant to be found doing that when his master returns!  	T am ep wo jiwia k wo cheh mo s‑ap am hab junihim g e‑chikpan. Kut d wo si geꞌe s‑hehgigk heg wehhejed pion.  
MAT24:47	I tell you the truth: the master will put that servant in charge over everything he has.  	Nt wo si shel em‑ahgi mat g ahmoj am hahawa wehs dahm wo kei g e‑kihdag. 
MAT24:48	But if he was evil, the servant would say to himself, ‘My master is taking a long time,’  	“T wabshaba pi ap d wo ha kehshak matp hedai hab wo i e ah, ‘Pi at oi wo jiwia g ni‑ahmo,’  
MAT24:49	and would start beating the other servants, feasting and drinking with the drunks.  	k wo i ha shoꞌigch g e‑wehm pion k g s‑iꞌimkam ha wehm wo ihꞌed ch wo e gegosidad.  
MAT24:50	Then that servant's master will return when the man doesn't expect him, at a time he doesn't know.  	T haha wabsh wo jiwia g ahmoj k wo cheh mo pi ap hab wua g e‑chikpan  
MAT24:51	He'll cut him to pieces, and treat him in the same way as the hypocrites, sending him to a place where there's crying and gnashing of teeth. 	k wo si s‑koꞌokam namkid k gam hu hab wo i juh. Neh, bat wa masma hab wo e juh ha wehhejed hegam mat pi ab hu wo wohog elidad g Jiosh. Heg at s‑koꞌokam wo ha namkid. Kut heg hekaj wo shoakad ch ga hu wabsh wo i si e kiꞌishch.” 
MAT25:1	The kingdom of heaven is like ten girls, who took their lamps with them to go and meet the bridegroom.  	D hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Baꞌich ant am wo i em‑tashogi g Jiosh kownaltalig am wepogidch hegai kih mat hebai haꞌi wo e hohont. Mt am haꞌi ha wai wehst‑mahm chetcha. T am hihi ha uꞌadch g e‑lalampa k am wo i wahp g wo ha hohntam wehm mat hekid wo jiwia.  
MAT25:2	Five were foolish, and five were wise.  	Hetasp idam o pi haꞌichu nenꞌoid  
MAT25:3	The foolish girls took their lamps but didn't take any oil with them,  	ch ep pi ha waꞌigchug g a‑saidi.  
MAT25:4	while the wise took jars of oil with them as well as their lamps.  	Hetasp o s‑chu nenꞌoid ch ep ha waꞌigchug g a‑saidi.  
MAT25:5	The bridegroom took a long time and all the girls became drowsy and fell asleep.  	Kut pi oi jiwia g wo ha hohntam. T wehsijj s‑ha kohksimch idam chetcha. T gam hu kohk. 
MAT25:6	At midnight the shout came, ‘Look, the bridegroom's here! Come out and meet him!’  	“Neh, t am i e ai g eda hugkam g s‑chuhugam. T ab kaida ihda, ‘Ab o him g wo ha hohntam. Oi g wo i hihim k ab wo namkhi.’  
MAT25:7	All the girls got up and trimmed the wicks of their lamps. The foolish girls said to the wise ones,  	T hegam wehst‑mahm chetcha nehnen k i ha kegchud g e‑lalampa. 
MAT25:8	‘Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are going out.’ But the wise girls replied,  	“K hab kaij hegam mo pi haꞌichu nenꞌoid, ‘Ab g wo i ha t‑mahki g e‑a‑saidiga. Chuhchkim o g t‑lalampa.’ 
MAT25:9	‘No, because otherwise there won't be enough for both you and for us. Go to the shopkeepers and buy some oil for yourselves.’  	“K hab kaij hegam mo s‑chu nenꞌoid, ‘Pi att wo t‑nako. Am o wabsh i hejel t‑wehhejed ahim am shuhdagi ch pi wo em‑ai. Am amt wo hihi tianna wui k am hejel wo ha nolawt.’ 
MAT25:10	While they went to buy oil, the bridegroom arrived, and those who were ready went in with him to the wedding, and the door was locked shut.  	“T wa woho hab e juh hegam haꞌi k gam hu hihi mat wo ha nolawt g a‑saidi. Kut eda ia hu ha oidk jiwia g wo ha hohntam. Kut hegam hetasp mo e nahtokch gam hu wehmaj i wahp mat am wo e gegos wehmaj. T ab si e kuh g kihjeg. 
MAT25:11	The other girls came later. ‘Lord, Lord,’ they called, ‘Open the door for us!’  	“T am i uhpam dada hegam haꞌi k ab chum shoani ch hab kaij, ‘Ab g si s‑t‑hoꞌigeꞌid k ab i kuhpiꞌoki matt am wo i wahp.’ 
MAT25:12	But he answered, ‘I tell you the truth: I don't know you.’  	‘Nt wo si shel em‑ahgi mani pi shaꞌi em‑mahch mams hedai wud,’ ch am hahawa si kuh g kihjeg.” 
MAT25:13	So stay alert, for you don't know the day, or the hour. 	Neh, d am i kuhgit g e‑wepogida g Jesus hab kaijch, “Neh, mt wo s‑e nenꞌoidad nam pi pi shaꞌi mahch mant hekid ep wo jiwia. 
MAT25:14	It's like a man who went away on a trip. He called in his servants and entrusted them with what he owned.  	“Bant masma ep wo i wepogi g Jiosh kownaltalig matp hems g oꞌodham hema hasko wo him k ab i ha wai g e‑pionag mat ab wo ha nuhkudach g haꞌichu e‑eniga.  
MAT25:15	To one of them he gave five talents, to another he gave two, and to another one, according to their different abilities. Then he left.  	Hema at mah g hetasp mihl pihsh k hema gohk mihl pihsh k hema ep g hemako mihl pihsh no pi s‑mahch mat heꞌekia i s‑ap wo chikpanad k amjed gam hu mehk jewed wui hih. 
MAT25:16	Immediately the one with five talents went and invested them in a business, and made another five talents.  	“Hegai piongaj mat g hetasp mihl pihsh ab ui at am ha hekaj i e nakog k hekaj ihda lial mat am dahm hetasp mihl pihsh ep nahto.  
MAT25:17	In the same way the one with two talents made another two.  	Kut hegai mat g gohk mihl pihsh ab ui hab waꞌap e juh k gohk mihl pihsh am dahm nahto.  
MAT25:18	But the man who'd received the one talent went off and dug a hole and hid his master's money.  	T wabshaba hegai mat g hemako mihl pihsh ab ui gam hu him k am hebai wagt k am ehsto. 
MAT25:19	A long time later the master of those servants returned, and settled accounts with them.  	“K mehk amjed mat jiwia g ha‑ahmo idam k am ha ui mat wo s‑mai mat has masma hekaj g lialigaj. 
MAT25:20	The one with five talents came and presented the other five talents. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘You gave me five talents. Look, I've made a profit of five talents.’  	“Hegai piongaj mat g hetasp mihl pihsh ab ui at ab i wah k ab i mah g hetasp mihl pihsh am dahm hegai mat ab ui k hab kaij, ‘Ab apt wa ni‑mah g hetasp mihl pihsh. Neh, nt am baꞌich hetasp mihl pihsh ab ep wo m‑mah mant nahto.’ 
MAT25:21	His master said to him, ‘You've done well—you are a good, faithful servant. You have proved yourself trustworthy over small things, so now I'm placing you in charge over many things. Be happy because I'm really pleased with you!’  	“K hab kaij g ahmoj, ‘S‑ap aptki hab e juh, s‑apꞌekam ni‑pionag, s‑ap hekajk mant heꞌekia ab i m‑mah. Nt hekaj ab baꞌich i muꞌi wo m‑nuhkudach. Am g ni‑wehm s‑hehgigkad.’ 
MAT25:22	The one with two talents also came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘You gave me two talents. Look, I've made a profit of two talents.’  	“T heg ab hahawa ep i wah piongaj mat g gohk mihl pihsh ab mah k hab kaij, ‘Neh, gohk mihl pihsh apt wa ab ni‑mah. Kunt am baꞌich gohk mihl pihsh ab ep wo m‑mah mant nahto.’ 
MAT25:23	His master said to him, ‘You've done well—you are a good, faithful servant. You have proved trustworthy over small things, so now I'm placing you in charge over many things. Be happy because I'm really pleased with you!’ 	“K hab kaij g ahmoj, ‘S‑ap aptki hab e juh, s‑apꞌekam ni‑pionag, s‑ap hekajk mant heꞌekia ab i m‑mah. Nt hekaj ab baꞌich i muꞌi wo m‑nuhkudach. Am g ni‑wehm s‑hehgigkad.’ 
MAT25:24	Then the man with one talent came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘I know that you're a hard man. You reap where you didn't sow, and you harvest crops that you didn't plant.  	“T ab hahawa i wah hegai piongaj mat g hemako mihl pihsh ab mah k hab kaij, ‘Ni‑ahmo, s‑mahch ani map s‑ta keꞌidama ch s‑beihimk hegai map haschu pi ab hu chikpan.  
MAT25:25	So since I was afraid of you I went and buried your talent in the ground. Look, you can have back what belongs to you.’  	Kunt heg hekaj gam hu s‑aꞌagko eꞌesto g m‑lialiga. Neh, m ia wehch mo haschu d m‑eniga.’ 
MAT25:26	But his master answered him, ‘You wicked and lazy servant! If you think I reap where I don't sow, and harvest crops I didn't plant,  	“K hab kaij g ahmoj, ‘Si pi ap ch s‑padmakam ni‑pionag, kups wa chum s‑mahch mani s‑ta keꞌidama ch s‑beihimk hegai mani haschu pi ab hu chikpan.  
MAT25:27	then you should have deposited my silver in the bank so that when I returned I could have had my money with interest.  	Pegih neh, pt hems am hi wo wa chum toa g ni‑lialiga wahnko ch ed. Kunt ab wehs uhpam wo ui wehnadk mat haschu ab wo i mahmadt.’ 
MAT25:28	Take the talent away from him, and give it to the one with ten talents.  	“K hab hahawa ha ahg g haꞌi ep e‑pionag, ‘Mt wo wohppoꞌid k ab wo mah hegai mo wehst‑mahm mihl pihsh edgid.  
MAT25:29	For everyone who has will be given even more; and everyone who doesn't have anything, even what they have will be taken away from them.  	Baꞌich at ep wo nei g e‑apꞌedag hegam mat hedai s‑ap wo hekaj. T wabshaba wo e wohppoꞌidach mo haschu al i edgid hegam mat pi ap wo hekaj.

MAT25:31	But when the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his majestic throne.  	“An ant wo dahiwua ni‑kownal daikud an mant hekid wo i jiwia ha wehm g ni‑anghiliga.  
MAT25:32-33	Everyone will be brought before him. He will separate them from one another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.  He'll place the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left.  	T wehs hemajkam am wo e hemapai ni‑baꞌich. Nt ab wo i ha gawulkai hegam mo d wohokam ab ha amjed hegam mo pi d wohokam hab masma mamt am wo i ha gawulkai g kahwal ch siswat.  
MAT25:34-36	Then the king will say to the ones on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, and inherit the kingdom that's been prepared for you from the beginning of the world.  For I was hungry, and you gave me food to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me a drink. I was a stranger and you invited me in.  I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you looked after me. I was in prison and you visited me.’  	Bant wo ha ahgi hegam mant ab i ha gawulkai, ‘Ab g wo i hihim. S‑em‑hoꞌigeꞌid o g Jiosh.

K g Jiosh am nahtokch g kihdag em‑wehhejed ga hu i amjed mat in i nahto g jewed. Ab g wo i wahpkid k wo edagi.’ 
MAT25:37-39	Then those who are right will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and fed you, or thirsty and gave you a drink?

MAT26:51	One of those who was with Jesus reached for his sword and pulled it out. He struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.  	Kud hema g t‑wehm e mashchamdam am i wuhshad g e‑is‑pahyo k ab si gehg g neholigaj g uhgchu pahl k an si hikuch g nahkaj.

MAT26:55	Then Jesus told the mob, “Have you come with swords and clubs to arrest me as if I was some kind of dangerous criminal? Every day I sat in the Temple teaching and you didn't arrest me then.  	Neh, bad kaij g Jesus ch hab hahawa ha ahg hegam mat an bei, “Wehs tashkaj ani am dahiwup ch ha mashcham geꞌe cheopi t am.

MAT27:24	When Pilate saw it was a lost cause, and that a riot was developing, he took some water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. “I'm innocent of this man's blood.

MAT27:64	Give orders to secure the tomb until the third day.

MRK01:19	He went a little farther and saw James and his brother John, the sons of Zebedee. They were in a boat mending their nets.  	Tsh am shaꞌi hihim k haha wabsh gohk ep ha cheh. Idam ash am kegchud g e‑chuagia wahlko ch ed ch d James ch John. Kush g ohgaj hab chehgig Zebedee.

MRK01:23	Suddenly, right there in the synagogue, a man with an evil spirit started shouting out,  	Kush eda am hema haꞌichug g oꞌodham mash g jiawul uꞌukch g chegitoidaj.  
MRK01:24	“Jesus of Nazareth, why are you bothering us? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are!

MRK01:26	The evil spirit screamed, threw the man into convulsions, and came out of him. 	Tsh g jiawul si ugij ihda oꞌodham. Kutsh si hihin. Tsh g jiawul hahawa dagito. 
MRK01:27	Everyone was amazed at what happened. “What is this?” they asked each other. “What is this new teaching that has such authority? Even evil spirits do what he tells them!”  	Kutsh wehsijj si e totodsid k ab aꞌai i e kakke, “Shahꞌo d ahga ihda? No d wechij mashchama? No pi ab kaiham g jijawul mo haschu ab i ha chehani.” 
MRK01:28	News about him spread quickly throughout the whole region of Galilee. 	Kutsh an wehsko i e ahgidahi am Galilee ch ed matsh haschu s‑kehg hab juh g Jesus. 
MRK01:29	Then they left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John.  	Kutsh ab i wuwha hegam Jesus cheopi t amjed k gam hu wa hekaj hihi ha‑kih wui hegam Simon ch Andrew. Tsh g James ch John ep i ha oi.

MRK01:31	He went to her, took her by the hand, and helped her up. The fever immediately left her. Then she made them a meal. 	Tsh am i wah mo hebai woꞌo k ab bei nowij ab k i wamigi. Kutsh ha hekaj am i apꞌet k am haꞌichu ha hihidol.

MRK01:33	The whole of the town gathered outside.  	k am i e hemapai ha‑kih ab.  
MRK01:34	He healed many people who had various diseases, and threw out many demons. He did not permit the demons to speak, for they knew who he was.

MRK01:36	Simon and the others went to search for him.  	Kutsh idam Simon am i gahghio.  
MRK01:37	When they found him, they told him, “Everybody's looking for you.” 	k am hebai chehg k am ahgid, “Muꞌi hemajkam o an m‑gahg.” 
MRK01:38	But Jesus replied, “We have to go to the other towns around here so that I can tell them the good news as well—for that's why I came.” 	Kush hab kaij g Jesus, “Oi g wo. Tt hig wo hihi am baꞌich kihhim wui. Nt am ep wo ha mihshmad nant pi heg hekaj i wuhsh.”

MRK01:40	A leper came to him asking for help. The man kneeled down before Jesus, saying, “Please, if you're willing, you can heal me!”  	Sh am hu hebai, tsh am hema jiwia Jesus wui k mumku heg hekaj mo hab e aꞌaga ‘leprosy’ ch chum pi ha doajig.

MRK01:41	With compassion Jesus reached out and touched the man, and said, “I am willing. Be healed!” 	Kutsh ab si i s‑hoꞌigeꞌid k ab taht k hab ahg, “Mant hab wo wa m‑juni.”  
MRK01:42	The leprosy left him immediately, and he was healed.  	Kutsh ha hekaj doa. 
MRK01:43-44	Jesus sent him away with a strong warning.  “Make sure you don't tell anybody anything about this,” he told him. “Go to the priest and show yourself to him. Give the offering which is required by the law of Moses for such cleansing, so that people will have proof.” 	Jesus atsh am hahawa si shel ahgid k hab kaij, “Pi g hedai shaꞌi ahgid k wabsh am wo him k am wo i e chehgi pahl wui.

MRK01:45	But the healed leper went out and told everyone what had happened. As a result Jesus could not openly go into the cities anymore, but had to stay out in the country where people came to him from everywhere around. 	Kutsh oi wa ihda oꞌodham wehsko i ha ahgidahi g hemajkam ab amjed. Tsh heg hekaj pi e nako g Jesus mas am ep wo i wuhsh mo am hemajkamag kihhim ch ed k wabshaba gan hu hab wabsh jegko oimmed.

MRK02:4	but they could not get near Jesus because of the crowds. So they went up on the roof and took it apart. After they had made an opening above Jesus, they lowered down the mat with the paralyzed man lying on it. 	Sh wabshaba pi am hu shaꞌi jeg nash pi shaꞌi si s‑hemajkamag. Kutsh gan hu i chehchsh kih dahm k am ge maggat g kih maꞌishpadag am hu i mash am daha g Jesus k am i huduni g pi himidkam.

MRK02:6	Some of the religious teachers sitting there thought to themselves,  	Kush eda am haꞌi dadha hegam mo d chehanig ha mashchamdam ch ash hab e ahg,  
MRK02:7	“Why is he talking like this? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins? Only God can do that!” 	“Ih, pi oki ap neok hab masma e wepogidch g Jiosh. Heg at waꞌi Jiosh wo e nako mat gam hu hab wo i juh g pi ap ha‑chuꞌijig.” 
MRK02:8	Jesus knew right away what they were thinking. He said to them, “Why are you thinking like this?  	Kutsh ha hekaj ha amich g Jesus mo haschu am oidahim k hab kaij ab ha wui, “Pi g am wo shaꞌi oidahim

MRK02:12	He stood up, picked up his mat, and walked out in front of everyone there. They were all amazed, and praised God, saying “We've never ever seen anything like this!” 	Kutsh am ha hekaj bei g e‑wahkus k gam hu hih uhpam am wehs ha‑nena ed.

MRK02:15-16	That evening Jesus ate dinner at Levi's house. Many tax collectors and “sinners” joined Jesus and his disciples for the meal, for there were many of these people that followed Jesus. When the religious leaders of the Pharisees saw Jesus eating with such people, they asked Jesus' disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?” 	Tsh am hu hebai i cheka. Kutsh g Levi am hab juh g gegosig ha wehhejed hegam Jesus. Kush am dadhak ch e gegosid. Sh am haꞌi oiopo hegam mo d t‑chehanig t‑mashchamdam ch d ep Palasi.

MRK02:17	When Jesus heard this, he told them, “It's not healthy people who need a doctor, but those who are sick. I haven't come to invite those who do what is right, but those who don't—the sinners.” 	Tsh am i ha kaiok g Jesus k hab kaij ab ha wui, “Idam pi ap hemajkam o s‑e doꞌibiamk hab masma mat g kokꞌodam wo s‑e doajidam.

MRK02:18	Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some of them came to Jesus, and asked him, “Why is it that John's disciples and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don't?” 	Hebaichuj ach heꞌekkio pi t‑gegosid matt ab wo t‑hoꞌigeꞌidahu Jiosh wui. Kutsh am hu hebai am i e ai matsh hab wo chum e juh. Sh eda idam Jesus pi hab e wua.

MRK03:4	“Is it lawful to do good on the Sabbath, or to do evil? Should you save life, or should you kill?” he asked them. But they didn't say a word.

MRK03:13-14	Then Jesus went away to the hill country. He called those he wanted to be with him, and they came to him.  He chose twelve to be with him, and called them apostles. They were to be with him, and he would send them out to announce the good news,  	Tsh am hu hebai, tsh ab i chesh g Jesus kawulk t ab k ab i wai hegam mash ab s‑wohochud. Tsh ab wui i hihi.

MRK03:35	Whoever does what God wants, they are my brother, and sister, and mother.” 	Hegam mat hab wo junihid g Jiosh tatchui o hab a masma mo d ni‑wepnag ch ni‑jeꞌe.” 
MRK04:1	Jesus began teaching beside the Sea again. So many people came to listen to him that he climbed into a boat and sat in it on the water while the crowd listened from the shore.  	Sh am hu i hebai, sh g Jesus am ep ha mihshmad ge shuhdagi hugid an. Kush shaꞌi si muꞌi hemajkam an wehgaj. Tsh heg hekaj gan hu i chesh g Jesus wahlko ch ed k an dahiwua k amjed ha mashcham.

MRK04:2	He illustrated his teachings using many stories. 	Kush muꞌi haꞌichu ha tashogid g wepogida ahgakaj ab amjed g Jiosh kownaltalig. 
MRK04:3	“Listen,” he said. “A sower went out to sow.  	Id ash d haꞌichu ahgaj mo hab kaij: 
MRK04:4	Now as he was scattering the seeds, some fell on the path, and birds came and ate them up.  	T haꞌi gan hu wabsh shul wohg ch ed. T g uꞌuwhig am dada k koꞌito.  
MRK04:5	Other seeds fell on stony ground where there wasn't much earth. In the shallow soil the plants started growing quickly, but because the soil wasn't deep  	Kut haꞌi gan hu wabsh shul waw t ab mo pi geꞌej g jewed k ab ha hekaj hi wa chum i wuhsh no pi pi an hu juhk g jewed.

MRK04:7	Other seeds fell among thorns. The thorns grew up and choked the sprouting seeds, so they produced nothing.  	T haꞌi gan hu wabsh ep shul shaꞌi ch ed. T oi wa hekid ab i geꞌege g shaꞌi k wabsh ha kokda. T pi ab hu ha kait.  
MRK04:8	Other seeds fell on good soil where they sprouted and grew. They produced a harvest of some thirty, some sixty, and some a hundred times what was planted.

MRK04:9	If you have ears to hear, listen to what I'm saying.” 	Neh, am g wo i oidahim ahpim mam kah ihda.” 
MRK04:10	When he was by himself, his twelve disciples and the others who were with him asked him what the illustrations meant. 	Neh, bash kaij g Jesus ch amjed am hahawa i e hejelkai. Kutsh ab wui i hihi g chuhchaij haꞌi ep ha wehm k ab kakke, “A tt has masma wo s‑ha amich g haꞌichu wepogida ahga?” 
MRK04:11	He told them, “The mystery of God's kingdom has been given to you to understand. But outsiders only have the stories,  	Kush hab kaij ab ha wui, “Nt wo em‑ahgi mo has d ahga no pi g Jiosh em‑hiwgid mamt wo s‑mai hegai mo hemu am maskogid ab amjed g e‑kownaltalig. Ni wabshaba heg waꞌi ha ahgid haꞌichu wepogida ahga hegam mo pi ab hu wohochudamk. 
MRK04:13	“Don't you understand this story?” Jesus asked them. “If you can't, how are you going to understand all the other stories? 	Kush hab ha ahg g Jesus, “Muꞌi ani haꞌichu chum em‑ahgid g haꞌichu wepogida ahgakaj. Kumki eda pi amichud. Nt hemho am wo wa em‑tashogi. 
MRK04:14	The sower sows the word. 	“Hegai haꞌichu eshdam ani wepogid hegai mat an wo ahgachugad g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. K g kaichkaj d Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. Id at am wo chum e ei oꞌodham amichudadag ed.  
MRK04:15	The seeds on the path where the word is sown illustrate those who hear the message, but then Satan immediately comes along and takes away the word that's been sown in them.  	K eda haꞌi g ha‑iꞌibdag s‑kawpk hab masma mo g wohg. T g Jiawul am wabsh s‑pehegi wo ha wohppoꞌi mo haschu i kah. 
MRK04:16	Likewise the seeds on the rocky ground illustrate those who hear the word, and happily accept it right away.  	“K haꞌi g ha‑iꞌibdag hab sha masma mo hebai pi geꞌej g jewed ab waw t ab. T idam wo si s‑hohhoꞌi Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ab kaiok k wabshaba pi wihnam ab hu wo bebhe k ch ab hi wa al heꞌes wo s‑wohochudad.  
MRK04:17	But since they have no real roots, they only last for a while until trouble or persecution comes, and then they quickly fall away.  	T ab wabsh wo i chum hih g aꞌappema. T ha hekaj wabsh wo taꞌi i shul. 
MRK04:18	Those sown among the thorns illustrate those who hear the word,  	“K haꞌi g ha‑iꞌibdag hab sha masma mo hebai s‑shaꞌig  
MRK04:19	but worries of this world, the temptation of wealth, and other distractions choke the growth of the word, and it becomes unproductive.  	no pi e shaꞌijidch heg hekaj kudutadag ch s‑kaisdag ch s‑tahhadkam. Kut pi haꞌichu hab wo juh am Jiosh wehhejed. 
MRK04:20	But the seeds sown on good soil illustrate those who hear the word, accept it, and are productive—producing thirty, sixty, and hundred times what was originally sown. 	“K haꞌi g ha‑iꞌibdag s‑moik hab masma mo g moihuna. Kut ab wo kaiha g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga k am wo si i nuhkud e‑ihbdag ed k gam hu wo i ha ahgidahi g hemajkam k haꞌakia ab wo waꞌi ep ha baꞌiha, Haꞌi atp hems waikko wehst‑mahm wo i ha baꞌiha k haꞌi chuhdpo wehst‑mahm k haꞌi siant ab ep wo i ha baꞌiha.” 
MRK04:21	Who puts a lamp under a bucket, or beneath a bed?” Jesus asked them. “No, you put a lamp up on a lamp-stand.  	Kush hab hahawa ep kaij am ha wui, “Wohokam o wepogidas mo g lahmpa tonlig. Namt hig wo ehsto g lahmpa ab mehidk aha namt an wo dai mat hebai wo em‑tonlidch. Pegih, mt hab wa masma pi wo chum ehsto g wohokam.

MRK04:23	If you have ears to hear, listen to what I'm saying!  	Am g wo i oidahim ahpim mam kah ihda.” 
MRK04:24	Pay attention to what you're hearing,” he told them, “for you will be given according to how much you want to receive, measure for measure.  	Sh hab ep kaij am ha wui, “Am g wo s‑amichud mam haschu i kah. Mamt has i masma s‑baꞌama ab wo haꞌichu ha mah hedai i, t hab masma ab uhpam wo i e nodagi haꞌichu ab em‑wui ch atp hems gam hu baꞌich i.  
MRK04:25	More will be given to those who already have understanding, but those who don't want to know will have what little understanding they have taken from them. 	Hegam mat s‑ap wo hekaj g e‑apꞌedag at baꞌich ep wo i nei. T hegam mat pi ap wo hekaj wabsh wo heb hu wua.” 
MRK04:26	God's kingdom is like a man sowing seed in the ground,” Jesus said.  	Sh hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Jiosh kownaltalig o heg wepogidas matp hems g oꞌodham am gantad g haꞌichu kai e‑oid ed.  
MRK04:27	“He goes to bed and gets up, day after day, but the man has no knowledge of how the seeds sprout and grow.  	k am haha wabsh nenida heꞌekia i tash. T g eshaj am i wuhshani k hahhagt k ab hahawa mudadagt k ab kait. K eda pi mahch g oꞌodham mo has masma hab e wua

MRK04:29	When the grain is ripe, the farmer reaps it with a sickle, because the harvest is ready. 	T am wabsh i chum bai. Kut am ha hekaj ha cheha g e‑chikpandam mat wo hihk k wo i baꞌiha.” 
MRK04:30	What can we compare God's kingdom to? What illustration shall we use?” he asked.  	Kush hab ep kaij, “Am ant baꞌich wo i em‑tashogi g Jiosh kownaltalig am wepogidch g haꞌichu kai.  
MRK04:31	“It's like a mustard seed, the tiniest seed of all.  	Neh, heg am eꞌesha mo al chumaj  
MRK04:32	But when it's sown it grows into a plant that's larger than other plants. It has branches big enough that birds can roost in its shade.” 	ch oi wa am wo wuhshani k haꞌas wo i geꞌeda mo g s‑ehheg uhs. Tp hems heg ab an wo koksht g uꞌuwhig. Pegih, t hab wa masma wo geꞌe i geꞌeda g Jiosh kownaltalig, chum as al chum wo shonwua.” 
MRK04:33	Jesus used many of these illustrated stories when he spoke to the people so they would understand as much as they could.  	Neh, bash masma heg waꞌi hekaj am ha mihshmad wepogida ahga mat heꞌes wo i s‑amich.  
MRK04:34	In fact, when he spoke publicly, he only used stories; however in private he explained everything to his disciples. 	Tsh gam hu wo hihi g hemajkam. Kutsh am haha wabsh baꞌich wo i ha tashogi g e‑chuhchai g haꞌichu e‑ahga. 
MRK04:35	Later that day, in the evening, he said to his disciples, “Let's go across to the other side of the Sea.”  	Tsh gam hu si i juh. Sh hab ha ahg g Jesus, “Oi g wo. Ga att hu shuhdagi aigojed wo i chehchsh.” 
MRK04:36	Leaving the crowd behind, the disciples went with Jesus and got into a boat. Other boats went with them.  	Kutsh am i ha dagito g hemajkam k ab i chehchsh wahlko ch ed wehmaj g Jesus. Kutsh eda am haꞌi ep chum i ha oi g al wapalko.

MRK04:38	Jesus was asleep in the stern, resting his head on a cushion. The disciples woke him up, shouting at him, “Teacher, don't you care that we're about to drown?” 	Sh eda am woꞌok ch kohsh g Jesus si baikko g wahlko. Kutsh am wuha g chuhchaij k hab ahg, “Nap pi has shaꞌi elid mattki wo wachkk.” 
MRK04:39	Jesus woke up. He told the wind to die down and told the waves, “Be quiet! Be still.” The wind stopped, and the water became completely calm.  	Tsh am hahawa wamig k ab si wui neo g hewel ch shuhdagi k hab ahg, “Am g wabsh i dodolimat k haꞌasa i hewed.” Kutsh ab wabsh si heweto k g shuhdagi gam hu wabsh i pi hoini.

MRK04:41	They were stunned and terrified. They asked each other, “Who <span class="it">is</span> this? Even the wind and the waves obey him!” 	Kutsh eda si s‑ehbeni k wabsh ab aꞌai i e kakke, “A kus hedai wud ihda oꞌodham mat g hewel ch shuhdagi ab kaiha.” 
MRK05:1	They arrived on the other side of the lake in the region of the Gerasenes.  	Kutsh gam hu dada miabidch mo am d Gerasa kihhim. 
MRK05:2	When Jesus got out of the boat a man with an evil spirit came from the graveyard to meet him.  	Tsh ab wabsh i chum hud g Jesus wahlko t amjed. Kutsh ab hema nam g cheoj mash ab e ulish cheo ch ed mash eda ab d hihaꞌini.  
MRK05:3	This man lived among the tombs, and it had been impossible to tie him up any more, even with a chain.  	Sh g jijawul an uꞌukch ihda. Kush pi hedai e nakog mas wo mahshoch.  
MRK05:4	He had often been tied up with chains and shackles, but he simply tore the chains apart and broke the shackles into pieces. No one had the strength to subdue him.

MRK05:6	Seeing Jesus from a distance he ran and kneeled in front of him.  	Tsh am jiwia g Jesus. Kutsh mehkjed chehg k am med k ab i gei wui.  
MRK05:7	In a loud voice he cried out, “What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of Almighty God? Swear by God that you won't torture me!”  	k am si s‑kaidam neok k hab ahg, “Ni‑dagitoni, ahpi alidaj g si Jiosh. Bani m‑ahgid ab si ihmch g Jiosh mapt pi ia hu wo ni‑hudawogad.”  
MRK05:8	For Jesus had already told the evil spirit to leave the man. 	Bash kaij nash pi g Jesus ab i s‑wuhshdamk g jiawul id amjed oꞌodham. 
MRK05:9	Then Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” 	Sh g Jesus ab hahawa kakke, “Shahp chehgig?” 
MRK05:10	He also repeatedly pleaded with Jesus not to send them a long way away. 	ch ab wui si e shoꞌigchud mat pi mehk gam hu hab wo i ha juh hegam jijawul mo an uꞌukch. 
MRK05:11	A large herd of pigs was feeding on the hillside nearby.  	Kush eda inhab shaꞌi si muꞌi kokji e nuhkud kawulk huda.  
MRK05:12	The evil spirits pleaded with him, “Send us into the pigs so we can enter them.”  	Kutsh g jijawul ab si tahni g Jesus, “Am g hig t‑hiwgid matt am wo i wahp ha eda hegam kokji.” 
MRK05:13	Jesus allowed them to do this. The evil spirits left the man and went into the pigs. The whole herd, about two thousand, rushed down the steep cliff into the sea and drowned.  	Kutsh ha hiwigi. Kutsh ab i wuwha heg amjed oꞌodham k gam hu hihim k am i wahp ha eda hegam kokji.

MRK05:15	When they found Jesus they saw the man who had been demon-possessed sitting there, dressed, and in his right mind—the one who had the legion of evil spirits—and they became frightened!  	k am hu dada. Kush am dak ch e enigadadch ch ash wabsh s‑apꞌe. Kutsh wehsijj si e totods. 
MRK05:16	Then those who had seen what had happened to the man who had been demon-possessed and the pigs told the others.  	Hegam mash am neid atsh an i ha ahgidahi mat has e juh hegai mo g jijawul an uꞌukch k am ep ha ahgi mat has e juh g kokji.  
MRK05:17	They began pleading with Jesus to leave their district.  	Kutsh ab wabsh si s‑bahbagi i ahgi g Jesus g hemajkam, “Mapt gam hig wo i e mehkod ab t‑amjed.” 
MRK05:18	As Jesus climbed into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him.  	Kush g Jesus an cheshajhim wahlko ch ed. Tsh ihda oꞌodham mash g jijawul uꞌukch ab chum ahgi, “Nt wo m‑oi.” 
MRK05:19	But Jesus refused, telling him, “Go home to your own people, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how he has been merciful to you.” 	Kutsh oi wa pi hiwgid k ash hab wabsh ahg, “Pt wabsh wo wa hih am e‑kih wui k wo ha ahgi g e‑nanꞌaipijju mat haschu si s‑kehg hab m‑juni g Jiosh.” 
MRK05:20	So the man went on his way and began to tell the people of the Ten Cities everything Jesus had done for him, and everyone was amazed.

MRK05:22	A synagogue leader, a man named Jairus, came to him. When he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet  	Tsh ab hema i hih g oꞌodham k d haꞌichu amai ha‑cheopi ed ch hab chehgig Jairus. Tsh ab i hud g Jesus. Kutsh ab wui i gehsh

MRK05:24	So Jesus went with him. Everybody followed, crowding and jostling him.  	Kutsh am i chum hih matsh wo oi ihda oꞌodham.

MRK05:27	She had heard about Jesus, so she came up behind him through the crowd, and touched his cloak.  	Sh am hahawa i kah mash haschu has junihim g Jesus. Kutsh am s‑apkot matsh am wo jiwia wui. Kutsh ab oidk i him k an taht g wehschugaj

MRK05:29	The bleeding stopped immediately, and she felt her body healed from her disease.  	Tsh ha hekaj am wabsh si huh g ehꞌedaj. Tsh e taht mat apꞌet. 
MRK05:30	Jesus, sensing at once that power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who touched my cloak?” 	Kutsh g Jesus taht matsh g doajig gewkdag sha wuhsh ab ab k am ha hekaj i sikoliwua hemajkam ha wui k hab kaij, “Doht an ni‑taht?”

MRK05:32	But Jesus went on looking around to see who had done it.  	Kutsh an i nenhoghim k ab i nei hegai uwi matsh an taht.  
MRK05:33	The woman, realizing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him, and told him the whole truth. 	Kutsh heg si e todsid k ab wui i gehsh k am ahgi mat doa. 
MRK05:34	“My daughter, your trust in me has healed you. Go in peace. You have been completely cured of your disease,” Jesus told her. 	Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “Pegih, ni‑uwiga, am apt wa doa nap pi ab si ni‑hiwig. Gam g s‑ap e‑taht k hihm k am wabsh s‑doakad.” 
MRK05:35	While he was still speaking some people came from the home of the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” they said. “You don't need to bother the Teacher any longer.” 	Kush am wabsh kia neok. Tsh am haꞌi dada ab kihj amjed hegai Jairus k hab kaij, “Muh at g m‑chehiaga. Kupt haschu hig ahgk am baꞌich wo i kudu g ha mashchamdam?”

MRK05:37	He wouldn't let anyone go with him except Peter, James, and James' brother John. 	Bash kaij ch am hahawa ha ui g Peter ch James ch John k am i oi.

MRK05:42	The little girl, who was twelve years old, got up immediately and began walking around. They were completely astonished at what had happened.  	Kutsh ab ha hekaj i wami g chehia k ab i hih. Kutsh si has i e taht g hemajkam.

MRK06:14-15	King Herod got to hear about Jesus since he had become well-known. Some said, “This is John the Baptist risen from the dead. That's why he has such miraculous powers.”  Others said, “It's Elijah.” Still others said, “He's a prophet, like one of the prophets of the past.” 	An o wa wehsko hab kaidag mash has e junihim g Jesus.

MRK06:17-20	For Herod had given orders to arrest and imprison John because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom Herod had married.  John had been saying to Herod, “It's against the law to marry your brother's wife.”  So Herodias had a grudge against John and wanted him killed. But she wasn't able to arrange it  because Herod knew John was a holy man who did what was right. Herod protected John and though what John said was very disturbing to him, he was still happy to hear what he had to say. 	Ihda Herod atsh wa heg hab juh am wehhejed g e‑hohnig. Heg ash hab chehgig Herodias ch ash d chum hohnigaj g Herod wehnag. Kush heg hab chechgig Philip. Tsh g Herod ehs g hohnigaj.

MRK06:22	Herodias' daughter came in and danced for them. Herod and those eating with him were delighted at her performance, so he told the girl,  	Tsh am i wah g uwi madaj g Herodias k am e waila. Kush wehsijj s‑hohhoꞌid. Sh g Herod hab ahg, “Maptp haschu hab wo i elidad ch ab wo i ni‑tai, nt hab wo m‑juni.” Sh pi has shaꞌi kaij ihda uwi.  
MRK06:23	“Ask me for whatever you like, and I'll give it to you.” He confirmed his promise with an oath, “I'll give you up to half my kingdom.” 	Kush hab hahawa ep si kaij, “Maptp haschu ab wo i ni‑tai, nt wo m‑mah, chum as hems eda hugkam g ni‑kownaltalig.” 
MRK06:24	She went out and asked her mother, “What should I ask for?” 	Kutsh am hahawa him k am kakke g e‑jeꞌe, “Shahchu ant wo tai?” 
MRK06:25	The girl hurried back in and said to the king, “I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a plate.” 	Tsh ab uhpam i wah k hab ahg g Herod, “John moꞌo apt wo ni‑mah am hoas‑haꞌa ch ed dahshk” 
MRK06:26	The king was very upset, but because of the oaths he'd made in front of his guests, he didn't want to refuse her.  	Kutsh si pi ap e taht g Herod. Sh wabshaba wehsijj kah mo has i kaij. Tsh heg hekaj pi e nako mas pi am hu hab wo juh,

MRK06:31	“Come with me, just yourselves. We'll go to a quiet place, and rest for a while,” Jesus told them, because there was so much coming and going that they didn't even have time to eat.  	Sh eda iaꞌi idani muꞌi am daiw g hemajkam. Tsh pi am hu shaꞌi ha apkot mas wo e gegos idam Jesus. Sh hab ha ahg g Jesus, “Am att hig wo t‑hejelkod k wo shaꞌi t‑uhꞌulinihogi.”

MRK06:34	When Jesus got off the boat he saw a huge crowd, and he felt pity for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began to teach them about many things. 	k am i huhud.

MRK06:37	But Jesus replied, “You give them something to eat.” 	Kush hab ha ahg, “Ahpim amt wo haꞌichu ha mah mat wo huh.” 
MRK06:38	“Well, how much bread do you have?” Jesus asked. “Go and see.” 	Sh ab ha kakke, “Shahchu o am i kahch? Am g wo neid.” 
MRK06:39	Jesus told everyone to sit down in groups on the green grass.  	Kush hab ha ahg mat wo ha ahgi g hemajkam mat wehsijj am wo dadhaiwua jewedo heꞌekiajj i e wehm.

MRK06:41	Then he took the five loaves and the two fish. Looking up to heaven he blessed the food and broke the bread into pieces. Then he handed the bread to the disciples to give to the people, and he divided the fish up between all of them.  	Kutsh g Jesus am ui hegai haꞌichu hugi k am e dahm i nen k ab hoꞌigeꞌel g Jiosh k am hahawa hahai hegai sismito k ab ha mah g e‑chuhchai. Tsh an i ha mahkhi g hemajkam.

MRK06:44	A total of five thousand men plus their families ate the food. 	Kush am hu d i hetasp mihl chechoj ch muꞌijj g uꞌuwi ch aꞌal hegam matsh am e gegos. 
MRK06:45	Immediately after this Jesus instructed his disciples to get back into the boat. They were to go on ahead to Bethsaida on the other side of the lake while he sent the people on their way.

MRK06:48	He could see them being buffeted about as they rowed hard because the wind was blowing against them. In the early morning hours Jesus came to them, walking on the water. He would have passed them,  	Kush g hewel ab si s‑gewkam med ha wui. Sh hekaj pi ap him. Kush s‑ap ha neid g Jesus mash shaꞌi si s‑wihnam himchud g wahlko. 
MRK06:49	but when they saw him walking on the water they thought he was a ghost. They screamed out  	Tsh wabshaba am i nei s‑chuhugam k ed k am si hihnk nash pi si s‑ehbini hab e ahgch mash d wabsh kokꞌoi. 
MRK06:50	because they could all see him and were absolutely terrified. 	Kush hab ha ah, “Pi g wo shaꞌi ni‑ehbenid. Dani ahni. Mt oi wo s‑ap e taht,”  
MRK06:51	He went over to them and climbed into the boat, and the wind died down. They were totally shocked,  	k gan hu hahawa i chesh wahlko ch ed. Kutsh am wabsh si heweto. Tsh idam si has i el

MRK06:54	As they climbed out, the people immediately recognized Jesus.  	Tsh g hemajkam ha hekaj s‑amich g Jesus

MRK06:56	Wherever he went, in the villages, in the towns, or in the countryside, they put the sick in the marketplaces and begged Jesus to let the sick touch just the edge of his clothes. Everyone who touched him was healed. 	Kush an oiopo hegam Jesus ch am daiw kihhim ch ed ch oidag ch ed.

MRK07:6-8	Jesus replied, “Isaiah was right about you hypocrites when he said, ‘These people claim they honor me, but in their thinking they are far from me.  There's no point in their worship of me, for what they teach as doctrines are merely human rules.’ You disregard God's law, and instead you carefully observe human traditions,” he told them. 	(8) Kush hab kaij g Jesus, “Kum ahpim haschu ahgch im hu hab wabsh wua g Jiosh chehanig ch im hu haꞌab ab s‑wohochud g ha‑chehanig hegam mo d kekelibad ch d wabsh oꞌodham?

MRK07:10	Moses said, ‘Honor your father and mother,’ and ‘Whoever curses their father or mother should die.’ 	Mosesbad at an oꞌoha mo hab kaij g Jiosh: 
MRK07:14-16	Jesus called the crowd to him again and told them, “Please, everyone listen to me and understand.  It's not what's on the outside and goes into you that makes you unclean. It's what comes out that makes you unclean.”    	Kutsh am hahawa ep ha wai g hemajkam k hab kaij am ha wui, “Ab g wo i ni‑kaiham wehsijj ahpim k wo s‑amich ihda.

MRK07:25-26	As soon as a woman, whose little daughter had an evil spirit, heard about him she came and fell at his feet.  The woman was Greek, born in Syrophoenicia.

MRK08:20	“And the seven loaves divided among four thousand. How many basketfuls of leftovers did you pick up?” 	Sh hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Kumt heꞌekia i hoha shuhshud k ui g wihpiꞌidaj mant al wewaꞌak sismitokaj am ha gegos hegam giꞌik mihl chechoj ch muꞌi ehp?”

MRK08:22	They went to Bethsaida where some people brought a blind man to Jesus. They begged Jesus to touch him and heal him.  	Kutsh gam hu dada Bethsaida t am k am i huhud. Kutsh g hemajkam am hema uꞌapa g oꞌodham Jesus wui mash pi nea k ab i e shoꞌigch wui mat ab wo taht.  
MRK08:23	Jesus took the blind man by the hand and took him outside the village. Jesus spat on the man's eyes and touched him with his hands. 	Kutsh an bei g pi neadam nowij an k am i wanimed k gam hu i wuhshad ab kihhim t amjed k ab hahawa siswua wuhpuij ab k ab ep taht k ab kakke, “Shahchu ap hig neid?”

MRK08:25	So Jesus touched the man's eyes again. He could see properly—he was cured and his sight was clear.  	Tsh ab ep taht g wuhpuij. Kutsh ab ep i nea. Tsh g wuhpuij am i apꞌet. Sh hahawa wehs haꞌichu si s‑ap neid.

MRK08:27	Jesus and his disciples left to go to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples, “Who do people say I am?” 	Kutsh gam hu hahawa hihi idam Jesus am haꞌi ep ha wui g kihhim am miabidch g Cesaria Philippi kihhim. Kush g Jesus ab ha kakke ch hab kaij, “Am g wo ni‑ahgid, dohꞌo ni‑elid g hemajkam?” 
MRK08:28	“Some say John the Baptist, some say Elijah, others say one of the prophets,” they replied. 	Kush hab kaij, “Haꞌijj o hab m‑elid map d hegai Johnbad mo chum t‑pahl wapkonahim ch haꞌijj hab ep m‑elid map d Elijabad o hema i ehp hegam kekelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam.” 
MRK08:29	“But who do you say I am?” he asked them. 	Sh ab ep ha kakke g Jesus, “Kum ahpim hig hedai ni‑elid?” 
MRK08:30	Jesus warned them not to tell anybody about him. 	Kush hab ha ahg mat pi hedai wo shaꞌi ha ahgi hemu mo hedai wud. 
MRK08:31	Then Jesus began to explain to them that the Son of man would suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and religious teachers. He would be killed, but three days later would rise again.  	Neh, tsh am i amjed am hahawa haꞌichu ha mashcha ab e amjed hab kaijch mat hemho wa muꞌi wo e shoꞌigch g Jiosh si Kehsha.

MRK08:32	Jesus explained this to them very clearly. But Peter took Jesus aside and started to reprimand him for what he said. 	Neh, sh id am si tasho ha ahgid. 
MRK08:33	Jesus turned around and looking at his disciples, reprimanded Peter. “Get away from me, Satan,” he said. “You're not thinking as God thinks, but as human beings do.” 	Kutsh wabshaba g Jesus ab haꞌab i kekiwua ha wui k ab epai si s‑gewkam neo ab wui g Peter hab kaijch, “Pi g shaꞌi ni‑shohbid. Do wabsh hejel hab m‑elida ihda. Kup ab wui kehk g Jiosh hab elida hab masma mo g ge Jiawul.” 
MRK08:34	Jesus called the crowd and his disciples over to him, and told them, “If you want to follow me, you must give up on yourselves, pick up your cross and follow me.  	Sh eda muꞌij g hemajkam an ha wehgaj. Kutsh ab i ha waid k hab ha ahg, “Mamtp am wo s‑oidam g ni‑himdag k hemho wa gam hu wo dagito g hejel e‑tatchui k ahni ni‑tatchui hab wo junihid ni‑wehhejed e shoꞌigchudch.

MRK08:38	If you're ashamed to acknowledge  me and what I say among this unfaithful and sinful people, then the Son of man will be ashamed to acknowledge you when he comes with his Father's glory with the holy angels.” 	“Muꞌi hemajkam at wabsh s‑tahhadam hab wo junihid g pi apꞌekam ch wo pi em‑haꞌichuchudad.

MRK09:1	Jesus told them, “I tell you the truth: some standing here won't die before they see the kingdom of God having come with power.” 	Neh, bash kaij g Jesus ch hab ep kaij, “Nt wo si shel em‑ahgi mo ia haꞌi haꞌichug hemu mat pi koi wo koi k hoꞌip nei mat baꞌich i s‑gewkam inhab wo i e juh g Jiosh kownaltalig.” 
MRK09:2	Six days later Jesus took Peter, James, and John with him, and led them up a high mountain to be by themselves. His appearance totally changed.  	Kush am d i chuhdp tash amjed. Tsh g Jesus ab i ha wai g Peter ch James ch John. Kutsh idam am wehmaj ab i chehchsh hema uhgk doꞌag t ab k ged hu dada k haha wabsh nei. Tsh am gawul e juh g Jesus.

MRK09:4	Then Elijah and Moses appeared in front of them as well, talking with Jesus. 	Kutsh ab haha wabsh i e chehgi g Elijabad ch Mosesbad k am wehmaj neneok g Jesus. 
MRK09:5-6	Peter spoke up and said, “Rabbi, it's great for us to be here! We should make three shelters—one each for you, Moses, and Elijah.”  (He really didn't know what to say because they were all so frightened!) 	Kutsh si e totods idam Peter. Tsh g Peter wabsh kohsh k daꞌiwuni k hab kaij ab wui g Jesus, “T‑mashchamdam, s‑apꞌe oki mach ia haꞌichug. Tt ia waik wo ha chuhcha g al chechopi matt hekaj ab wo si has em‑el ahpi ch Mosesbad ch Elijabad.” 
MRK09:7	Then a cloud covered them, and a voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, the one I love. Listen to him.” 	Tsh an hahawa si ha ehkaj g chewagi. Tsh g Jiosh neꞌoki ab kaida chewagi t amjed k hab kaij, “Jesus o d si ni‑tatchuidch ni‑alidag. Heg amt ab wo si kaihamad.” 
MRK09:8	Then, all of a sudden, as they were watching, there was nobody. Only Jesus was with them. 	Tsh am hahawa i chum nenhog hegam Peter. Kush hegai waꞌi Jesus hejel am kehk. Sh pi am hu haꞌichug hegam gohk. 
MRK09:9	As they came down the mountain Jesus instructed them not to tell anyone what they'd seen until the Son of man had risen from the dead.  	Sh ab hahawa i huhudkhim doꞌag t amjed. Sh ab si ha chehani g Jesus ch hab kaij, “Pi g am hedai wo shaꞌi ahgid mamt haschu i nei, nt hoꞌip kia am uhpam i wuhsh ab muhkig amjed ahni Jiosh si Kehsha.” 
MRK09:10	They kept this to themselves, but they did argue with each other over what it meant to rise from the dead. 	Kutsh wa woho hab e juh k wabshaba hejel am aꞌaga mas has d ahga ihda mo hab kaij matsh am uhpam wo i wuhsh muhkig t amjed. 
MRK09:11	“Why do the religious teachers state that Elijah has to come first?” they asked him. 	Am hu hebai, sh hab kaij ab wui g Jesus, “Neh, bo chechꞌe hegam chehanig t‑mashchamdam matsh ia wehpeg wo e maskogi g Elijabad. Tsh g Jiosh si Kehsha ia haha wo e maskogi. Pegih, t haschu ahgk pi ia wehpeg m‑baꞌich e maskogi hegai Elijabad.” 
MRK09:12-13	“It's true that Elijah comes first to prepare everything,” Jesus replied. “But why then does it say in Scripture that the Son of man has to suffer so much and be treated with contempt?  However, I tell you that Elijah has come, and they abused him in whatever way they wanted, just as Scripture said they would.” 	Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “Hema at woho wehpeg wo e maskogid k hab wo masmak mash wa g Elijabad ch wehs haꞌichu wo i apꞌech.

K an ep oꞌohanas mat ep wo ni‑shoꞌigchud k wo s‑ni‑ohhod ahni Jiosh si Kehsha.” 
MRK09:14	When they returned to the other disciples, they saw them surrounded by a large crowd and some religious teachers arguing with them.  	Sh ged hu ha aihim hegam mat am wih. Kush muꞌi hemajkam am oiopo. Sh haꞌi d chehanig t‑mashchamdam ch am ha neꞌowin hegam mat am waꞌi wih.  
MRK09:15	As soon as the crowd saw Jesus they were in total awe, and ran to greet him. 	Tsh g hemajkam am i nei mo ab him g Jesus k si s‑ap i e taht k ab i wohp k ab nam. 
MRK09:16	“What are you arguing with them about?” Jesus asked them. 	Sh g Jesus ab ha kakke hegam e‑chuhchai mat am waꞌi wih, “Shahchu am ha wehm aꞌaga?” 
MRK09:17	One of the people in the crowd answered, “Rabbi, I brought my son to you. He has an evil spirit that prevents him speaking.  	Kush am hema g oꞌodham hab kaij ab Jesus wui, “Neh, ia ant heki hu chum uꞌapa g ni‑alidag m‑wui no pi g jiawul an uꞌukch ch pi hiwgid mas wo neo.  
MRK09:18	Whenever he has a seizure it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and he becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive it out of him, but they couldn't do it.” 	Hebai atp am si has tahtchud ch i wuhppa. K g totshagi i chechshshaj chinij ab.

MRK09:19	“You unbelieving people!” Jesus responded. “How long must I remain here with you? How long do I have to put up with you? Bring him over here to me!” 	Sh hab kaij g Jesus am ha wui, “Shoꞌo waꞌi pi geꞌej g em‑wohochudadag. Shahag wepo mant tash ia wo em‑wehmajkad ch ab wo em‑nakogad mat hekaj wo i geꞌeda.” Sh hab hahawa kaij heg wui oꞌodham, “Ab g i bekaꞌi ni‑wui.” 
MRK09:20	So they brought him to Jesus. When the evil spirit saw Jesus it immediately sent the boy into convulsions and threw him on the ground, where he rolled around, foaming at the mouth. 	Kutsh ab hahawa i bei wui. Tsh ab i nei g Jesus. Kutsh g jiawul ha hekaj i wua g ali. Kutsh am gehsh k am si banimmed jewedo. Tsh g totshagi i wuhsh ab chinij ab. 
MRK09:21	“How long has he had this?” Jesus asked the boy's father. 	Jesus ash ab hahawa kakke g ohgaj, “K hekid i amjed hab masma ihda?” 
MRK09:22	“Often it throws him into the fire to burn him to death, or throws him into water to drown him. Please have mercy on us and help, if you can.” 	Muꞌikko o waꞌi chum s‑muꞌamk ch am wuhppa shuhdagi ch ed ch am nahda ch ed. Si g s‑ni‑hoꞌigeꞌid k i wuhshad maptp wo e nako.” 
MRK09:23	“Why do you say, ‘if you can?’ ” replied Jesus. “Whoever trusts has every power!” 	Sh g Jesus hab kaij, “Maptp ahpi wo e nako k ab wo i ni‑hiw. Pi o haꞌichu shaꞌi wihnk am ni‑wehhejed maptp ab wo ni‑hiwgad.” 
MRK09:24	“I do trust in you,” the man shouted out right away. “Help me not to distrust you.” 	Kush hab kaij g ohgaj, “M ani wa heꞌes ab chum m‑hiwig. Oi g i ni‑wehmt. Nt baꞌich ab wo i m‑hiwgad.” 
MRK09:25	Jesus, seeing that the crowd was closing in, commanded the evil spirit, “Spirit that causes deafness and dumbness, I order you to come out of him and never return.” 	Tsh eda ab aꞌaijed i wohp g hemajkam an ha wehgaj. Kush hekaj s‑e hohtkid g Jesus ch si s‑kehꞌel g jiawul k hab ahg, “Dagitoni g ali, ahpi jiawul, k pi dahm an hu ep wo shaꞌi uꞌukchid.” 
MRK09:26	The spirit screamed and threw the boy into severe convulsions. Then the spirit came out of the boy and left him for dead—to the extent that many of the people said, “He's dead.” 	Tsh am si s‑kaidam hihin k ab si s‑gewkam e ugij g ali. Tsh am hahawa dagito. Tsh hab wabsh e juh mat muh g ali. Sh g hemajkam hab kaij, “Muh atki.”  
MRK09:27	But Jesus took the boy by the hand and helped him up, and he got to his feet. 	Tsh wabshaba g Jesus ab bei nowij ab k i wamigi. Tsh i wamig k kekiwua. 
MRK09:28	Later, when Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him in private, “Why couldn't we drive the evil spirit out?” 	Kutsh ged hu i wahp kih ch ed idam Jesus. Tsh g chuhchaij am hahawa hejelko kakke, “Tt haschu ahgk ahchim pi t‑nako machs gam hu hab wo i juh g jiawul?” 
MRK09:29	“This kind can't be driven out except by prayer,” Jesus told them. 	Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “Jiawul at heg waꞌi hekaj gam hu hab wo i e juh mamt ab wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahu Jiosh wui.” 
MRK09:30	They left and passed through Galilee. Jesus didn't want anyone to know where he was  	Tsh amjed gam hu hahawa hihim k gam hu gahi wuwha g Galilee chekshani. Tsh g Jesus pi am hu e chehgi hemajkam ha wui no pi ha mashchamahim g e‑chuhchai ch hab ha ahg,  
MRK09:31	because he was teaching his disciples. “The Son of man will be betrayed to human authorities,” he told them. “They will kill him, but three days later he will rise again.”  	“E o aihim mat g s‑ni‑kehꞌiddam wo ni‑bei ahni Jiosh si Kehsha k am wo ni‑dagito haꞌi ha wui mat wo ni‑mua. Nt wabshaba ep wo ni‑chegito mat d wo i waik tashk amjed.”  
MRK09:32	They didn't understand what he meant and were too afraid to ask him about it. 	Sh oi wa pi shaꞌi amichud mas haschu hab ahg ch wabshaba pi ab hu kakke nat pi e totods. 
MRK09:33	They arrived at Capernaum, and once they were inside the house where they were staying, Jesus asked them, “What were you talking about on the way?”  	Kutsh am hihim k ged hu dada Capernaum t am k am i wahp kih ch ed mash hebai dadha. Sh eda haꞌi haꞌichukaj e neꞌowin hihimadch. Kush ab hahawa ha kakke ch hab kaij, “Shahchukaj am e neꞌowinahim mach ab hihim?” 
MRK09:34	But they didn't say anything because they had been arguing over who was the most important. 	Kush oi wa pi hedai has shaꞌi kaij nash pi eda e neꞌowinahim mas hedai baꞌich d wo i s‑has haꞌichuk. 
MRK09:35	Jesus sat down and called the twelve disciples together. “If anyone wants to be first, he has to be the very last, the servant of everyone else,” he told them.  	Kutsh am i dahiwua g Jesus k ab i ha wai. Tsh am i e hemapai wui. Kush hab ha ahg, “Pi g wo chum ge e haꞌichuchudad mamtp hedai d wo uhgchuk am e‑shahgid ch wabshaba hab wo e junihid mamt wehs d wo ha‑pionagk.” 
MRK09:36	He took a small child and had the child stand right in the middle of them. Then he picked up and hugged the child, and told them,  	Sh am hema kehk g ali. Kutsh g Jesus an be k am kohm k hab kaij,  
MRK09:37	“Whoever welcomes a child like this in my name, welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me doesn't welcome me but the One who sent me.” 	“Matp hedai hema wo ha dagioꞌidad g ali am ni‑wehhejed ch hekaj am wo e chehgidch mo ab si ni‑tatchua ch ab ep si tatchua hegai mani d kehshaj.” 
MRK09:38	John said to Jesus, “Rabbi, we saw someone driving out demons in your name. We tried to stop him because he wasn't one of us.” 	Kush g John hab kaij ab wui g Jesus, “Hema oki gam hu hab i ha wua g jijawul heg hekaj m‑chehgig. Kuch am chum shohbid no ge m‑wecho e mashcham.” 
MRK09:39	“Don't stop him,” Jesus replied. “For no one who is doing miracles in my name can curse me at the same time.  	Kush hab ha ahg, “Pi g am wo shaꞌi shohbid. Pi at woho has wo ni‑ah matp hedai hekaj g ni‑chehgig ch hab wua g s‑wihnk haꞌichu.  
MRK09:40	Anyone who is not against us is for us.  	Tki wo i t‑wehmt hegai matp hedai pi ab hu t‑wui kehk.  
MRK09:41	Anyone who gives a cup of water to you in my name, because you belong to Christ, won't lose their reward, believe me. 	Nt wo si shel em‑ahgi matp hedai wo i em‑wasibi g shuhdagi ahpim mam ab si ni‑wecho e mashcham k wo bei g s‑apꞌekam e‑namkidadag.” 
MRK09:42	But if anyone leads one of these little ones who trust in me into sin, it would be better for them if they were thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around their neck.  	Sh hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Shoꞌo waꞌi si s‑ta ehbidam hab mahs am wehhejed hegai matp hedai hema am wo i ha wanchkwua pi apꞌekam wui idam al aꞌal mo ab al ni‑hiwig. Baꞌich at wo i s‑apꞌek wehhejed matp hems wo e wachumchud k wo e muhkid mat koi hab wo juh ihda chuꞌijig. 
MRK09:43-48	If your hand leads you to sin, cut it off! It's better to enter eternal life as a cripple than to go with both hands into Gehenna , into the fire that can't be put out.     If your foot causes you to sin, cut it off! It's better to enter eternal life lame than to be thrown into Gehenna still having two feet.    If your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out! It's better to enter the kingdom of God with just one eye than to be thrown into Gehenna still having both eyes,  where the worm doesn't die and the fire never goes out.  	“Pi at hedai wo e nako mas ab uhpam wo i wuhsh Jiawul kih amjed.

MRK09:50	Salt is good, but if it loses its taste, how could you make it salty again? You need to be like salt, and live in peace with one another.” 	Mt wabshaba hejel ab wo e abchud k wo dagito hemu.

Kutsh oi wa pi hohhoꞌi g Jesus matsh chum pi ha hiwigi k hab ha ahg, “Ab g wabsh wo i ha hiwgid g al aꞌal mat ab wo i hihi ni‑wui k pi an hu wo shaꞌi ha shohbi.

MRK10:29-30	“I tell you the truth,” Jesus replied, “anyone who has left behind their home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands because of me, and for the sake of the good news,  will receive in return in due course a hundred times as many homes and brothers and sisters and children and lands—as well as persecution. In the world to come they will receive eternal life.

MRK10:32	They continued on their way to Jerusalem, with Jesus walking on ahead. The disciples were apprehensive and the other followers were afraid. So Jesus took the disciples aside and began to explain to them what was about to happen to him.  	Kutsh gam hu i oi g wohg Jerusalem wui. Sh gam hu ha baꞌich him g Jesus.

MRK11:1	As they approached Jerusalem, near to Bethphage and Bethany, beside the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples on ahead.  	Sh amjed ab hihim idam Jesus Jerusalem wui.

MRK11:15	They arrived back in Jerusalem, and Jesus went into the Temple. He started driving out the people who were buying and selling in the Temple.

MRK12:38-39	Jesus continued to teach them, saying, “Beware of religious leaders! They love to walk around in long robes, to be greeted respectfully in the marketplaces.  They love to have the most important seats in the synagogues, and the best places at banquets.  	Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “Hegam mo d chehanig em‑mashchamdam o am si s‑apko dadhaiwup mam am e hehemapad ch si s‑kehg e enigadad ch an oiopo no pi si tatchua mamt ab wo si has ha elidad.

MRK12:43-44	He called his disciples together and told them, “I tell you the truth: this poor widow has put in more than all the rest together.  All of them gave from their wealth what they had, but she gave from her poverty what she didn't have. She put in all she had to live on.” 	Sh g Jesus am ha ahgid g e‑chuhchai, “Nehꞌe, hegam mo haꞌichu s‑edgid o hi wa baꞌich i mumuꞌi am toꞌaw.

MRK14:37	Then Jesus returned and found the disciples asleep. “Simon, are you sleeping?” he asked Peter. “Couldn't you stay awake for just an hour?  	Tsh am hahawa uhpam ep jiwia ha wui hegam waik. Kush am kohksh. Sh hab kaij ab wui g Peter, “Simon, pi aptki shaꞌi e nako maps am hu i hemako ohla ab wo s‑nenashank,”

MRK14:39	He left them once more, and prayed, saying the same things.  	Bash kaij ch amjed gam hu hahawa ep him k heg hab kaij ab Jiosh wui matsh wehpeg  
MRK14:40	Then he returned, and again he found them sleeping because they couldn't keep their eyes open.  They didn't know what to say!  	ch am hahawa uhpam ep jiwia ha wui. Kush ep si kohksh ch pi shaꞌi nenashani ch pi shaꞌi mahch mas has wo chei ab wui. 
MRK14:41	He returned a third time, and asked them, “Are you still asleep? Are you still resting? Well that's enough, because the time has come! Look, the Son of man is about to be betrayed into the hands of sinners.  	Ash d i waikkokam, tsh am ep jiwia ha wui. Kush ep si kohksh. Kush hab kaij, “Kumtki ep kohk k e uhꞌulinihogid.

MRK14:42	Get up! Let's go! See, here comes my betrayer.” 	Oi g wo wahpamigi. Tt wo hihi. Neh, ia at hu jiwia hegai mat ni‑gagda.” 
MRK14:43	Just as he was saying this, Judas—one of the twelve disciples—arrived with a mob carrying swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests, religious leaders, and elders.  	Sh am wabsh kia neok. Tsh am jiwia g Judas. Kush shaꞌi si muꞌijj am wehmaj haꞌijj g iꞌis‑papayo uhꞌukch ch haꞌijj g uꞌus.

MRK14:44	Now the betrayer had arranged a sign with them: “He's the one that I kiss. Arrest him, and take him away under guard.” 	Kush eda g Judas heki hu ha ahgid idam mo am wehmaj matsh ab wo chintad g Jesus kahmaj ab. Tsh hab masma wo s‑mahchk mat hedai an wo bei.  
MRK14:45	Judas went right up to Jesus. “Rabbi,” he said, and kissed him affectionately.  	Tsh am wabsh i chum jiwia g Judas k wabsh shel i hih ab Jesus wui k hab kaij, “Ni‑mashchamdam.” Neh, bash kaij ch ab chintad. 
MRK14:46	So they grabbed hold of Jesus and arrested him.  	Tsh ab haꞌi hihim k an bei g Jesus k gan hu si s‑wihnam uꞌukch.  
MRK14:47	But one of those standing there pulled out his sword and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear. 	Kutsh hema hegam chuhchaij am i wuhshad g e‑ispahyo k ab si gehg g neholigaj g uhgchu pahl k an si hikuch g nahkaj. 
MRK14:48-49	“Am I some kind of rebel that you have come to arrest me with swords and clubs?” Jesus asked them.  “I was there with you, teaching in the Temple every day. Why didn't you arrest me then? But this is happening to fulfill the Scriptures.” 	Sh g Jesus hab ha ahg idam hemajkam, “Wehs tashkaj ani am dahiwup ch ha mashcham geꞌe cheopi t am.

MRK14:50	Then all Jesus' disciples deserted him and ran away.  	Kutsh am hahawa wehsijj wabsh i dagito hegam chuhchaij k gam hu si aꞌai wohp. 
MRK14:51	(One of his followers was a young man who was wearing only a linen garment.  	Sh an hema oidahim g Jesus ch d wabsh wechij oꞌodham ch heg waꞌi sawanokaj e hobinodch. Kutsh an chum bei g shondal.  
MRK14:52	They seized hold of him, but he ran off naked, leaving the garment behind.) 	Tsh am wabsh i dagito g e‑sawano k gam hu si meh ab wabsh i s‑dahpkch. 
MRK14:53	They took Jesus to the high priest's house where all the chief priests, elders, and religious teachers had gathered.  	Kumtsh am i bei g Jesus heg kih wui uhgchu pahl. Kush eda am e hemapdahim g uꞌugchu papal ch geꞌeged ch chehanig t‑mashchamdam. 
MRK14:54	Peter followed him at a distance, and went into the courtyard of the high priest's house. He sat down with the guards and warmed himself by the fire. 	Sh g Peter ga hu wabsh mehkjed ha oid ch am i wah kolhai ch ed. Sh am ge nahdch g shondal. Kush am ha wehm e huhkalid g Peter. 
MRK14:55	Inside the chief priests and the whole governing council were trying to find some evidence to have Jesus put to death, but they couldn't find anything.  	Kush eda idam e jehnigiddam am i chum haꞌichu gahg mat ab wo abch g Jesus mat heg hekaj wo mua.  
MRK14:56	Many were giving false testimony against him, but their statements didn't agree. 	Muꞌijj ash ab haꞌichu chum abchud mash pi shaꞌi woho ch oi wa pi shaꞌi e wepo haꞌichu ahg. 
MRK14:57	Some of them got up to speak falsely against Jesus.  	Kutsh am hahawa haꞌi gegokiwua k hab kaij,  
MRK14:58	“We heard him say, ‘I will destroy this Temple that human hands built, and in three days I will build another without hands.’ ”  	“Kah ach mo hab kaij. ‘Nt wo padch ihda geꞌe cheopi mat g oꞌodham hab juh k hema ep wo nahto waik tash ab mat pi d wo oꞌodham nahtoik.’ ”  
MRK14:59	But even so their testimony didn't agree. 	Kush idam hab waꞌap pi shaꞌi e wepot g haꞌichu ha‑ahga. 
MRK14:60	Then the high priest stood up in front of the council, and asked Jesus, “Have you nothing to say in response to these charges made against you?”  	Kutsh g si uhgchu pahl am i kekiwua ha shahgid k ab kakke g Jesus, “Napt pi am hu has wo shaꞌi chei id amjed mo haschu ab m‑abchud idam?” 
MRK14:61	But Jesus remained silent and didn't answer. So the high priest asked again, “Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?” 	Kush oi wa pi am hu has shaꞌi ha kaij g Jesus. 
MRK14:62	“I am,” Jesus replied, “and you will see the Son of man sitting on the right of the Mighty One, and coming with the clouds of heaven.” 	Kush hab kaij g Jesus, “Dani ahni. T g Jiosh am wo e chehgi mo ab si has ni‑elid an s‑apkojed e‑hugid an ni‑dahshk e‑kownal daikud ed. T ab wo i e ai mant ab wo i hud chewagi ch ed k am ep wo jiwia jewed dahm. Kumt wehsijj wo s‑mai mani d Jiosh si Kehsha.” 
MRK14:63	The high priest tore his clothes and asked, “Why do we need any more witnesses?  	Kutsh g uhgchu pahl ab si wantsh g e‑eniga hab elidch mo pi ap neok k hab kaij, “Pi ach hedai ep shaꞌi tatchua mas am wo ah g chuꞌijigaj.  
MRK14:64	You have heard the blasphemy! What's your reaction?” 	Am am wa kah g pi kehg neꞌokij. Shahm i elid?” 
MRK14:65	Then some of them began to spit on him. They blindfolded him, hit him with their fists, and said, “Why don't you prophesy then, you ‘Prophet’!” The guards took him away and beat him up. 	Kutsh haꞌijj ab si siswuimad g Jesus. Mtsh ab hahawa si maꞌishk wuh g wuhpuij k ab si shonikkash ch hab ahg, “Am g hig t‑ahgid mas hedai ab m‑shonikka.” Tsh g shondal am hahawa be k ab si s‑kapnim shonikkash. 
MRK14:66	Meanwhile Peter was down below in the courtyard. One of the high priest's servant-girls passed by,  	Sh eda g Peter am daha kih bahsho. Kutsh am hema jiwia g uwi piongaj g uhgchu pahl.  
MRK14:67	and seeing Peter warming himself, looked straight at him and said, “You were with Jesus of Nazareth too!” 	Sh am daha g Peter ch e huhkalid. Tsh id ab si i neid k hab kaij, “Ahpi ap ep wehmaj hegai Jesus.” 
MRK14:68	But he denied it. “I don't know what you're talking about or what you mean,” he replied. Then he went out to the forecourt, and a rooster crowed. 	Kutsh pi mahch k e ah g Peter hab kaijch, “Pi ani shaꞌi mahch ch pi amichud maps haschu hab ahg,” neh, k gam hu ha hekaj hih mash am haꞌi gegok kolhai kihjeg t ab. Kush eda kuhu g keli chuchul.

MRK14:70	Once more Peter denied it. A little while later they said to Peter again, “You're definitely one of them because you're a Galilean too!” 	Kutsh ep pi e edagi g Peter. 
MRK14:71	Peter began calling down curses on himself and he swore, “I don't know this man who you're talking about.”  	Kutsh g Peter am ha hekaj si ha ahgi, “Pi ani shaꞌi mahch ihda oꞌodham mam an aꞌaga. T g Jiosh wo si ni‑jehkaꞌich mantp em‑iattogid.” 
MRK14:72	Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” When he realized what he'd done, he burst into tears. 	Kutsh am ha hekaj gokko kuhu g keli chuchul. Tsh g Peter am wabsh si i chegito mash wa hab kaij g Jesus, “Koi at gokko wo kuhu g chuchul kupt eda heki hu waikko hab wo chei map pi shaꞌi ni‑mahch.” Tsh wabsh wohoꞌi pi ap e taht k s‑jupij shoak. 
MRK15:1	Early the next morning, the chief priest, elders, and religious teachers—the whole governing council—came to a decision. They had Jesus bound and sent him to be handed over to Pilate. 	Tsh am wabsh i chum mahsi. Tsh am ep e nam hegam uꞌugchu papal ch geꞌeged ch chehanig t‑mashchamdam mo d e jehnigiddam k atsh am i mamche mat has hahawa ep wo e juh. Tsh am i kuhgit g ha‑namki.

MRK15:2	Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” 	Kush ihda Pilate ab kakke g Jesus, “No wa woho mapsh hab chum e elid map d ha‑kownalig idam Tutuligo hemajkam?” 
MRK15:3	The chief priests kept on making many accusations against him.  	Sh g uꞌugchu papal muꞌi haꞌichu ab abchud. Sh pi am hu has shaꞌi kaij g Jesus. 
MRK15:4	Pilate questioned him again, “Aren't you going to answer? See how many charges they're bringing against you!”  	Sh g Pilate ab ep kakke, “Neh, muꞌi haꞌichu o ab m‑abchud. Napt pi am hu has wo shaꞌi chei ab amjed?” 
MRK15:5	But Jesus didn't give any more answers, much to Pilate's surprise. 	Kush ep pi am hu has shaꞌi ha kaij g Jesus. Tsh g Pilate si has i e taht heg hekaj. 
MRK15:6	Now it was Pilate's custom at the Passover feast to release a prisoner to the people, whoever they requested.  	K am hab e wua ahid ab id eda gegosig mo g kownal am hema i dadagitod g lihso am ha wehhejed g hemajkam.

MRK15:8	The crowd went to Pilate and asked him to release a prisoner following his usual custom. 	Kutsh g hemajkam ab i kakke g Pilate matsh am hab hig wo ha juni hegai mash chum hekid am hab ha wuijid. 
MRK15:9	“Do you want me to release to you the King of Jews?” he asked them,  	Sh g Pilate ab ha kakke, “Pegih, nam hab elid mant id am wo i dagito am em‑wehhejed mash d em‑kownalig?” nash pi chum s‑dagitoimk g Jesus  
MRK15:10	for he realized that it was because of their jealousy of Jesus that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him.  	ch hab ha elid mo d waꞌi idam uꞌugchu papal ch s‑hehgamk ch s‑muꞌamk. 
MRK15:11	But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas to them instead. 	Kutsh wabshaba g uꞌugchu papal am i ha cheha g hemajkam matsh hab wo chei matsh g Barabbas wo e dagito. Kutsh wa woho am hab e juh. 
MRK15:12	“Then what should I do with the one you call the King of the Jews?” he asked them. 	Kush hab ep kaij g Pilate, “Pegih, kunt has wo juh ihda oꞌodham mam hab aꞌaga mo d em‑kownalig?” 
MRK15:13	“Crucify him!” they shouted back. 	Kush si s‑kaidam hab kaij g hemajkam, “Muꞌani ab kots t ab!” 
MRK15:14	“Why? What crime has he committed?” Pilate asked them. 	Kutsh hab chum chei g Pilate, “Haschu ahg? Shahchu at hig pi ap has juh?” 
MRK15:15	Wanting to please the mob, Pilate released Barabbas to them. First he had Jesus flogged and then handed him over to be crucified.  	Kush g Pilate tatchua mat wo s‑hohhoꞌi g hemajkam ch atsh heg hekaj am i dagito g Barabbas am ha wui k am ha cheha g shondal mat am wo gewitta g Jesus. Kumtsh wa woho hab juh.

MRK15:19	They repeatedly beat him around the head with a rod, spat at him, and fell on their knees before him as if in worship.  	Tsh haꞌi an si gewitta moꞌoj an g uhskaj k ab siswuimad k ab wui i shul pehegia ab has elidch.  
MRK15:20	After they finished mocking him, they took off the purple robes, and put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him away to be crucified.  	Kumtsh am i haꞌasa nahnkogid k am si wuahawua hegai kownal eniga k ab uhpam wahki g enigaj k gam hu hahawa i bei mat ab wo naggia kots t ab. 
MRK15:21	They forced a passer-by, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming from the countryside, to carry his cross. Simon was the father of Alexander and Rufus. 	D ab hema i ha nam g oꞌodham ch ab him Jerusalem wui ch ash hab chehgig Simon. Id ad an bei g shondal k ab kushwiotach hegai kots mamt ab ab wo naggia g Jesus.

MRK15:35	Some of those standing there heard this, and said, “He's calling for Elijah.”  	D haꞌijj hab kaij hegam mad am gegok, “Nehꞌe, Elijabad o ab chum waid.” 
MRK15:36	One man ran and filled a sponge with vinegar, put it on a stick, and tried to give it to Jesus to drink. “Leave him alone,” he said. “Let's see if Elijah will come to take him down.”  	Kud am hema med k an haꞌichu usko mad am wakch nawait ch ed k am uhgk i be k ab chum iꞌich g Jesus k hab chei, “Kia koi, tt hig wo nei mas ia wo jiwia g Elijabad k ab wo i huduni.”

MRK15:42-43	It was Friday, the day before the Sabbath. When evening came,  Joseph of Arimathea, a member of the governing council who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, had the courage to go to Pilate and ask for Jesus' body.  	D am haꞌichug hegai e jehnigiddam mo ab Arimathea t amjed ch hab chehgig Joseph. Id o si s‑ap d oꞌodham ch ab s‑neidamk g Jiosh kownaltalig. D eda e aihim mat wo i hud.

MRK15:45	Once he had confirmation from the centurion, Pilate gave permission for Joseph to take the body.  	Sh id hab kaij mat heki hu muh. 
MRK15:46	Joseph bought a linen sheet. Then he took Jesus' body down from the cross and wrapped it in the sheet, and placed it in a tomb that had been cut out of rock. Then he rolled a heavy stone up against the entrance.  	Kutsh g Joseph am him k am ha nolawt g si s‑kehg ikus k am ep jiwia. Kumd am wehhejed ab i huduni g Jesus honshpadag.

MRK16:14	After this he appeared to the eleven disciples as they were eating. He rebuked them for their lack of trust and their stubbornness, because they had not believed those who'd seen him after he had risen.

PHM01:4-7	I always thank my God for you, remembering you in my prayers,  because I hear of your trust in the Lord Jesus and your love for all believers.  I pray that you will put the generous nature of your trust in God into action as you recognize all the good things we share in Christ.  Your love, my dear brother, has brought me much happiness and encouragement. You have revived the hearts of those of us who believe!

PHM01:13-14	I'd have preferred to keep him here with me so that he could have helped me as you would have done while I am in chains for telling the good news.  But I decided not do anything without your permission. I didn't want you to be forced to do good, but to do so willingly.

PHP01:5	because you've been partners with me in spreading the good news right from the beginning up till now.  	Am am chikpanid g Jiosh ch haꞌichukaj am i ni-wehmaj gd hu i amjed mani wa am em-ahgid g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh.  
PHP01:6	I'm absolutely sure that God who began this good work in you will continue working and bring it to a successful conclusion when Jesus Christ returns.

PHP01:7	It's appropriate for me to be thinking this way about all of you because you mean so much to me. Whether I'm in prison or out there making the good news clear, all of you share God's grace together with me.  	Bani wa masma hab em-elid nani pi chum hekid am i em-chegitod.

PHP01:10	so that you can work out what's really important. That way you can be genuine and blameless when Christ returns,  	Mt heg amjed wo s-mahchk hegai mo s-apꞌe mamt hab wo junihid ch pi am hu wo edak g pi apꞌekam ch pi wo ha chuꞌijigk mat hekid ep wo jiwia g Jesus Christ.

PHP01:12	I want you to know, my brothers and sisters, that all I've experienced has worked out to move the good news forward!  	S-em-ahgidamk ani mo baꞌich i e gantan ihda s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh heg hekaj mani ia kuhpi.  
PHP01:13	For everyone—including the whole praetorian guard now knows that I'm in chains for Christ;  	Wehsijj o s-mahch ia geꞌe kownal kih am ch an wehgaj mani d lihso heg waꞌi hekaj mani d piongaj g Jesus Christ.  
PHP01:14	and because of my chains most of the Christians here have been encouraged to speak God's word boldly and fearlessly!  	K g t-wehm wohochuddam pi haꞌichu shaꞌi ehbid ch baꞌich i s-gewkam ia ahg g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga neidch mani wabsh s-ap ab nakog g ni-shoꞌigdag. 
PHP01:15-17	Yes, some speak out of jealousy and rivalry. However there are those who speak from good motives.  They act out of love, because they know that I'm meant to be here to defend the good news.  Those others present Christ deceptively because of their selfish ambitions, trying to cause me problems in my imprisonment. 	Haꞌi o am hi chikpan ab si hejel e-tatchui amjed mat baꞌich wo i chum wahmud g haꞌichu pi ni-apꞌedag hemuch mani wa hu d lihso no pi s-ni-hehgamk ch wabsh ni-pipꞌichud.

PHP01:18	But so what? All I care about is that Christ is presented every which way, whether just pretending or whether from true convictions. That's what makes me happy—and I will go on being happy!  	K pi has chuꞌig. Ni wabsh s-ap ni-tahtk mo e ahgachug g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga, chum as haꞌi pi ap haꞌichu e-tatchui ab am wo ahgahi. 
PHP01:19	Why? Because I'm convinced that through your prayers for me, and through the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, this will turn out to be my salvation. 	E am hoꞌigeꞌidahun am ni-wehhejed. K g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag i ni-wehmaj. Ni heg hekaj si s-ap ni-tahtk ch s-mahch mamt wo i ni-wuhshad.  
PHP01:20	For it's my strongest hope and expectation not to do anything of which I would be ashamed. Instead it's my bold hope, as always, that even now Christ will be greatly honored through me, whether I live or die. 	Tatchua ani mant chum hekid wehs hab wo juh mo haschu i ni-tatchuid g Christ pi haꞌichu ehbidch, wahm hemuch. Bant masma ab wo si has elidad wehs ni-ihbdagkaj, chum anis hems wo ni-muhkid heg hekaj. 
PHP01:21	As far as I'm concerned, living is for Christ, and dying brings gain.  	Neh, pi o has d ahga g ni-doakag ni-wehhejed. Chum ani hi wa s-wehmjimk g Christ. K heg hekaj chum s-apꞌe mant hu wo i muh.  
PHP01:22-23	But if I'm to go on living here and this would be productive work, then I really don't know what's best to choose!  For I'm in a dilemma—I really want to leave and be with Christ, which would be far better,  	Ntp wabshaba d wo doakamk ch baꞌich wo i chikpandad g Christ. Ni-wehhejed o hi wa baꞌich i s-apꞌe mant wo muhk k wo wehmajk g Christ.  
PHP01:24	and yet to remain physically here is more important as far you're concerned.  	K wabshaba em-wehhejed hi baꞌich i s-apꞌe mant d wo doakamk.  
PHP01:25	Since I'm absolutely sure of this, I know that I'll stay here, remaining with you all to help you as your trust and delight in God grows,  	Ni heg hekaj s-mahch mant d wo doakamk ch hab am wo i em-wehmajk. Mt wo i geꞌehogat am e-wohochudadag ed ch hab wo si s-ap e tahtkkad.  
PHP01:26	so that when I see you again your praise to Christ Jesus may be even greater because of me. 	Am ant wo em-wehmajk. Kumt baꞌich ab wo i si has elidad g Christ ni-hekaj. 
PHP01:27	Just be sure that the way you live your lives corresponds to the good news of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or not I can get to hear how you're doing—that you stand firm in full agreement with one another, spiritually united as you work together for the trusting faith of the good news.  	Bamt masma wo himad g e-doakag mamt wo haꞌichuch g s-kehg haꞌichu ahga ab amjed g Christ.

PHP01:28	Don't let your enemies scare you. By being brave you will demonstrate to them that they will be lost, but that God himself will save you.  	Pi g wo shaꞌi ha ehbidad hegam mo ab em-wui gegok. T heg amjed wo s-mahchk mat ab wo bei g s-koꞌok e-namkidadag. Mt ahpim ab wo bei g e-doꞌibiadag ab amjed g Jiosh.

PHP01:30	You're experiencing the same struggle you saw me having—a struggle I still have, as you now know. 	Ab amt wui wo gegokkad g pi apꞌekam hab masma mam am wa neid mani hab ni-wua ch hemu kah mani hab wabsh kia ni-wua. 
PHP02:1	So then, if you're encouraged by being in Christ, if you're comforted by his love, if you share together in the Spirit, if you have compassion and sympathy—  	Bani em-elid mam s-ap ab e dagitokch Jesus Christ wui. K heg ab si i em-gewkemhun. Kum si s-ap e tahtk no pi si em-tatchua. Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag o am em-wehmaj. Kum aꞌai e hekaj si pihk e elid.

PHP02:5	The attitude you should have is the same as that of Christ Jesus.  	Bamt masma haꞌichu wo chum chegitok mash wa g Jesus Christ ch pi hejel wo chum si e haꞌichuch. 
PHP02:12	So, my good friends, continue to work towards the goal of salvation with complete reverence and respect for God, following what you were told—not just when I was with you, but even more so now I'm away from you.  	Ni-naipijju, chum am hekid s-wohog elid hegai Jiosh haꞌichu ahga mani wa am em-ahgid mani eda em-wehmaj. K baꞌich d i si haꞌichu mamt ab wo s-wohog elidad hemu mani wa chum pi am hu em-wehmaj. Am g wabsh wo chikpanad ch wo geꞌegeꞌelhid am e-doꞌibiadag ed ch ab wo si has elidad g Jiosh.  
PHP02:13	For it's God who is working within you, creating the will and the ability to do what he wants you to do.  	Chum o hekid em-makiog g Jiosh g tatchuidag ch gewkdag mamt am hab wo junihid g hab elidaj.  
PHP02:14	Do everything without complaining or arguing  	Kumt heg am hab wo junihid pi has ahgch mamt hekid heg hekaj wo e shoꞌigch.  
PHP02:15	so that you'll be sincere, innocent of any wrong. Be God's blameless children living in the middle of a dishonest and corrupt people.

That way I'll have something to be proud of when Christ returns, proving I didn't run around and work for nothing!  	am ha ahgidch mo g Jiosh ab ha makiog g wechij doakag.

PHP02:17	So even if I pour out my life as a sacrifice and offering so you may trust in God, I'm happy for it, and I'm glad together with all of you,  	Ab amt i s-wohoch g haꞌichu ni-ahga k am i e dagito Jiosh wui hab sha masma mo wa ab wui haꞌichu e iagchulid.

PHP02:18	just as you have such joy and are glad with me. 	Pegih, ahpim g ep wo si s-ap e tahtk ni-wehm matp g Jiosh hab wa masma wo haꞌichuch g ni-chikpan. 
PHP02:19	I'm hoping, if that's what the Lord Jesus wants, to send Timothy to you soon. It will cheer me up once I know how you're doing.  	Hemu ant wo cheha g Timothy mat am wo i em-chehgim matp d wo t-kownalig Jesus tatchuik. T heg ia wo uꞌapa g haꞌichu ahga ab em-amjed mat am wo i ni-gewkemhu.

PHP02:22	But you already know what he's like—just as a child working to help his father, so he's worked with me to spread the good news.  	Kum eda am wa s-mahch mo hab masma ni-wehm chikpan g Timothy mo g ha-alidag.  
PHP02:23	So I hope to send him as soon as I see how I'm doing,  	Hemu ant wo s-mai matp haschu has wo i mahsk am ni-wehhejed. T am haha wo hih g Timothy em-wui. 
PHP02:24	and I trust in the Lord that shortly I'll be able to come too.  	Bani elid mo d tatchuij g t-kownalig Jesus mant ahni am hab waꞌap wo i him k wo em-nei. 
PHP02:25	But I thought it was important to send Epaphroditus to you. He's a brother to me, a co-worker and fellow-soldier. He's the one you sent to look after me,  	Ia ant wo cheha g em-kehsha Epaphroditus mat am uhpam ep wo hih em-wui. Ia o i ni-wehmaj hab masma mamsh am ahgid ch muꞌi haꞌichu ni-wehm nakog.

PHP02:27	He certainly was sick—he nearly died—but God had mercy on him. Not just on him, but on me too, so that I wouldn't have tragedy upon tragedy.  	Woho o wa mat si mumku k chum alo muh. T wabshaba g Jiosh ab si i s-hoꞌigeꞌid k doaj. K hab waꞌap d ni-hoꞌigeꞌidadag mat pi muh nant pi wo si pi ap ni-taht mat hems wo sha muh.  
PHP02:28	That's why I'm so keen to send him, so that when you see him you'll be happy, and I won't have to be so anxious.  	Ni heg hekaj chehani mat am uhpam wo hih. Mt hab wo si s-hehgigk am neidok. Nt ahni hab waꞌap wo si s-hehgigk ch pi wo ni-kudu em-hekaj.  
PHP02:29-30	So welcome him with much happiness in the Lord—honor people like him,  because in working for Christ he nearly died, putting his life on the line to make up for the help you weren't in a position to give me. 	Kumt ab wo si has el nat pi pi huwi g e-doakag mat hab wo juh g Christ tatchui k wo i ni-wehmt em-wehhejed. 
PHP03:1	To sum up: my dear friends, delight in the Lord! It's not a burden for me to repeat these things to you—it's to keep you safe!  	Mt wabsh wo si s-hehgigk mo d em-kownalig g Jesus Christ.

REV02:14	But I have a few things against you: There are some among you who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak how to entrap the children of Israel by means of eating food sacrificed to idols and committing sexual sins.  	“K wabshaba am haꞌichu d hegai mani pi hohoꞌid am em-shahgid.

REV02:17	If you have ears, listen to what the Spirit is telling the churches. I will give the hidden manna to those who are victorious. I will give them a white stone with a new name written on it that nobody knows except those who receive it. 	“Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag o am i maskogid g haꞌichu ni-ahga am em-wui ahpim mam ab si ni-hiwig ch am kihdag ha eꞌeda hegam wewaꞌak kihhim.

REV02:20	But I have something against you: you are allowing the woman called Jezebel who calls herself a prophetess to teach my followers, leading them astray into sexual sins, and to eat food sacrificed to idols.  	“K wabshaba am haꞌichu d hegai mani pi hohhoꞌid am em-shahgid.

REV02:26-28	I will give authority over the nations to those who are victorious and who do what I say until the end.  He will rule the nations with an iron rod, breaking them into pieces like clay pots.  In the same way that I received authority from my Father,  I will give them the morning star. 	“Ni-ohg Jiosh at ab ni-mah g gewkdag mant wehs s-gewkam wo ha dahmkad g jejewed ch wo ha padch g pi apꞌekam kokownaltalig.

REV05:6	I saw a Lamb that looked as if it had been killed standing in the center by the throne and the four living creatures, among the elders.

REV06:15	The kings of the earth, the great leaders, the wealthy, the powerful, and all people, slave or free, hid themselves in caves and among the rocks in the mountains.

REV06:16	They called on the mountains and the rocks, telling them, “Fall upon us!

REV07:1	Then I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth holding back the earth's four winds to prevent any wind from blowing on the earth, or over the sea, or against any tree.  	Ntki haha wabsh ha nei g giꞌik anghil. K hema ab kehk siꞌalig tahgio ch hema ab huduni tahgio ch hema ab wakolim tahgio k ch hema ab juhpin tahgio.

REV07:2	I watched another angel rise up from the east, holding the seal of the living God. He shouted in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given the power to damage the earth and the sea,  	Kuni hahawa hema ep neid g anghil. Kuki id ab him siꞌal wecho amjed ch g Jiosh cheposidakud uꞌa. Kuki eda ab mahks hegam giꞌik mat wo padch g jewed ch kahchki. K wabshaba ihda hema ab ha wui hab kaij.

REV07:4	I was told the number of those who were sealed: one hundred and forty-four thousand. Those who were sealed came from every tribe of the children of Israel:  	Kuni kah mash d siant giꞌikko wehst-mahm gamai giꞌik mihl (144,000) hegam mamt ha chepos heg hekaj Jiosh cheposidakud.

REV07:7	twelve thousand from the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand from the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand from the tribe of Issachar,  	Simeon, Levi, Issachar,  
REV07:8	twelve thousand from the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand from the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand from the tribe of Benjamin. 	Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin. 
REV07:9	After this I looked and saw a great crowd that nobody could count, made up of every nation, tribe, people and language. They were standing in front of the throne and the Lamb, dressed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands.  	Ntki hahawa ep ha nei moki am shaꞌi si geꞌe hemapig hab chuꞌig. Kuki pi ta kuintama idam hemajkam ch ab amjed g wehsko jejewed ch d nahnko mahs oꞌodham ch nahnko kaidam neneokdam. 
REV07:10	They gave a loud shout, “Salvation is from our God who sits on the throne, and from the Lamb.” 	ch si s-kaidam neneok ch hab kaij: 
REV07:11	All the angels surrounding the throne, and the elders and the four living creatures, fell down on their faces before the throne, worshipping God.  	Kuki wehsijj g anghil an ha wehgaj gegok ch am i shulig ch ab ihm g Jiosh ch hab ep kaij: 
REV07:13	One of the elders spoke to me and asked, “Who are those who are dressed in white robes, and where have they come from?”  	Tki hema hegam geꞌeged ab ni-kakke k hab kaij, “Dohꞌo wud idam hemajkam mo s-tohtam e enigadadch ch hebai amjed hihim?” 
REV07:14	I replied, “My Lord, you know the answer.” He told me, “These are the ones who have passed through great persecution. They washed their robes, making them white through the blood of the Lamb.  	Ni hab kaij ab wui, “Pi ani shaꞌi mahch. Ahpi ap wa s-mahch.” 
REV08:1	When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for around half an hour.  	Tki am hahawa wantsh k kuhpiꞌo g wewaꞌakkokam cheposig hegai mo kahwalkaj ab e chehgidch. Kuki gam hu wabsh i pi shahmuni an dahm kahchim ch ed am huꞌi eda hugkam ohla. 
REV08:2	I saw the seven angels that stand before God. They were given seven trumpets.  	Kuni haha wabsh ha neid hegam wewaꞌak anghil moki am gegok Jiosh tahgio. Mtki idam ab i ha mahkhi g wewaꞌak kukuikud. 
REV08:3	Then another angel came and stood at  the altar. He had a golden censer and he was given a large quantity of incense to add to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar that stands in front of the throne.  	Kuki am kehk g iagchulidakud kownal daikud baꞌich. Tki heg wui am hema ep jiwia g anghil k g ohla haꞌa uꞌa. Kumtki am eda geꞌe toꞌi g s-ap uhwchu mat ab wo i wehnad g ha-hoꞌigeꞌidalig g Jiosh hemajkamga k am wo iagchul Jiosh wui.

REV08:5	The angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it down upon the earth; there was the sound of thunder, with lightning flashes, and a terrible earthquake.  	Tki am hahawa bei g mehi ab amjed g iagchulidakud heg hekaj ohla haꞌa k am iawua jewed dahm. Kutki am shaꞌi si kop g tataniki k si s-kaidag. Kuki g wepgi an tohonnod ch g jewed si uꞌugij. 
REV08:6	Then the seven angels holding the seven trumpets prepared to blow them. 	Tki hegam wewaꞌak anghil mo uꞌa g wewaꞌak kukuikud am i e nako mat wo ku. 
REV08:7	The first angel blew his trumpet. Hail and fire mixed with blood rained down on the earth. One third of the earth was burned up, one third of the trees were burned up and all the green grass was burned up. 	Tki g wehpeg anghil am si kuhu g e-kuikudkaj.

REV08:8	The second angel blew his trumpet. Something looking like a huge mountain of flaming fire was thrown into the sea. One third of the sea turned to blood,  	Tki g gokkokam anghil am hahawa epai kuhu g e-kuikudkaj. Tki am haꞌichu e daꞌich ge shuhdagi ch ed ch hab sha mahs mo g ge geꞌe doꞌag ch meihim. Tki hemako tahpani mo waik e tahpanch g ge shuhdagi wabsh e ehꞌedch.

REV08:10	The third angel blew his trumpet. A great star fell from heaven, blazing brightly. It fell on a third of the rivers and springs of water.  	Tki g waikkokam anghil am hahawa ep ku. Tki g geꞌe huꞌu ab i gei dahm kahchim t amjed k hab masma meihim mo g kuhchki ch maꞌish g hemako tahpani mo waik e tahpanch g aꞌakimel ch shohshonkam shuhdagi.  
REV08:11	The name of the star is Wormwood, and one third of the water turned bitter,  and many people died from drinking the water because it had become poisonous. 	K hab chehgig ihda huꞌu S-siwkam. Kutki g hemako tahpani mo waik e tahpanch g shuhdagi wabsh ge siwa. Tki muꞌi hemajkam koi chum iꞌik ihda shuhdagi no pi si s-siw. 
REV08:12	The fourth angel blew his trumpet. One third of the sun, moon, and stars were struck so a third of them would be darkened, and a third part of the day would not give light, similarly the night. 	Tki g giꞌikkokam anghil am hahawa epai kuhu g e-kuikudkaj. Kutki g hemako tahpani mo waik e tahpanch g tash ch mashad ch huhuꞌu ge chuku. Kutki heg hekaj haꞌas huhug g ha-tonlig ch haꞌas tash pi tonod tash oidam ch chuhug oidam. 
REV08:13	I saw and heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven, shouting loudly, “Disaster, disaster, disaster is coming to those who live on the earth because of what is going to happen when the three remaining angels blow their trumpets.” 	Nt am hahawa ep i nen k kah. Kuki si s-kaidam hab kaij g baꞌag an uhgk daꞌadch, “Eh, si s-ta ehbidama!

REV09:1	The fifth angel blew his trumpet. I watched a star fall from heaven to earth. He  was given the key to the opening of the Abyss. 	Tki am hahawa ep kuhu g hetaspokam anghil g e-kuikudkaj. Kuni neid g huꞌu. Tki id am gei jewed dahm ab dahm kahchim t amjed. Kumtki ab mah hegai yahwi mo heg d wuikam wag mo pi hebai hug.  
REV09:2	He opened the entrance to the Abyss, and smoke came up out of the Abyss like the smoke of a huge furnace. The sun and the atmosphere became dark because of the smoke from the Abyss.  	Kutki ihda huꞌu am kuhpiꞌo hegai wag. Tki g kuhbs hab masma ab i wuhsh mo ab amjed g si geꞌe nahdakud. Kutki g tash tonlig wabsh wehsko chuku heg hekaj kuhbs ab amjed g wag.  
REV09:3	Locusts came out of the smoke onto the earth, and they were given power like that possessed by scorpions.  	Tki g geꞌeged shoshꞌo ab i huhud amjed g kuhbs an dahm g jewed. Kumtki ab ha mah g gewkdag mat s-koꞌokam wo ha juh hab masma mo g nanakshel.  
REV09:4	They were told not to harm the grass or any vegetation or any trees, only those who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.  	Kum hab ha ahg mat pi wo koꞌokam has juh g washai ch kukui ch wehs haꞌichu wuhshanig. Hegam atsh wo waꞌi s-koꞌokam has ha juh hemajkam mo pi ab hu cheposidas e-koka ab heg hekaj Jiosh cheposidakud.  
REV09:5	They were not allowed to kill, but they could torture these people for five months. The torture was like that of a scorpion when it stings someone. 	Kumtki pi ha hiwigi idam shoshꞌo mat wo ha kokda idam hemajkam k wabshaba wabsh wo s-koꞌokam ha shoꞌigch hetasp mashad ab. Kuki g s-koꞌok ab amjed g ha-shoꞌigchuda hab masma s-koꞌok mo g nakshel keꞌi.  
REV09:6	During that time people will look for death, but won't find it; they will want to die, but death will run away from them!  	Kutki heg oidam hetasp mashad idam hemajkam wo chum si s-koꞌim k wabshaba pi wo koi. 
REV09:7	The locusts looked like war-horses. They wore what seemed to be golden crowns on their heads, and their faces looked human.  	Kuki idam shoshꞌo hab mams mo hegam kakawyu mo e hekaj am cheggiadag ch ed. Kuki g ha-mohmi hab mams mo g uꞌuwi ha-mohmi. K an ha-mohmi an wahpkch g ohla gigiko.

REV09:9	Their breastplates looked like they were made of iron, and the noise made by their wings sounded like many horses and chariots racing into battle.  	Kuki g ha-babsho ab haꞌichukaj mamꞌaishch mo hab sha mams mo g wainomi koktoni. K g ha-aꞌan hab sha kaidag mo g muꞌi cheggiakud kakalit an wohpo mat wo ha cheggia.  
REV09:10	They had tails like scorpions, complete with stingers. They had the power to hurt people for five months with their tails.  	Kuki g ha-bahbhai ch ha-uꞌush hab mams mo g nanakshel ha-uꞌush. K g e-bahbhaikaj e nakog mat wo s-koꞌokam has ha juh g hemajkam hetasp mashad ab.  
REV09:11	Ruling over them as their king was the angel of the Abyss who is called Abaddon in Hebrew and Apollyon in Greek. 	Kuki ep ge kownalig. K id am ha wanimed ch d hegai anghil mo nuhkud g s-juhk wag ch hab chehgig am t-neꞌoki ed Abbadon k ch am Greek ha-neꞌoki ed hab chehgig Apollyon. K id hab d ahga Haꞌichu Padchuddam.

REV09:13	The sixth angel blew his trumpet. I heard a voice come from the horns of the golden altar that stands in front of God  	Tki g chuhdpokam anghil am hahawa epai kuhu g e-kuikudkaj. Kuni kah mo ab hema neok ab chuhchpulij amjed hegai ohla iagchulidakud mo am kehk baꞌich g Jiosh.

REV09:15	The four angels who had been kept ready for this particular hour, day, month and year were released to kill one third of humanity.  	Mtki am i ha dagito idam giꞌik anghil. Idam oki wa e nahtokch id si wehhejed ohla id si tash ed id si mashad ab ch id si ahidag ed mat wo ha kokda g hemako tahpani mo waik e tahpanch wehs hemajkam.  
REV09:16	I was told the number of the army of soldiers on horseback: it was 200 million. 	Kum am ni-ahgid mash d gohk siant mi-yohn (200,000,000) idam mo g kakawyu ha chehchejch. 
REV09:17	In my vision I saw the horses and their riders who wore breastplates as red as fire, and dark blue and yellow. The heads of the horses looked like lions, and fire and smoke and sulfur streamed out of their mouths. 	Kuni am ni-tahgio neid g kakawyu ch hegam mo ha chehchejch. Kuki g ha-wainomi koktoni si s-wepegi ch ep s-oꞌam ch hab masma s-chehedagi mo g dahm kahchim. K g kakawyu ha-mohmi hab mams mo g maipid ha-mohmi. K ab ha-chihchini amjed ab i wuhshani g mei ch kuhbs ch s-uam uhw.  
REV09:18	One third of humanity was killed by these three plagues, by the fire and smoke and sulfur streaming out of their mouths.  	Tki g hemako tahpani mo waik e tahpanch g hemajkam e koꞌij id hekaj waik haꞌichu mo ab wuhshani ha-chihchini amjed.  
REV09:19	The horses' power was in their tails as well as their mouths, for their tails were like snakes' heads that they used to hurt people. 	Kuki idam kakawyu hab waꞌap s-gewpkdag am ha bahbhai am. Ha-bahbhai oki hab mams mo g kohkꞌoi ch ab ge mohmi. K id hekaj s-koꞌokam has ha wua. 
REV09:20	But the rest of humanity who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of what they were doing. They did not stop worshiping demons and idols of gold, silver, bronze, and stone—which can't see or hear or walk!  	Kutki wabshaba hegam hemajkam mat an wih pi gam hu s-ohhod g pi ap e-chuꞌijig k ab wabsh kia ha ihm g jijawul ch ab ep ha ihm g e-jijoshchuda. Kuki eda ihda pi am hu haꞌichu d i ha-wehmtadag.

REV10:1	Then I saw another powerful angel descending from heaven, with a cloud wrapped around him and with a rainbow over his head. His face looked like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.  	Ntki hahawa ab nei matki ab hema i hud g s-gewk anghil ab dahm kahchim amjed. Id oki g chewagikaj e enigadadch ch g kiohod an hab juhkch e-moꞌo an. Kuki g wuhioshaj hab mahs mo g tash. K g kakhioj hab mahs mo g mehi am wuhshanim.  
REV10:2	He was holding a small scroll that had already been opened. He placed his right foot on the sea, and this left foot on the land.  	Id oki g s-apko e-tadkaj am keishch g ge shuhdagi ch g s-ohgig e-tadkaj am keishch g jewed. Kuki an hab chuꞌig g oꞌohana nowij ed ch pi holiwkas.  
REV10:3	He gave a great shout, like a lion roaring. When he shouted, the seven thunders responded.  	Kuki am si s-kaidam neok ch hab sha kaidag mo g mawid ab todk. Kutki g wewaꞌak tataniki ab hahawa uhpam neneo todkch.  
REV10:4	When the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write down what they said when I heard a voice from heaven that told me, “Keep under seal what the seven thunders said. Don't write them down.”  	Nt am haha wabsh wo i chum oꞌoha. Tki wabshaba ab hema neo dahm kahchim t amjed k hab kaij, “Pi g am hedai shaꞌi ahgid mo has kaij idam wewaꞌak tataniki. Pi g an hu shaꞌi oꞌohan.” 
REV10:5	The angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land held up his right hand to heaven.  	Kutki ihda anghil mo an dahm kehk g ge kahchki ch jewed ab si uhgk i bei g s-apkojed e-nowi ab dahm kahchim wui  
REV10:6	He made a sacred oath by the One who lives for ever and ever, who created the heavens and everything in them, and the earth and everything in it, and the sea and everything in it. “No more delay!” he said.  	k hab kaij, “Jiosh o chum hekid an haꞌichug ch nahto g dahm kahchim ch jewed kahchim ch ge kahchki ch wehs haꞌichu mo am ha eda idam k hab kaij mat am wa e ai mat geꞌe haꞌichu hab wo e juh.  
REV10:7	But at the time when the seventh angel speaks, when he blows his trumpet, then the mystery of God will be completed—the good news he announced through his servants the prophets. 	Wewaꞌakkokam anghil at am wo kuhu g e-kuikudkaj. T am hab haha wo juh g Jiosh g s-aꞌagi e-apchuda mo wa am ha ahgid hegam e-pionagbad mo d Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam.” 
REV10:8	Then I heard again the voice from heaven telling me, “Go and take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel that stands on the sea and on the land.”  	Kutki hegai mo wa ab neok ni-wui ab dahm kahchim t amjed ab ep neok k hab kaij, “Neh, an o uꞌukch g oꞌohana hegai anghil mo an dahm kehk g kahchki ch jewed.

REV10:9	So I went to the angel, and asked him to give me the little scroll. He said to me, “Take it and eat it up. It will be sour in your stomach, but sweet as honey in your mouth.”  	Nt am hih wui hegai anghil k ab tahni mat wo ni-mah. 
REV10:10	I took the little scroll from the angel and ate it up. In my mouth it was as sweet as honey, but it was sour in my stomach.  	Nt ab bei g al oꞌohana nowij ab k huh. K s-wohom si s-iꞌowi mant huh. Nt wabshaba am i bah. T hahawa si siwa am ni-wohk ed.

REV11:1	I was given a measuring rod and told, “Get up and measure the Temple of God, and the altar, and count those who are worshiping there.  	Kumtki ab hahawa hema ni-mah g kuintakud uhs k hab ni-ahg, “I g wuhshani k an kuint g Jiosh cheopiga ch g iagchulidakud k wo ha kuint hegam mo am e hoꞌigeꞌidahun Jiosh wui amai.  
REV11:2	Don't measure the court outside the Temple, leave that, because it has been handed over to the nations. They will trample down the holy city for forty-two months.

REV11:6	These two witnesses have the power to close the sky so that it will not rain during the time of their prophecy. They also have the power to turn the waters into blood, and to strike the earth with all kinds of plagues, as often as they want.  	Ab oki mahks g apꞌedag mat wo kuh g dahm kahchim.

REV11:9	For three and a half days those from the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will look at their dead bodies, and will not allow their corpses to be buried.

Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven. 	Tki am waꞌi hekaj am si s-gewkam wo uꞌugij g jewed.

REV11:17	They said, “We thank you, O Lord God, the All-powerful One, who is and was, because you have taken up your great power and have asserted your rule.” 	ch hab kaij: 
REV11:19	Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of the covenant could be seen inside his Temple. There were lightning flashes, the sound of thunder, an earthquake, and a great hailstorm. 	Kutki g Jiosh cheopi an dahm kahchim ch ed ab i e kuhpiꞌo.

REV12:4	His tail swept away a third of the stars of heaven and threw them down to the earth. The dragon stood right in front of the woman who was giving birth, so that he could eat her child as soon as it was born. 	Kutki g e-baikaj i ha chewaim g hemako tahpani mo waik e tahpanch g huhuꞌu k im hu hab i ha juh ab dahm kahchim amjed ch am ha nehnich jewed dahm. Kutki wo mahmadho hegai uwi.

REV12:7-8	There was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought with the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought  but he was not strong enough, and they could no longer remain in heaven.

REV12:9	The great dragon, the ancient serpent called the Devil and Satan who deceives the whole world, was thrown down to the earth, and his angels with him.

REV12:10	Then I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, “Now salvation has come, and power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ. The Accuser of the believers has been thrown down—the one who accuses them in God's presence day and night.  	Ntki hahawa hema ep kah an dahm kahchim ch ed.

REV12:11	They conquered him through the blood of the Lamb and through their personal testimony—they did not love their lives so much that they were willing to die if necessary. 	“Jiosh si Kehsha at am i e dagito mat g ehꞌedaj e iagchul ab Jiosh wui. K g hemajkamgaj heg hekaj ab si hiwig ch s-ap ahgachug g wohokam ab amjed ch hab gehg g Jiawul, chum as hems wo e muhkid.  
REV12:12	So celebrate, heaven, and everyone who lives there! Mourn, earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you and is very angry, knowing his time is short.” 	T wo si s-hehgigk wehsijj hegam mo am haꞌichug Jiosh kihdag ed.

REV12:13	When the dragon realized he had been thrown down to the earth, he persecuted the woman that had given birth to the male child.  	Pegih, am amtki wa daꞌich jewed dahm ihda Nehbig Hujud mo d Jiawul. Tki wa eda heki hu madt hegai uwi. T g Nehbig Hujud an ha hekaj i huꞌui.  
REV12:14	The woman was given the wings of a large eagle so she could fly away to a deserted place where she could be looked after for a time, times, and half a time, protected from the serpent. 	Kumtki ab aꞌanch g uwi g baꞌag aꞌankaj mat gam hu wo daꞌa k gan hu wo e ehstokch tohono jewed ch ed. Kumtki am wo nuhkudad waik eda hugkam aꞌahidag mat g Nehbig Hujud pi wo mua.

REV12:16	The earth came to the woman's aid by opening its mouth and swallowing up the river that the dragon spewed out of his mouth.  	Tki wabshaba g jewed ab i wehmt g uwi, heg wa wepo mat ab i kuhpiꞌo g e-chini k im hu bah hegai shuhdagi mo ab daꞌiwuni Nehbig Hujud chini amjed.  
REV12:17	The dragon was furious with the woman, and went off to attack the rest of her offspring, those who keep God's commandments and have the testimony of Jesus.  	Tki haha wabsh wohoꞌi bagat g Nehbig Hujud ab wui g uwi k amjed am i ha cheggia hegam mo ab d amjedkamaj.

REV12:18	  	Kuki am hahawa kehk g Nehbig Hujud ge shuhdagi koa an. 
REV13:1	And the dragon stood on the sea shore. Then I saw a beast rising out of the sea. He had ten horns and seven heads, with ten small crowns on his horns, and had blasphemous names on his heads.  	Ntki haha wabsh nei hegai s-ta Ehbidamakam oꞌodham mo e wepogidch g mischini haꞌichu doakam. Id at ab i wuhsh ge shuhdagi t amjed k ge wehst-mahm aꞌag ch wewaꞌak mohmi.

REV13:2	The beast I saw looked like a leopard, but his feet looked like those of a bear, and his mouth looked like that of a lion. The dragon gave the beast his power, his throne, and great authority.  	Ihda s-ta Ehbidamakam oki hab sha mahs mo g ohshod. K g tahtdaj hab sha mams mo g judumi tahtad. K g chinij hab mahs mo g mawid chini. T g Nehbig Hujud ab mah g gewkdag ch e-kownaltalig wehs jewed dahm.  
REV13:3	One of his heads seemed to have suffered a death-blow, but this fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was filled with wonder at the beast,  	Hema g moꞌoj o hab sha mahs matki wa e muhkid k wabshaba ep doa k e chegito.

REV13:4	and they worshiped the dragon because he had given his authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, asking “Who is like the beast? Who could defeat him?”  	k ab ep ihm g s-ta Ehbidamakam ch hab kaij, “Pi oki hedai hab shaꞌi masma mo ihda. Pi atki hedai wo shaꞌi e nako mat wo cheggia.” 
REV13:5	He was given the ability  to make great boasts and speak blasphemies, and he was also given the authority to do this for forty-two months.  	Kum wabsh hiwgid ihda mat wo si pi kehg neokad. Kumtki ab ep mah g gewkdag am oidam g giꞌikko wehst-mahm gamai gohk (42) mashad.

REV13:7	The beast was given power to attack believers and defeat them, and he was also given authority over every people, tribe, language, and nation.  	Ab amtki hiwigi mat wo ha cheggia g Jiosh hemajkamga k wo ha gewito. Kumt ab ep mah g gewkdag am ha dahm g wehsko dakam hemajkam mo has i kaidam d neneokdam.  
REV13:8	Everybody living on earth will worship him, those whose names had not been written in the book of life—the book of life that belongs to the Lamb slain from the beginning of the world.  	K wabshaba g Jiosh hemajkamga ha chechgig o an oꞌohadag e doꞌibiakam ha-oꞌohana ed. Ihda oꞌohana o d enigaj hegai mat kahwalkaj e muhkid am ha wehhejed.

REV13:9	If you have ears, listen!  	Am g wo s-ap i aꞌamichud ihda.  
REV13:10	Anyone who has to go into captivity will go into captivity; anyone who has to die by the sword will die by the sword. This demonstrates the patient endurance and confidence in God of the believers. 	Hegam mo hedai d ha wuikam mat wo e kuhpach at hemho wa wo e kuhpach. Hegam mo d ha wuikam mat wo e koꞌij at hemho wa wo e koꞌij. K eda d ha-wuikam g Jiosh hemajkamga mat wo s-chu nakogad ch wo s-gewkk am e-wohochudadag ed. 
REV13:11	Then I saw another beast, rising up from the earth. He had two horns like a lamb, but he spoke like a dragon.  	Ni hahawa ep neid matki ab hema ep i wuhsh ged hu jewed wecho amjed.

REV13:12	He imposed the same authority as the first beast on his behalf, and made the earth and those who live there worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed.

K heg ab wehs ha chehani g hemajkam jewed dahm mat ab wo si has elidad hegai wehpeg s-ta Ehbidamakam matki uhpam e chegito.  
REV13:13-14	He performed great miracles, even bringing fire down from heaven to earth while people watched.  He deceived those who live on the earth by the miracles he performed on behalf of the beast, ordering the people that they should make an image for the beast who had received the fatal sword wound but came back to life.

REV13:15	He was permitted to breathe life into the image of the beast so that it could speak, ordering anyone who did not worship it put to death.  	Hegai s-chu Iattomakam Haꞌichu i Tashogiddam atki am ihbheiwua id eda mat am e nahto. Tki heg hekaj e nako ihda haꞌichu ha-nahtoi mat wo neok k ep wo ha kokda wehs hegam mat pi ab hu wo i shul wui.  
REV13:16	He made everyone, whether weak or powerful, rich or poor, free or slave, receive a mark on their right hand or on their foreheads.

Kumtki wa woho an ge ha chechpos an s-apkojed ha-nohnhoi an ch ab ha-koka ab.  
REV13:17	Nobody was permitted to buy or sell except those who had the mark, which was the name of the beast or the number of his name. 	Pi atki hedai wo e nako mas haꞌichu wo ha nolawt o haꞌichu wo gagda, heg hi wa mat ab wo cheposigk g s-ta Ehbidamakam chehgigkaj o heg hekaj nuhmilo mo d chehgigaj nuhmilo. 
REV13:18	Wisdom is needed here. Whoever has understanding should calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. His number is 666. 	Id oki d si s-juhk haꞌichu. Kut am wo i mamche matp hedai wo s-chu amichudad mo has d ahga hegai s-ta Ehbidamakam nuhmilo no pi hegai nuhmilo d chehgigaj hema oꞌodham. K ihda nuhmilo d chuhdp siant chuhdpo gamai chuhdp (666).

REV14:3	They sang a new song in front of the throne and the four living creatures and the elders. Nobody could learn the song except the 144,000, those who had been redeemed from the earth.  	Hegam hemajkam mani wa ha neid oki am ahg g wechij neꞌi ch am gegok wui hegai kownal daikud ch hegam ha wui giꞌik haꞌichu doakam ch hegam geꞌeged. Kutki pi hedai ep wo e nako mas wo mai g ha-nei.  
REV14:4	They have not become morally impure by sinning with women; spiritually they are virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were redeemed from humankind as the firstfruits to God and the Lamb.  	Idam oki d hegam mat pi shaꞌi ha hohont k si e nuhkud mo pi ha wehm wohppo.

REV14:5	They speak no lies; they are without fault. 	Pi oki hekid haꞌichu ha iattogid ch pi ha chuꞌijig. 
REV14:6	Then I saw another angel flying in mid-heaven. He had the eternal good news to announce to those who lived on the earth, to every nation, tribe, language, and people.

Worship the One who made heaven and earth and sea and springs of water.” 	Si o s-kaidam hab kaij, “Ab g wo si has elid g Jiosh ch ab ihm. E at ai mat wo ha lodai g hemajkam. Ab g wo i tohtonwua k ab wo i ihm g Jiosh. Heg at nahto g dahm kahchim ch jewed ch ge shuhdagi ch g shohshonkam shuhdagi.” 
REV14:8	A second angel followed, calling out, “Babylon the great has collapsed into ruins! She made all the nations drink the wine of her sexual immorality that brings God's furious opposition.” 	Tki am hahawa hema ep i oi hegai wehpeg anghil k hab kaij, “I at gei ihda geꞌe kihhim.

REV14:9-10	A third angel followed the first two, and cried out in a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on their forehead or on their hand,  they will also drink of the wine of God's furious opposition that is poured undiluted into the cup of his anger,  and they will suffer anguish in fire and burning sulfur before the holy angels and the Lamb.

REV14:11	The smoke of their anguish ascends for ever and ever.

REV14:12	This means the believers must patiently endure, keeping God's commandments and trusting in Jesus. 	Id att hekaj hemho wo wa si s-chu nakogad ahchim mach d Jiosh hemajkamga ch ab s-wohog elid g Jiosh chehanig ch am s-gewkam oid g Jesus. 
REV14:13	Then I heard a voice from heaven that told me, “Write this down! Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Yes, says the Spirit, because they can rest from their troubles. What they have accomplished will speak for them.” 	Ni hahawa hema ep kah.

REV14:14	I looked and I saw a white cloud. Sitting on the cloud was someone that looked like the Son of man, wearing a golden crown on his head and holding a sharp sickle in his hand.

REV14:18	He was followed by an angel coming from the altar that was in charge of the fire, who called in a loud voice to the angel with the sharp sickle, “Take your sharp sickle and harvest the bunches of grapes from the earth's vine, because its grapes are ripe.”  	K am hema ep kehk g anghil ch am nuhkud g nahda ab ab g iagchulidakud.

REV14:20	They were trampled in the winepress outside the city. Blood flowed out of the winepress to the height of a horse's bridle, and to a distance of 1,600 stadia.

REV17:3	Then he carried me off in the Spirit to a deserted place, and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that had seven heads and ten horns and was covered in blasphemous names.

REV17:4	The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and wore jewelry made of gold and gems and pearls. She held in her hand a golden cup full of obscene things and her disgusting immorality.  	Ihda uwi o si s-ihbhaimagim ch s-wegima e enigadadch ch g ohlakaj ch s-kehg hohodaikaj e hehosidch. K an nowij ed hab chuꞌig g ohla tahsa ch shuhdags g si s-uam haꞌichu.

K id s-aꞌagi has d ahga ch hab chuꞌig, “Si Geꞌe Babylon kihhim o hab sha masma mo d ha-jeꞌe g wehs chechpaꞌawi ch totonto id dahm jewed.”  
REV17:6	I saw that the woman was drunk on the blood of believers, and on the blood of martyrs who had died for Jesus. When I saw her, I was totally amazed. 	Neid ani mat shaꞌi si s-ap e taht ihda uwi mat e koꞌij hegam mat pi dagito g Jesus. Heg o wa wepo mat nawm iꞌok g ha-ehꞌed. 
REV17:7	The angel asked me, “Why were you amazed? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and the beast she rode which has seven heads and ten horns.  	K ab ni-kakke g anghil ch hab kaij, “Shahchu apt ahgk si has e taht. Am ant wo m-ahgi mo has d ahga ihda map s-neidma.  
REV17:8	The beast you saw once was but is not, however will soon come up again out of the Abyss, and will then be completely destroyed. Those that live on the earth who don't have their names written in the book of life will be amazed when they see the beast that once was but is not, and yet shall return.

REV17:9	A mind that has understanding is needed here. The seven heads are seven hills where the woman sits, 	“K d ha-wuikam g Jiosh hemajkamga mat wo s-amich ihda. Hegam wewaꞌak mohmi o d wewaꞌak kaꞌakwulk. K idam ha dahm daha ihda uwi. Idam mohmi o d ep wewaꞌak kokownal.

REV17:12	The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not begun to reign yet. However they will be given authority to reign as kings together with the beast for one hour.  	“Hegam wehst-mahm aꞌag map neid o hab d ahga mat wehst-mahm kokownal ab ep wo i wuwha.

K hab ep kaij g anghil ab ni-wui, “Am ap neid mo ihda uwi am muꞌi ha dahm daha g ge shuhshugi. K id hab d ahga mat g geꞌe pi apꞌekam kihhim am wo dahmkad muꞌi jejewed ch muꞌi nahnko mahs hemajkam.  
REV17:16-17	The ten horns that you saw and the beast will detest the prostitute, and will take away everything she has and strip her naked, eat her flesh and burn her to ashes. For God put into their minds to do what he wanted, to have one agreed purpose: to give their kingdom to the beast—and so God's words will be fulfilled.

REV19:20	The beast was captured, along with the false prophet who performed miracles in his presence (by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped the beast's image). Both of them were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.  	Kumt bei hegai s-ta Ehbidamakam ch heg ehp s-chu Iattomkam Haꞌichu i Tashogiddam.

REV20:3	The angel threw him into the Abyss and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he would no longer be able to deceive the nations until the thousand years were over. After that he has to be set free for a little while. 	k am daꞌich heg eda s-juhk wag k ab si yahwidad k ab ep si bidsh.

REV20:4	I saw people sitting on thrones who had been given the responsibility to judge, and the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony about Jesus and for sharing the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or his image, nor had they received the mark on their foreheads or their hands. They lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.

REV20:5-6	This is the first resurrection. (The rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years had ended.)  Blessed and holy are those who take part in the first resurrection! The second death has no power over them. They will be priests of God, and of Christ, and they will reign with him for one thousand years.

REV20:10	The devil, who had deceived them, was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet had also been thrown, and they will suffer in anguish day and night for ever and ever.

REV20:12	I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and the books were opened. Another book, the Book of Life, was opened and the dead were judged based on what was written in the books about what they had done.  	Kuni ha neid hegam mo d koꞌi ch d nahnko i mahs hemajkam.

REV20:13	The sea handed over the dead in it, and death and Hades handed over the dead that were in them, and everyone was judged according to what they had done.

REV20:14-15	Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The lake of fire is the second death.  Anyone whose name was not found written in the book of life was thrown into the lake of fire. 	Pi o an hu oꞌohanas g ha-chechgig heg eda oꞌohana mo an oꞌohanas g e doꞌibiakam ha-chechgig.

REV21:3	I heard a loud voice from the throne say, “Now God's home  is with human beings and he will live with them. They will be his people. God himself will be with them as their God. 	Ab o daha g Jiosh e-kownal daikud ab. Kuni kah mo hab kaij, “Idani at g ni-kihdag ia i hud ha wui g hemajkam. Am ant ha wehm wo kihkad. Kut d wo ni-hemajkamgak.

REV21:5	The One who sits on the throne said, “I am making everything new!” He told me, “Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true.”  	Neh, bo kaij g Jiosh ch amjed hab ep kaij, “Idani ant am hahawa si wechij nahto wehs haꞌichu,” ch hab ep kaij ab ni-wui, “An g oꞌohan ihda wohokam mani m-ahgid.

REV21:6	Then he said to me, “Everything's done! I am the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. To anyone who is thirsty I will give the free gift of water from the spring of the water of life.  	K hab ep kaij, “E at nahto wehs haꞌichu. Ahni ani d alpha ch d omega.

REV21:8	But anyone who is a coward, who doesn't trust me, who does disgusting things, who is a murderer, who is sexually immoral, who practices witchcraft, who worships idols, who tells lies—their chosen place is in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur. This is the second death.” 	T wabshaba wo e nehnich mei kahchki ch ed g s-chu ehbidkam ch pi wohochuddam ch hegam mo loligog ch chum e uꞌuwichud o chum e chechojchud ch ha muꞌadkam ch totonto ch s-chu hihoinkam ch s-chu iꞌattomkam ch hegam mo wabsh g oꞌodham nahtoi ha jijoshchud.

REV21:9	One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls containing the seven last plagues came and spoke to me. He told me, “Come with me. I will show you the bride, the Lamb's wife.” 	Hema hegam wewaꞌak anghil mat am uꞌapa g si oidchkam shoꞌigdag at am jiwia ni-wui k hab kaij, “Ab g i hihm.

REV21:10	He took me in the Spirit to the top of a very high mountain. There he showed me the holy city Jerusalem descending from God out of heaven,  	T g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag ab si i ni-wehmt.

ROM01:23-26	They exchanged the glory of the immortal God for idols, images of mortal human beings, birds, animals, and reptiles.  So God abandoned them to the evil desires of their depraved minds, and they did shameful, degrading things to each other.  They exchanged God's truth for a lie, worshiping and serving creatures instead of the Creator, who deserves praise forever. Amen. That's why God abandoned them to their evil desires. Their women exchanged natural sex for that which is unnatural,  	Jiosh o d pi ha huhugedam ch d si haꞌichu. Kutt heg ab wo waꞌi chum ihmad mo d t‑Jioshga.

ROM02:29	What makes you a Jew is on the inside, a “circumcision of the heart” that doesn't follow the letter of the law but the Spirit. Someone like that is looking for praise from God, not from people. 	Hegam o hi d Jiosh hemajkamga mat gawul juh g e‑ihbdag. Kut pi wo e nako mas g chehanigkaj hab wo juh ihda.

ROM03:25	God openly presented Jesus as the gift that brings peace to those trusting in him, the one who shed his blood. God did this to demonstrate he is truly right, for previously he would hold back and pass over sins,  	Jiosh at am i apꞌech mat g alidaj wo e muhkid am t‑wehhejed k hekaj gam hu hab wo i juh g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig mattp hedai ab wo i s‑wohoch.

ROM03:27-28	So do we have anything to boast about then? Absolutely not, there's no place for that! And why's that? Is it because we follow the law of observing requirements? No, we follow the law of trusting in God.  We conclude that people are made right with God through their trust in him, and not from legal observance.

Wehsijj at hab waꞌi masma wo i e apꞌech am Jiosh tahgio mat ab wo i s‑wohoch g haꞌichu ahgaj ab amjed g Jesus.  
ROM03:31	Does that mean that by trusting in God we do away with the law? Of course not! In fact we affirm the importance of the law. 	Id o pi hab d ahga machs im hu hab i juh g Jiosh chehanig matt hekid ab i s‑wohoch. T‑wohochudadag o am i t‑gewpkad matt am hab wo junihid g tatchuij mo hab wa chum d ahga g chehanigaj. 
ROM04:1	Let's take Abraham as an example. From a human viewpoint he is the father of our nation. Let's ask, “What was his experience?”  	Am ant wo i wuhshad g Abrahambad mant am wo i em‑tashogi ihda mani wa em‑ahgid. Ihda Abrahambad ash d t‑shohshon ahchim Tutuligo  
ROM04:2	For if Abraham was set right by what he did, he would have had something to boast about—but not in God's eyes.  	ch ab i s‑wohoch g Jiosh. Tsh g Jiosh heg hekaj am i apꞌech e tahgio. Pi atsh wa hejel am i e apꞌech heg hekaj mas hab junihim g s‑apꞌekam. K heg hekaj wa pi am hu haꞌichu d shaꞌi hegai matsh wa heg hekaj wo chum si e haschudad g Abrahambad.  
ROM04:3	However what does Scripture say? “Abraham trusted God, and so he was considered as being right.”  	An o hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed: 
ROM04:9	Now is this blessing just for the Jews, or is it for others too? We've just stated that Abraham was accepted as right because he trusted God.  	David o pi hegam hab waꞌi ha ahg mo pahl hikuchkas ch wabshaba hegam hab ep ha ahg mo pi pahl hikuchkas. Heki ani hu ahg matsh g Abrahambad ab i s‑wohoch g Jiosh.

ROM04:10	But when did this happen? When Abraham was a Jew or before?  	Id at hab e juh mat koi e pahl hikuch g Abrahambad.  
ROM04:11-12	It was actually before he became a Jew by being circumcised, which was a confirmation of his trust in God to make him right. This happened before he was circumcised, so he is the father of everyone who trusts in God and are considered as right by God, even though they may not be circumcised Jews.  He is also the father of circumcised Jews not merely because they're circumcised, but because they follow the example of the trust in God our father Abraham had before he was circumcised. 	Ab ash wa s‑wohochud g Jiosh. Sh g Jiosh heg hekaj hab kaij mo d s‑apꞌekam. T heg i dahm am hahawa e pahl hikuch mat hab masma am wo wohokamch g e‑wohochudadag mat heg hekaj am i apꞌech g Jiosh.

ROM04:13	God's promise to Abraham and his descendants that the world would belong to him was not based on his keeping of the law, but because he was made right through his trust in God.  	Jiosh ah am ha ahgid g Abrahambad ch amjedkamaj matsh am wo i ha apꞌech e tahgio k wehs ab wo ha mah g jewed kahchki matp ab wo i s‑wohoch.  
ROM04:14	For if the promised inheritance is based on keeping the law, then the issue of trusting God is not necessary, and the promise is pointless.  	Kut pi haꞌichu wehhejed wo s‑kehgajk g ha‑wohochudadag matp id hab wo sha ha juni g Jiosh hegam mo pi ab hu wohochud ch am hab wabsh junihim hegai mo an oꞌohanas chehanig ed. T g Jiosh d wo s‑iattomkamk matp am hab wo sha ha juni.  
ROM04:15	For the law results in punishment but if there's no law then it cannot be broken. 	Pi att ab hu wo shaꞌi i t‑apꞌech g chehanigkaj k wabshaba heg hekaj ab wo t‑abch g t‑chuꞌijig matt ab wo bei g s‑koꞌok t‑namkidadag. T hegam mo pi edgid pi heg hekaj ab hu wo e abch. 
ROM04:16	So the promise is based on trusting God. It is provided as a free gift, guaranteed to all the children of Abraham—not merely to those who follow the law,  but also to those who trust like Abraham, the father of us all.  	Pi at ahchim am waꞌi i t‑apꞌech g Jiosh mach wa an uꞌukch g heki hu chehanigaj. Ahpim at am ep i em‑apꞌech mamt hab waꞌap ab i s‑wohoch g haꞌichu ahgaj.

ROM04:17	As Scripture says, “I've made you the father of many nations.” For in the presence of God, Abraham trusted in the God who makes the dead alive and speaks into existence what didn't previously exist.  	Bo masma an oꞌohadag mash g Jiosh am ahgid g Abrahambad: 
ROM05:1	Now that we have been made right by God by trusting in him, we have peace with him through our Lord Jesus Christ.  	Am at i t‑apꞌech g Jiosh e tahgio ahchim matt ab i s‑wohoch g haꞌichu ahgaj ab amjed g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ. Kuch heg hekaj ab wui si s‑ap t‑tahtk.  
ROM05:2	It's through Jesus, trusting in him, that we've gained access to this position of grace where we now stand, looking forward with happiness and confidence to sharing in God's glory.  	Shoꞌo waꞌi si s‑hemajima a t‑wui. Kuch si s‑hehgig ch ab nenida mat ab wo i t‑wahpki e‑kihdag ed k ab wo si t‑haꞌichuch.  
ROM05:3	Not only this—we also remain confident when problems come, because we know that experiencing problems develops spiritual stamina. 	Chum as haꞌichu t‑kudut, ch eda si s‑hehgig nach pi s‑mahch mo g t‑kudutadag hab t‑wua matt wo s‑chu nakogad.  
ROM05:4	Spiritual stamina in turn develops a mature character, and this mature character results in confident hope.  	T g Jiosh s‑ap wo i t‑el mach s‑chu nakog. Kutt id hekaj am wo i t‑gewpkai heg wui mach ab nenida.  
ROM05:5	Since we have this hope we're never disappointed, for God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit he's given us.  	Ab at i t‑mah g Jiosh g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. K heg ab t‑mahtchulid mo si pihk e elid g Jiosh ab t‑wui. Ch hekaj s‑mahch mat woho am wo i t‑wahpki g Jiosh e‑kihdag ed.

ROM05:8	But God demonstrates his love for us in that Christ died for us while we were still sinners. 	Kuch eda d wa chum pi ap chuꞌijkam. T g Jiosh am t‑chehgi mo heꞌes ab si i t‑tatchua am i apꞌechudk mat g alidaj am t‑wehhejed muh k gam hu hab i juh g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig.  
ROM05:9	Now that we are made right by his death, we can be absolutely sure we'll be saved by him from the coming judgment.  	Kuch hab s‑mahch mat hahawa pi heg hekaj ab hu wo t‑namkid.  
ROM05:10	While we were his enemies, God made us his friends through the death of his Son, and so we can be absolutely sure that he will save us through the life of his Son.  	Heki ach hu pi ab hu hajunima g Jiosh. T g alidaj muh am t‑wehhejed mat hab wo t‑juh matt ab haha wo hajunit g Jiosh.

ROM05:12-14	For through one man sin entered the world, and sin led to death. In this way death came to everyone, for everyone sinned.  Even before the law was given, sin was in the world, however it wasn't counted as sin because there was no law.  But death still ruled from Adam until Moses, even over those who didn't sin in the same way as Adam did. 	Ab atsh haꞌichu cheha g Jiosh hegai mo d wehpeg oꞌodham ch hab chehgig Adam. Tsh heg mulin k hab i shonwuich g pi apꞌekam jewed dahm. Tsh hekaj am i shonwua muhkig. Tsh g Jiosh pi hab ep juh g chehanig am hugkam matsh an i wuhsh g Mosesbad.

ROM05:15	But the gift of Jesus is not like the sin of Adam. Though many people died because of one man's sin, God's grace is so much greater and has been shared with so many through his gracious gift in the person of Jesus Christ.  	Wehsijj atsh ab haꞌichu i wahpki am wehs ha wehhejed g hemajkam. K wabshaba gawul mams hegai mat ab i wahpki. Do muhkig hegai matsh g Adambad ab i wahki wehs ha wehhejed g hemajkam. K wabshaba d Jiosh hemajimatalig hegai matsh g Jesus Christ ab i wahki wehs t‑wehhejed.  
ROM05:16	The result of the gift is not like that of the sin. The result of Adam's sin was judgment and condemnation, but the gift sets us right with God, despite our many sins.  	K d al hemako hegai chuꞌijig mat hekaj am i wah g s‑koꞌok namkidadag. K wabshaba muꞌij g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig. K eda g Jiosh wehs gam hu hab i junihog am t‑wehhejed.

ROM05:17	As a result of one man's sin, death ruled because of him. But God's grace is so much greater and his gift sets us right, for everyone who receives it will rule in life through the person of Jesus Christ!  	Muhkig at ab wehsijj t‑maꞌish heg hekaj.

ROM05:18	Just as one sin brought condemnation on everyone, in the same way one right act gave everyone the opportunity to live right.

ROM05:19	Just as through one man's disobedience many became sinners, in the same way through one man's obedience many are made right with God.  	Adambad at pi wohog el g Jiosh. K heg hekaj muꞌijj d pi ap chuꞌijkam. Christ at hejel ab s‑wohog el g Jiosh. Kut heg hekaj muꞌijj ab wo i e apꞌech am Jiosh tahgio. 
ROM05:20	When the law was introduced, sin became even more obvious. But while sin became much more obvious, grace became even more obvious!

ROM06:16	Don't you realize that if you make yourselves someone's slaves, obeying their orders, then you are slaves to the one you obey? If you are slaves of sin, the result is death; if you obey God, the result is you are made right with him.  	T wabshaba g pi apꞌekam an wo ha uꞌukchid matp hab wo junihid.

ROM06:19	I'm using this everyday example because your human thinking is limited.

ROM07:2-3	For example, a married woman is bound by the law to her husband while he's alive, but if he dies, she's released from this legal obligation to him.  So if she lives with another man while her husband is alive, she would be committing adultery. However, if her husband dies and then she marries another man, she wouldn't be guilty of adultery.

ROM07:6	But now we've been set free from the law, and have died to what kept us in chains, so that we can serve in the newness of the spirit and not the old letter of the law.

Ch hahawa woho chikpanid. 
ROM07:7	So what do we conclude? That the law is sin? Of course not! I wouldn't have known what sin was unless the law defined it. I wouldn't have realized that wanting to have other people's things for myself was wrong without the law that says, “Don't desire for yourself what belongs to someone else.”  	Haꞌi o hab elid mo pi apꞌe g Jiosh chehanig.

ROM07:10-11	I discovered that the very commandment that was meant to bring life brought death instead,  because sin found a way through the commandment to deceive me, and used the commandment to kill me! 	Jiosh at hab juh g e‑chehanig matt heg hekaj wo s‑mai matt has masma wo bei g s‑ap doakag. Kunid eda heg ab am cheh maniki d pi ap chuꞌijkam ch ab aihog g ni‑muhkig ch s‑koꞌok ni‑namkidadag.

ROM07:13	Now would something that is good kill me? Of course not! But sin shows itself to be sin by using good to cause my death. So by means of the commandment, it's revealed how evil sin really is.  	Pi at g chehanig hab ni‑juh mani ab aihog g ni‑muhkig ch s‑koꞌok ni‑namkidadag. Pi apꞌekam at hab ni‑juh mani wa ab aihog.

ROM07:24-25	I'm totally miserable! Who will rescue me from this body that's causing my death? Thank God—for he does this through Jesus Christ our Lord!  Here's the situation: while I myself choose with my mind to obey God's law, my human nature obeys the law of sin. 	Pegih, boki chuꞌig g t‑doakag mach eda pi ab hu hiwig g Jiosh.

ROM08:3	What the law couldn't do because it was powerless due to our sinful nature,  God was able to do! By sending his own Son in human form, God dealt with the whole problem of sin and destroyed sin's power in our sinful human nature.  	Pi att wo shaꞌi t‑nako machs am hu hab wo junihid g chehanig ch hekaj wo t‑doꞌibia nach pi d wabsh oꞌodham. T wabshaba g Jiosh am i kei g e‑alidag mat wo t‑doꞌibia.

ROM08:9	But you're not following your sinful nature, but the Spirit—if it's true that the Spirit of God is living in you. For those that don't have the Spirit of Christ in them don't belong to him.

ROM08:13	For if you live under the control of your sinful nature, you're going to die. But if you follow the way of the Spirit, putting to death the evil things you do, then you will live.

ROM08:15	You were not given a spirit to enslave and terrify you once more. No, what you received was the spirit that makes you children in God's family. Now we can shout out, “God is our Father!”  	ch ab ihm mo d t‑ohg ch pi shaꞌi ehbid.  
ROM08:16	The Spirit himself agrees with us that we're God's children.  	Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag o am t‑tashogid mach d aꞌaligaj g Jiosh.  
ROM08:17	If we're his children, then we're his heirs. We are heirs of God, and heirs together with Christ. But if we want to share in his glory we must share in his sufferings.

ROM08:20-21	For God allowed the purpose of creation to be frustrated.  But creation itself waits in hope for the time when it will be set free from the slavery of decay and share the glorious freedom of God's children.

ROM08:23	Not only creation, but we too, who have a foretaste of the Spirit, we groan inwardly as we wait for God to “adopt” us—the redemption of our bodies.

ROM08:26	Similarly the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We don't know how to speak with God, but the Spirit himself intercedes with and through us by groans that can't be put into words.

ROM09:4-5	They are my fellow-Israelites, God's chosen people. God revealed to them his glory and made agreements with them, giving them the law, true worship, and his promises.  They are our forefathers—ancestors of Christ, humanly-speaking, the One who rules over everything, the eternally-blessed God. Amen. 	Do chum Jiosh hemajkamga.

ROM11:15	If the result of God's rejection of them is that the world becomes God's friends, the result of God's acceptance of them would be like the dead coming back to life!

ROM11:16	If the first part of the bread dough given as an offering is holy, then so is all the rest; if the roots of a tree are holy, then so are the branches.

ROM11:20	All well and good—but they were broken off because of their failure to trust in God, and you stay there because you trust in God.

ROM11:24	If you could be cut from a wild olive tree, and then be grafted artificially onto a cultivated olive tree, how much more easily they could be grafted back naturally to their own tree.

ROM13:4	Those in power are God's servants, put there for your own good. If you do wrong, you should be frightened—it's not without reason that authorities have the power to punish!

TIT03:3	For there was a time when we too were foolish and disobedient. We were deceived and slaves to various desires and pleasures.
