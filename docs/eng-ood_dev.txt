On the contrary I've worked harder than all of them—though not me, but God's grace working through me. ||| Bat wa masma si s‑ni‑hoꞌigeꞌel g Jiosh.

I write to you little children, for you know the Father. I write to you fathers, for you know him who has existed from the beginning. I write to you young people, for you are strong.

<sax> Brothers and sisters, since we felt as if we'd experienced a family separation because we hadn't seen you for a while (separated physically though not in spirit), we tried even harder to come and see you again face to face because that's what we wanted to do. ||| Pi att shaꞌi pi em-chegito matt hekid am i t-gawulkai ab em-amjed.

Heki ach hu am em-ahgid mat g Jiosh s-koꞌokam wo ha namkid matp hedai am hab wo juh ihda pi apꞌekam.

Id o d woho s‑kaisdag.
<sax> Brothers and sisters, we won't keep you in the dark about the trouble we had in Asia. We were so overwhelmed that we were afraid we wouldn't have the strength to continue—so much so we doubted we would live through it. ||| Tatchua ach matt am wo i em-chegitoich ahpim t-wepnag matt heꞌekia i t-shoꞌigch am Asia jewed ch ed. Shaꞌat waꞌi si s-wechima ab t-maꞌish hegai cheggiadag. Kunt wa shaꞌi si s-mukima ni-taht.
<sax> The truth of the Son of God, Jesus Christ, was announced to you by us—me, Silvanus, and Timothy—and it wasn't both Yes and No. In Christ the answer is absolutely Yes! ||| Neh, am ach ahgachug g Silas ch Timothy wehm ab amjed g Jesus Christ. K heg d Jiosh alidag ch chum hekid hab wua mo haschu hab i ahg.
<sax> This person suffered enough punishment from the majority of you, ||| Am at wa geꞌe ab nako g e-namkidadag ab em-amjed mamt has i masma am apꞌech.
<sax> We are not like the majority who trade in the word of God for profit. Quite the opposite: we are sincere in sharing the word of God in Christ, knowing God is watching us. ||| Kut pi wo e nako mat am hab wo juh hegam mo wabsh pehegichud g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch wabsh s-uꞌimk g lial.

<sax> If the old that is fading away had glory, the new that continues has so much more glory. ||| Hekiukam chehanig at am i huhug. T wabshaba g Christ haꞌichu ahga pi hekid wo ha huhug.
<sax> Even if the good news we share is veiled, it is veiled to those who are dying. ||| Ihda s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh mach ahgachug o hegam waꞌi ha wehhejed pi tasho mo pi d e doꞌibiakam.
<sax> Since we have the same spirit of trust in God that Scripture refers to when it says, “I trusted in God, and so I spoke out,” we also trust in God and speak out for him. ||| Bo chuꞌig an Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana ed mash hema hab kaij:
<sax> As I say, we are confident, wanting to be away from the body so we can be at home with the Lord. ||| Kuch wabshaba baꞌich i chum tatchua matt an wo i t‑chihwiapad wehmaj, chum achs wo dagito ihda t‑chuhkug.
<sax> God did all this by changing us from enemies into friends through Christ. God gave us this same work of changing his enemies into his friends. ||| Jiosh at wehs id hab juh. Heki ach hu wa d obgaj. T wabshaba g Christ am gawul t‑juh mach d hahawa naipijjuj g Jiosh k ab t‑chehani matt am wo i ahgahi g haꞌichu ahgaj mat haꞌijj hab waꞌap ab wo i nawojt g Jiosh.
<sax> What compromise could the Temple of God make with idols? For we are a temple of the living God, just as God said: “I will live in them and walk among them. I will be their God, and they will be my people.” ||| Ab ach ihm g Jiosh. K pi hab chum chuꞌig machs haꞌichu ab ep wo ihmad. Jiosh o am t‑eda. K id heg wa wepo mach d cheopigaj. Neh, bo kaij g Jiosh:
<sax> See what happened to you when you had this very same experience of sorrow that God wants. Remember how enthusiastic you became, how keen you were to defend yourselves, how angry you were at what had happened, how seriously you took it, how you longed to do right, how concerned you were, how you wanted justice to be done. In all of this you showed that you were sincere in wanting to make things right. ||| S‑mahch am mat has em‑juh g Jiosh mamt pi ap e taht.

<sax> They didn't just do what we hoped they would do, but they gave themselves to the Lord, and then to us, as God wanted them to do. ||| Kut baꞌich am hab i juh mach heꞌes hab i chum ha elid nat pi wehs am i e dagito chikpanaj ed g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ mach has masma am ha tashogid.
<sax> Thanks be to God that he gave to Titus the same devotion for you that I have. ||| Titus o si pihk e elid em‑hekaj hab masma mani ahni. Kuni heg hekaj ab si i hoꞌigeꞌid g Jiosh.
<sax> That's why I decided I should ask these brothers to visit you in advance, and complete the arrangements to collect this offering, so that it would be ready as a gift, and not as something demanded. ||| Heg ani hekaj hab elid mo s‑apꞌe mant am wo si i ha cheha idam t‑wepnag mat am wehpeg wo hihim k am wo i em‑wehm apꞌech g em‑mahkig.

<sax> Look at what's staring you in the face! Anyone who considers that they belong to Christ should think again—just as they belong to Christ, so do we! ||| Haꞌi amki ab wabsh dahmjed haꞌichu neid ch hab chum si e elid mam d si Christ pionag. Am g wo si i e oidahim. Ahchim ach hab wa masma d Christ pionag mamtp has i masma hab e elid.
<sax> Was it wrong of me to humble myself so you could be elevated, since I shared the good news with you at no charge? ||| Haꞌi amsh hab ni‑elid mani pi ab hu ni‑haꞌichuchud pi shaꞌi em‑hiwgidch mams ab wo ni‑namkid. Ni eda am hab ni‑junihim mant g s‑apꞌekam am hab wo em‑juni.
<sax> (You're happy to put up with fools, since you are so wise!) ||| Kum ahpim hab e elid mam s‑chu aꞌamichud ch eda wabsh ha hiwgid hegam mo pi haꞌichu aꞌamichud
<sax> Who is weak, and I don't feel weak too? Who is led into sin, and I don't burn up? ||| Ab ani ha wehm nakog haꞌichu hegam mo pi gewpkdag. Tp hema am wo gei pi apꞌekam ch ed, ni ha wehm si ni‑kudut.
<sax> Also, because these revelations were so amazingly great, and so that I wouldn't become proud, I was given a “thorn in my flesh” a messenger from Satan to hurt me so that I wouldn't become proud. ||| Pi o hab mahs manis wo si ni‑haꞌichuchudad heg hekaj mo haschu am ni‑chehgid g Jiosh. K g t‑kownalig Jesus hiwgid g Jiawul mat wo i ni‑mumkichud k wo ni‑kudutad mant pi ab hu wo si ni‑haꞌichuchudad.
<sax> But did I take advantage of you by anyone I've sent to you? ||| ch ui g em‑lialiga hejel ni‑wehhejed. Pi o woho ihda. Am ant ha cheha hegam Titus mat am wo hihim k wo i hemapai g lial g shoꞌigkam ha wehhejed.
<sax> We can't do anything against the truth, only for the truth. ||| Pi att wo t‑nako matt wo shohbi g wohokam. Hemho wa att am wo wohokamch.
<sax> I'm telling you this because many deceivers have left and gone out into the world. They don't accept that Jesus Christ has come as a human being. Anyone like this is a deceiver and an antichrist. ||| Muꞌi at an i wuwha mo chum s-ha mashchamamk g hemajkam ch eda d wabsh s-chu iꞌattomkam ch d obgaj g Jiosh alidag no pi pi ha mashcham mat ia mahsi k d oꞌodham hab masma mach ahchim.
<sax> For this same reason, do everything you can! Add to your trust in God, goodness; add to goodness, knowledge; ||| Pegih, ab o em-mahks g wohochudadag. Kumt wo si e nakogad mamt wo s-apꞌek ch am wo si i mamche g s-apꞌekam
<sax> We didn't follow made-up myths when we told you about the coming in power of our Lord Jesus Christ—we saw his majesty for ourselves. ||| Ia atsh ep wo jiwia g t-kownalig Jesus Christ jewed dahm.

<sax> God condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to total destruction, burning them to ash, as an example of what will happen to those who live evil lives. ||| Sh gam hu baꞌich, kush shaꞌi si pi apꞌe hegam mash am d kihkam Sodom ch Gomorra t am. Tsh g Jiosh am wabsh i ha hugio idam kihhim g meikaj mat wo ha chehgi g pi ap hemajkam mat has wo ha juh.
<sax> People like these are springs without water, mists blown away by the wind. They are destined for blackest darkness—forever. ||| No hig pi woho mo pi haꞌichu wehhejed s-kehgaj g shongam matp wo gaksh o g s-chuchk chewagi matp gam hu wabsh wo wiꞌichkwua? Pegih, k hab waꞌap pi haꞌichu wehhejed s-kehgaj idam mo pi ahg g wohokam. Jiosh at am wo ha shul si s-chuhugam k ed.
<sax> But they deliberately ignore the fact that by God's command the heavens were created long ago. The earth came into existence from the water, and was surrounded by water. ||| Idam o hab s‑e junimk mo pi mahch mo id d wohokam matsh wa g Jiosh am neok k am nahto g dahm kahchim ch jewed. Ihda jewed atsh ab i wuhsh shuhdagi t amjed k g shuhdagikaj e nahto.
<sax> Remember that it is our Lord's patience that gives the opportunity for salvation. That's what our dear brother Paul was explaining to you in all his letters with the wisdom given to him by God. ||| Am g wo s‑amichudad mo g Jiosh am wabsh s‑t‑bahbgi mattp hems wehsijj wo t‑doꞌibia. Paul at wa am hab waꞌap em‑oꞌohani ihda heg hekaj amichudadag mo g Jiosh ab mahkch.

<sax> Then the lawless one will be revealed, the one whom the Lord Jesus will wipe out, blowing him away,  destroying him by the brilliance of his coming.  He (the lawless one) comes to do Satan's work, having all kinds of powers, using miracles, and performing amazing but deceptive displays.  Using every type of evil trick he deludes those who are on their way to destruction, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.  Because of this God sends them a convincing delusion so that they put their trust in the lie. ||| T am haha wo i wuhsh hegai si pi apꞌekam oꞌodham. T g jijawul ha-geꞌejig Satan ab wo mah g gewkdag.

<sax> May the Lord lead you into a deeper understanding of God's love for you and the endurance of Christ. ||| Ch ab i tahni g t-kownalig Jesus mat hab wo em-juh mamt baꞌich wo i mai g Jiosh pihk elidadag k wo s-chu nakogad hab masma mo hab masma g Jesus Christ.
<sax> Don't consider them enemies, but warn them as a brother or sister. ||| Am g wo s-chegitok mo pi d em-obga ch wabshaba d em-wepnag mamt ab wo shohbidad haꞌichukaj.
<sax> So don't be ashamed to tell others about our Lord, or be ashamed of me. Instead be ready to share in suffering for the good news as God gives you strength. ||| Pegih, pt pi has wo e elidad am wehhejed neokch g t-kownalig Jesus ch hab wa masma pi has wo e elidad ab ni-amjed mani wehhejed d lihso. Ab o t-mahkch g Jiosh g gewkdag matt am wehhejed wo t-shoꞌigch. Kupt wo si nako g e-shoꞌigdag am ahgachugch g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj.
<sax> So then, my son, grow strong in the grace of Christ Jesus. ||| Jiosh o si s-hemajim ab t-mahkch g gewkdag ahchim matt ab i t-hemakoch g Jesus Christ wehm. Kuni heg hekaj m-ahgid mapt s-gegokim wo himad g e-chikpan wehhejed.
<sax> This is a trustworthy saying: “If we died with him, we will also live with him; ||| Do si wohokam ihda hab ha-cheꞌi:
<sax> gently correcting opponents. Perhaps God may help them to come to repent and to understand the truth. ||| ch si s‑hemajim wo ha shohbidad hegam mat ab wui wo gegokiwua ch wo ha mashchamad. Tp hems ab wo ha mah g Jiosh g apꞌedag mat wo s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegitoi k ab wo s‑mai g wohokam.

<sax> Speak God's word whether it is convenient or not, tell people where they're going wrong, warn them, encourage them. Do this with a great deal of patient teaching. ||| mapt am wo si ahgahi g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga k am wo si e gewkadch mapt am wo ahgad wabsh chum hekid ch pi am hu wo chum ge nenidad mat hekid am wo s‑apkot mapt am wo ahgad.

<sax> What's happening is what was predicted by the prophet Joel: ||| Ihda mat haschu has i e juh o d hegai matsh g Joelbad an oꞌoha. Heg ash wa d Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam ch an oꞌoha hab masma:
<sax> Now he's been exalted to God's right hand, and has received from the Father the Holy Spirit whom he promised, and has poured out what you're seeing and hearing. ||| Jiosh at am i wahkid k an kei si e‑hugid an. Kut ab bei g apꞌedag k cheha g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag mat ab t‑wui wo hih. Heki ash hu hab kaij g Jiosh mat hab wo e juh. K d ihda mam am neid ch kah hemuch mat hab t‑juni.
<sax> All the believers were together and shared everything they had. ||| Sh wehsijj g Jesus ihmdam ab si e hajunit ch wehs haꞌichu ab i aꞌai e mahk mash hedai haschu i pi edgid,
<sax> Peter took him by the right hand and helped him up. Right away his feet and ankles became strong. ||| Bash kaij ch ab hahawa bei g nowij k ab i wuhshad. Kutsh am wa i hekaj ab gewpka g kakhioj.
<sax> For he must stay in heaven until the time when everything is restored, as God announced through his holy prophets long ago. ||| K hab mahs mat an wo haꞌichugk ihda Jesus dahm kahchim ch ed am hugkam mat hab wo e juh hegai mo haschu i t‑tashogid g kekelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam.
<sax> Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, answered them. “Rulers of the people, and elders: ||| Tsh ab baꞌich i gewkai g Peter g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. Sh hab kaij:
<sax> But Peter and John responded, “Whether it's right in God's eyes to obey you rather than God—you decide. ||| Sh hab hahawa si kaij hegam Peter, “Am g wo i aꞌamichud machs ahpim ab wo em‑wohoch aha natt g Jiosh.
<sax> All the believers were of one heart and mind. None of them claimed anything they had as their own, but shared everything with each other. ||| Wehsijj ash ab aꞌai si e tatchua g Jesus ihmdam ch ab si i hemakoch g e‑chegitoi k pi hedai shaꞌi s‑daꞌa g haꞌichu e‑eniga ab aꞌai e wui.
<sax> Hearing these words, Ananias fell down and died. Everyone who heard what happened was terrified. ||| T am wabsh i chum kaiok ihda g Ananias k muhk k i gei.
<sax> As a result, people brought those who were sick into the streets and laid them on beds and mats so that as Peter passed by his shadow might fall on them. ||| Kumtsh am i ha wuwhas g kokꞌodam am i neidok mo haschu has junihim g Jesus chuhchai k an kahya oidk ha wahpakusch hab elidch mat chum hems g Peter ehkadag ab hab wo e juh ha ab mat wo e dodaj.

<sax> So in the current case I recommend that you leave these men alone, and just let them go. If what they are planning or what they are doing comes from their own human thinking, then it will be defeated. ||| “Pegih, k hemuch hab wa mahs haꞌichu.

<sax> However, Barnabas took him to meet the apostles, and explained to them how Saul had seen the Lord on the road and how the Lord had spoken to Saul. Barnabas also explained how in Damascus Saul had spoken boldly in the name of Jesus. ||| Kush oi wa am wehhejed neok g Barnabas am ha wui g Jesus chuhchai.

<sax> The Jewish believers who had come with Peter were astonished, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was also poured out on the foreigners.  They heard them speaking in tongues, glorifying God. ||| Tsh am gawul neꞌokikaj neneo mat pi hebai mai k ab si ihm g Jiosh.

<sax> But I replied, ‘Absolutely not, Lord! Nothing impure or unclean has ever entered my mouth!’ ||| “Kuni hab kaij, ‘Ih, pi ant am hu hab wo ni‑juh, ni‑kownalig. Pi ani hekid koꞌa hegai mo g m‑chehanig pi t‑hiwgid.’
<sax> After they had heard this explanation, they didn't argue with him anymore, and praised God, saying, “Now God has granted the opportunity to repent and have eternal life to foreigners as well.” ||| Tsh idam am i kah wehs haꞌichu k pi ab hu has hahawa ep ahg ch wabsh si s‑hehgigam ab ihm g Jiosh ch hab kaij, “Pegih, boki d Jiosh hab elida mat idam gawul mahs hemajkam hab waꞌap gam hu wo s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegitoi k wo bei g pi ha huhugedam doakag.”
<sax> One of them called Agabus stood up and gave a prophetic warning by the Spirit that there would be a terrible famine that would affect the known world. (This came true in the reign of Emperor Claudius).  The believers decided to send funds to help the brothers that lived in Judea, with everyone giving according to what they had. ||| Sh idam hema hab chehgig Agabus.

<sax> Now Herod had become furious with the people of Tyre and Sidon. They sent a joint delegation to see him and managed to win Blastus, the king's personal assistant, over to their side. They pleaded for peace with Herod because they were dependent on the king's territory for food. ||| Tsh am hebai i cheka.

<sax> They traveled throughout the island and eventually came to Paphos. There they found a Jewish magician, a false prophet by the name of Bar-jesus.  He was close to the governor, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. Sergius Paulus invited Barnabas and Saul to come and visit him since he wanted to hear the word of God.  But the magician Elymas (his Greek name) opposed them, trying to prevent the governor from trusting in God. ||| Sh gam hu aigo hema ep kihhimag ch hab chehgig Paphos.

<sax> But when the believers gathered around him, he got up, and went back into the city. The next day he and Barnabas left for Derbe. ||| Tsh wabshaba am e chehm hegam mo ab ihm g Jesus k an wehgaj gegok g Paul. Tsh gam si i wamig k gam hu uhpam hih kihhim wui.
<sax> Paul and Barnabas had many arguments and debates with them. So Paul and Barnabas and some others were appointed to go to Jerusalem and talk to the apostles and leaders there about this issue. ||| Tsh wabshaba g Paul ch Barnabas pi shaꞌi hohhoꞌi ihda k am si ha neꞌowi idam Judea t am Tutuligo.

<sax> So we have agreed to choose some representatives and send them to you together with our much-loved brothers Barnabas and Paul,  who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. ||| Kutt heg hekaj wehsijj ia t‑hemapad k am i apꞌech matt has wo t‑juh.

<sax> Early the next day the magistrate sent officials to the jailer, telling him, “Release those men.” ||| Sh am baꞌich d i siꞌalim. Tsh g hahaꞌichu am ha ahgi g chich‑lilihi mat wo ha dagito idam Paul.
<sax> The people and the leaders of the town were very disturbed when they heard this. ||| Neh, bash kaij ch hekaj ab si i ha kudut g hemajkam ch hahaꞌichu mat wabsh wohoꞌi babgat.
<sax> So they took him to the Areopagus  and asked him, “Please tell us about this new teaching that you're promoting.  We're hearing from you things that sound odd to us, so we'd like to know what they mean.”  (All the Athenians, including foreigners who lived there, spent their whole time doing nothing except explaining or listening to something new). ||| Kush eda hegam kihkam ch hegam mo am wabsh sha dadha s‑hohhoꞌid mat tash oidam wo kaihamad ch wo aꞌagad hegai mo haschu d si wechij ahga.

<sax> For he has set a time when he will rightly judge the world by the man he has appointed, and he proved to everyone that he is the one by raising him from the dead.” ||| Am at i apꞌech g tash mat wehs wo ha lodai g hemajkam k heki hu am hema si i kei mat hab wo juh g lodaita.

<sax> Paul stayed on for a while. Then left the believers and sailed for Syria, taking Priscilla and Aquila along with him. He had his head shaved while in Cenchrae, because he had taken a vow. ||| Sh muꞌi tash am haꞌichugkahim g Paul Corinth kihhim t am ha wehm hegam mash ab s‑wohochud g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.

<sax> Some time after this Paul decided to go to Jerusalem, passing first through Macedonia and Achaia. “After I've been there, I'll have to go to Rome,” he said. ||| Tsh amjed hab i e ah g Paul matsh gam hu wo hih Macedonia ch Greece jejewed oidk k amjed gam hu haha wo hih Jerusalem wui k amjed am Rome wui wo hih.

<sax> When he had finished speaking, he dismissed the crowd. ||| Neh, bash kaij ch ha dagito.
<sax> Paul went back upstairs, broke bread, and ate together with them. He went on talking with them until dawn came, and then he left.  They took the young man home alive and well, and were very thankful for this. ||| T g hajunij gam hu hahawa i bei hegai wechij oꞌodham kihj wui si s‑ap e tahtkch mo d doakam.

<sax> I never had any desire for anyone's silver or gold or clothing. ||| Pi ani hekid hedai ha‑lialigakaj o g wehschuga shaꞌi pihk ni‑elid.
<sax> When the time was up, we left and went back to the ship to continue our journey. All the believers, and wives and children, accompanied us as we left the city. We kneeled down on the beach and prayed, and said our goodbyes. ||| T wabshaba am i e ai matt wo hihi. Tt gam hu hihi.

<sax> After this we packed our bags and headed for Jerusalem. ||| Kuch am ep haꞌichug heꞌes i tash ch am hahawa i t‑nakog k gam hu hihi Jerusalem wui.
<sax> As to the foreigners who have trusted the Lord, we already wrote a letter regarding our decision that they should refrain from eating food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from any animal that is strangled, and from sexual immorality.” ||| P am wa s‑mahch matt haschu am ha oꞌohani hegam gawul mahs hemajkam mat ab i s‑wohoch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.

<sax> When Paul got to the stairs, he had to be carried by the soldiers because the mob was so violent.  People in the crowd that was following were shouting, “Get rid of him!” ||| T an i bei mo an cheshajkudag. T wabshaba wabsh e nondagch g hemajkam k an chum s‑behimk ch si hihnk ch hab kaij, “Muꞌawo!

<sax> When the centurion heard what Paul said, he went to the commander and asked him, “What are you doing? This man is a Roman citizen.” ||| T heg am i kah ihda k am wui hih g si uhgk shondal ha‑geꞌejig k ab kakke ch hab kaij, “Nap s‑mahch maptki has wo chum chuꞌi?

<sax> When Paul realized that some of the council were Sadducees and the others Pharisees, he shouted out, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee! I'm on trial because of my hope in the resurrection of the dead!” ||| K hegam e jehnigiddam haꞌi d Sajusi ch haꞌi ep d Palasi.

<sax> “Your leaders can come with me, and make their accusation against this man, if he has done anything wrong,” he told them. ||| Kumt am haꞌi wo ni‑oid k am wo ah mam haschu ab abchud.”
<sax> When I was in Jerusalem, the Jewish chief priests and leaders came and made accusations against him and asked me to sentence him. ||| Kunt wa am hih Jerusalem wui k am ha nei g Tutuligo uꞌugchu papal ch geꞌeged. K hegam ab haꞌichu abchud ihda lihso ch ab ni‑chehani mant wo mua.
<sax> However I discovered he has not committed any crime that deserves death, and since he has appealed to the emperor I decided to send him there. ||| Nt wabshaba pi shaꞌi cheh g chuꞌijigaj mas heg hekaj wo e muhkid.
<sax> I had them punished in all the synagogues, trying to make them recant.

<sax> We'd lost a lot of time, and the voyage was becoming dangerous because it was now after the Fast. Paul warned them, ||| Kuttki pi oi baꞌich hihim k ab wabsh ai mat wo si hewedad s‑hehpichꞌed. T hekaj wo s‑ta ehbidamak matt am gahi wo i shul.

<sax> They were expecting him to swell up, or suddenly fall down dead. But after waiting a long time, they saw that nothing bad had happened to him so they changed their minds and decided he must be a god. ||| K idam kihkam am chum neid mat wo i tosko o wabsh chum hekid wo muhk k i gei.

<sax> You were “circumcised” in him but not by human hands. You have been set free from sinful human nature by the “circumcision” Christ performed.  You were buried with him in baptism, and you were raised with him through your trust in what God did by raising him from the dead. ||| Heki ach hu wa t-pahl hikuchk ahchim Tutuligo am t-chehanig oidch.

<sax> But now, in Christ Jesus, you who were once a long way off have been brought near by the blood of Christ. Christ is our peace. Through his body he made the two into one, and broke down the separating wall of hostility that divided us,  freeing us from the law with its requirements and regulations. He did this so he could create in himself one new person out of the two and so make peace,  and completely reconcile both of them to God through the cross as if they were just one body, having destroyed our hostility towards each other. ||| ch pi mahch ch pi edgid g chehanigaj.

<sax> We're not fighting against human forces, but against supernatural rulers and powers, the dark lords of this world, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavens. ||| Pi ach g hemajkam ha cheggia ch wabshaba hegam ha cheggia mo d si pi apꞌekam gewpkdag in t‑dahm ch ha‑kokownalig ch ha‑hahaꞌichuga ch g jijawul.

<sax> Let me make it clear, my friends, regarding the good news I'm declaring—it did not come from any human being. ||| Mt wo chum s-mahchk mo pi ab hu d hemajkam ha amjedkam ihda s-kehg haꞌichu ahga mani am em-ahgid.
<sax> Then I went to Syria and Cilicia. ||| Am i dahm, mant am hahawa ep hih Syria jewed wui ch Cilicia jewed wui.
<sax> We were to work for the foreigners, while they would work for the Jews. Their only instruction was to remember to look after the poor, something I was already very committed to. ||| K hegam hab t-ahg matt wo i ha wehmajk hegam mo d shoꞌigkam am ha shahgid. Am ani wa heki hu hab junihim ch hekaj si chikpan.
<sax> How could I dismiss God's grace? For if we could be made right through keeping the law then Christ died a pointless death! ||| T wabsh wo e nahnkogi g Christ muhkig matp g oꞌodham wo e nako mas wo s-apꞌek am Jiosh nena ed heg wabsh hekaj mo hab junihim g chehanigaj.

<sax> Brothers and sisters, here's an example from daily life. If a contract is drawn up and agreed, signed and sealed, nobody can ignore it or add to it. ||| Do t‑himdag matp haꞌi haꞌichu ab aꞌai wo e ahꞌad, t pi hedai wo e nako mas am hejel gawul wo juh.
<sax> But now this way of trusting Jesus has come, we no longer need such a guardian. ||| K hahawa pi d ihda chehanig ch wabshaba d Jiosh alidag mo ab i t‑chehgidch matt has wo chum masmak.
<sax> Since you are now no longer a slave, but a child, and if you are his child, then God has made you his heir. ||| nach pi hahawa pi d wabsh piongaj. T ab wo i t‑mah g Jiosh mat haschu i apꞌech am t‑wehhejed mach d aꞌaligaj.

Pegih, ni ahni hab wa masma muꞌi haꞌichu nakog am em‑wehhejed mant ab wo em‑ahijidaj mamt hab wo masmak mo g Jiosh alidag.
<sax> Christ set us free so we could have real freedom. So stand firm and don't get burdened down again by a yoke of slavery. ||| T‑doꞌibia at g Christ. S‑wihnam g an wo uꞌukchid g e doꞌibiadag ch pi ab hu ep wo chum i hiw g chehanig mams hekaj wo e doꞌibia.
<sax> As for me, brothers and sisters, if I were still advocating circumcision—why am I still persecuted? If that was true, it would remove the issue of the cross that offends people so much. ||| Haꞌi o hab kaij mani ahni ahgachug mamt am hab wo junihid g t‑chehanig ch hekaj wo s‑apꞌek am Jiosh nena ed.

<sax> Those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed to the cross their sinful human nature, together with all their sinful passions and desires. ||| Ahchim mach d Christ hemajkamga att hab i t‑ah matt pi am hu hab wo junihid g hejel t‑tatchui.
<sax> Let's never tire of doing good, for we'll reap a harvest at the proper time, if we don't give up. ||| Pi g shaꞌi haꞌasa hab wo junihid g s‑apꞌekam. Jiosh o am wa apꞌechudch g tash mat ab wo i em‑mah g em‑gehgewadag.
<sax> has in these last days spoken to us through his Son. God appointed the Son heir of everything, and made the universe through him. ||| Kutsh g Jiosh am hahawa i kei g e-alidag. Tsh id ia i wuhsh jewed dahm k si s-ap t-tashogid g Jiosh. Id o wud matsh g Jiosh ged hu i si wehpeg am i kei matsh wehs haꞌichu wo nahto. K heg hekaj wehs haꞌichu d enigaj.
<sax> But as it's been said, “What are human beings that you should worry about them? What is a son of man  that you should care about him?  You set him a little lower than the angels; you crowned him with glory and honor, and placed him over all your creation. ||| Neh, an o hebai hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed mash hema hab kaij ab Jiosh wui:
<sax> He was faithful to God in the work he was chosen to do, just like Moses was faithful to God in God's house. ||| Jiosh atsh heki hu am i kei g Mosesbad ha dahm g e‑hemajkamga. Kush heg s‑ap am hab junihim g e‑chikpan. Pegih, sh g Jesus hab waꞌap s‑ap am hab junihim g e‑chikpan am Jiosh wehhejed.
<sax> Who was God upset with for forty years? Wasn't it those who sinned, those who were buried in the desert?  Who was God speaking of when he vowed they should not enter into his rest? Wasn't it those who disobeyed him? ||| Sh g Jiosh s‑ha kehꞌid ch hab kaij matsh pi wo ha hiwigi mas am wo i wahp amai mash hebai am chum apꞌechudch ha wehhejed k hoꞌip wehs koi hegam geꞌeged mash pi ab hu wohog elid. Kush heg hekaj am oiopo tohono jewed ch ed giꞌikko wehst‑mahm (40) aꞌahid ab.
<sax> So we should go confidently to God on his throne of grace so we can receive mercy, and discover grace to help us when we really need it. ||| Pegih, ab o t‑kaiham g Jiosh no pi g alidaj d uhgchu t‑pahlig ch si pihk e elid t‑hekaj. Kutt heg hekaj s‑ap wo t‑nako matt ab wo tahnid g i wehmtadag ch pi wo ehbidad. T heg ab wo i s‑t‑hoꞌigeꞌid k ab wo i t‑wehmt.
<sax> Those who drink baby milk don't have the experience of living the right way—they're just babies. ||| nam pi pi amichud g Jiosh neꞌoki ab amjed g s‑apꞌekam.
<sax> God wouldn't be so unjust as to forget what you've done and the love you've shown for him by the care you've shown for fellow-believers—something you're still doing. ||| S‑ap am haꞌichu hab junihim ha wehhejed g e‑wehm wohochuddam ch hab wabsh kia junihim nam pi si pihk e elid ha hekaj. T g Jiosh wo s‑chegito hegai mam haschu hab junihim.
<sax> Abraham gave him a tithe of all that he had won. Melchizedek's name means “king of right” while king of Salem means “king of peace.” ||| Tsh g Abrahambad ab mah mo haschu ab d wuikamaj g Jiosh mash d hemako tahpna mo wehst‑mahm e tahpanch g gehgewadaj.
<sax> If the priesthood is changed, then the law needs to be changed too. ||| Kut hemho wa am gawul juh g Jiosh g e‑chehanig mat am wo i kei g Jesus mat d wo t‑pahligk.
<sax> As a result he is able to save completely those who come to God through him, living always to plead their case on their behalf. ||| Kut wo e nako mat wehs wo ha doꞌibia hegam mat am gahi wuhshanim ab wo i e nohnogi Jiosh wui nat pi chum hekid d wo doakamk ch am ha wehhejed ab wo tahnid g Jiosh mat am wo i ha wehmt.
<sax> If that first agreement had been perfect, then a second wouldn't have been necessary. ||| Pi at am hu hab wo juh g wechij apchuda g Jiosh matp g hekiukam s‑ap am wo i t‑apꞌech wehhejed.
<sax> This is an illustration for us in the present, showing us that the gifts and sacrifices that are offered can't make the worshiper's conscience clear. ||| K d wabsh chehgida mo g haꞌichu doakam ab iagchulid Jiosh wui. Pi at woho am wo i ha apꞌech Jiosh tahgio. K heg hekaj am wabsh kia e kudut heg hekaj pi ap e‑chuꞌijig.
<sax> After Moses had given all the commandments of the law to everyone, he took the blood of calves and goats, and together with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, sprinkled the book itself and all the people. ||| Mosesbad atsh wehpeg am wehs ha ahgi g chehanig mo has i masma an oꞌohanas k am hahawa wasib g wisilo ch siswat ha‑ehꞌed k g shuhdagi am i wehnad k id oꞌos heg ab oꞌohana mo an hab chuꞌig g chehanig ch ab ha dahm g hemajkam. Batsh juh ihda am wa has mahs shaꞌikaj mo hab e aꞌaga ‘hyssop’ ch kahwal wopo mo i wegiumdas.
<sax> But in fact those sacrifices remind people of sins year after year, ||| Ihda t‑iagchulida o am wabsh i t‑chechegitolid g t‑chuꞌijig wehs ahid ab.
<sax> Since we have such a great priest placed in charge over the house of God, ||| no pi s‑wohom d si uhgchu t‑pahlig ahchim Jiosh hemajkamga.
<sax> Just remember the past when, after you understood the truth, you experienced a great deal of suffering. ||| Am g wo s‑chegito mo wa has chuꞌig haꞌichu am em‑wehhejed. Muꞌi haꞌichu amt nako amjed mamt ab s‑mai g wohokam k eda pi shaꞌi e gehgch heg hekaj.
<sax> By trusting God Enoch was taken to heaven so he didn't experience death. He couldn't be found on earth because God took him to heaven. Before this happened he was known as someone God was pleased with. ||| Hema ash wa hab chehgig Enoc ch ash ab s‑wohochud g Jiosh. Sh g Jiosh s‑hohhoꞌid ch gam hu i bei mash wabsh kia doa. Kutsh pi hedai edagi.

<sax> Instead he chose to share in the sufferings of God's people rather than to enjoy the temporary pleasures of sin. ||| Baꞌich i mat ab wo nako g shoꞌigdag ha wehm g Jiosh hemajkamga ki hegai mat am heꞌes wo si s‑hehgigk ha wehm hegam mo pi ab hu wohochud g Jiosh.
<sax> Women were given their dead family members back through resurrection. Others were tortured, refusing to compromise and be pardoned, because they wanted to be part of a better resurrection. ||| Jiosh atsh wa ab uhpam i ha chegitoich g ha‑koꞌidag haꞌi uꞌuwi mo ab s‑wohochud.
<sax> Have you forgotten God's appeal to you when he reasons with you as his children? He says, “My child, don't treat the Lord's discipline lightly, and don't give up when he corrects you either.  The Lord disciplines everyone he loves, and he punishes everyone he welcomes as his child.” ||| Pi g am wo pi chegito mo ab si i em‑gewkemhun g Jiosh ch hab masma ab em‑wehm neok mam d aꞌaligaj mash wa hab kaij:
<sax> Make sure there's nobody who is sexually immoral, or irreligious, like Esau was. He sold his birthright for a single meal. ||| Am g wo s‑e nenꞌoidad mamt pi wo e uamhu g pi apꞌekamkaj wabsh pehegchudch g Jiosh haꞌichu hab masma matsh wa hab e juh hegai mash hab chehgig Esau.

<sax> Since we're receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us have a gracious attitude, so we can serve God in a way that pleases him, with reverence and respect. ||| Pegih, tt ab wo si i hoꞌigeꞌel g Jiosh mat ab i t‑ui id eda kownaltalig mat pi haꞌichu wo e nako mat wo uꞌugij.

<sax> Now may the God of peace who raised our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, from the dead, with the blood of an eternal agreement— ||| Ahni ani hab waꞌap ab haꞌichu tahni g Jiosh mat hab wo em‑juni.

<sax> Nobody like that should think they'll get anything from the Lord— ||| Idam at g Jiosh pi am hu hab wo ha juni mat haschu ab wo i tai
<sax> He chose to give us new life through the word of truth, so that out of all his creation we would be very special to him. ||| Jiosh at am i t-tashogi g wohokam. Kutt ab i s-wohoch. T hekaj ab i t-gawulkad k ab i t-mah g wechij doakag matt d wo aꞌaligajk.

<sax> and you say to them, “Blessings on you! Stay warm and have a good meal!” and you don't provide what they need to survive, what's the good of that? ||| Pi o apꞌe machs pi am hu wo i ha wehmt k hab wabsh wo chei, “Jiosh at wo waꞌi i em‑wehmt.”
<sax> My friends, not many of you should become teachers, because you know that we who teach will have a heavier responsibility in the judgment. ||| Pi g am wabsh wo s‑e hohtkidad mamt d wo ha mashchamdamk ch wo ha ahgidad g ha‑chuꞌijig. Jiosh at baꞌich i s‑gewkam wo hudaw mach haschu has i junihim ahchim mach d ha mashchamdam natt pi chum baꞌich wo i s‑mahchk mo haschu d s‑apꞌekam.
<sax> Does a spring send both sweet and bitter water out of the same opening? ||| Neh, no hig ab e wehm i daꞌiwuni g s‑kehg shuhdagi ch s‑onk shuhdagi shon k amjed?
<sax> You pray, but don't receive anything, because you ask with a wrong motive, wanting to spend what you'd receive on your selfish pleasures. ||| T wabshaba g Jiosh pi ab hu wo em‑mah mam haschu i tahni matp g em‑tatchui pi wo apꞌek.

<sax> He came to his own people, but they didn't accept him. ||| Ia adki mahsi k d t-wehm oꞌodham. D eda muꞌijj g Tutuligo pi amichud ch pi ab hu hiwig.
<sax> “I am ‘a voice calling in the desert, “Make the Lord's way straight!” ’ ” he said, using the words of the prophet Isaiah ||| D g John hab hahawa kaij, “Ahni ani wud mo hab ni‑ahg ch an oꞌohanas:

<sax> “Mother, why should you involve me? My time hasn't come yet,” he replied. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus, “Pi o ab hu haꞌichu ni-him heg amjed. Pi at koi chum e ai mant am wo i ni-maskogi.”
<sax> In the Temple he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves; and money-changers sitting at their tables. ||| k ged hu dada geꞌe cheopi t am. D eda am haꞌi ha gagda g haiwani ch kahwal ch hohohi ch am haꞌi kammialt g lial heg wehhejed.
<sax> He didn't need anyone to tell him about human nature for he knew the way people think. ||| Pi o hedai ab hu hiwig g Jesus mas am wo ahgi g hemajkam ha‑chegitoi no pi heki hu s‑mahch.
<sax> “I tell you the truth, we speak of what we know and give evidence regarding what we have seen, but you refuse to accept our testimony. ||| Do si wohokam ihda mani m‑ahgid. M ach ahgachug mach haschu s‑ap s‑mahch ch am em‑ahgid mach haschu neid. M eda pi wohochud g haꞌichu t‑ahga.

<sax> Yet anyone who accepts what he says confirms that God is truthful.  For the one God sent speaks God's words, because God doesn't restrict the Spirit. ||| Jiosh at am cheha g e‑alidag mat ia wo jiwia jewed dahm k s‑baꞌama ab mah g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag.

<sax> Meanwhile Jesus' disciples were urging him, “Rabbi, please eat something!” ||| D koi e chehm g hemajkam, kuchd ab chum si ahgid g Jesus mat wo haꞌichu huh.
<sax> and because of what he told them many more trusted in him. ||| D muꞌijj ab ep i s‑wohoch ab i kaiok g ahgaj
<sax> He asked them what time it was when his son began to get better. “Yesterday at one p.m. the fever left him,” they told him. ||| Sh am hahawa ha kakke, “Heꞌekia ohla k ed at ab i apꞌetahi.”
<sax> “Stand up, pick up your mat, and start walking!” Jesus told him. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus, “I wuhshani k am behꞌi g e‑wahkus k hihm!”
<sax> This was why the Jews tried even harder to kill him, for not only did he break the Sabbath but also called God his Father, making himself equal with God. ||| D am hahawa i si e gewpkai mat wo mua nad pi am i kah mo hab masma ihm g Jiosh ch heg hekaj e wepogid g Jiosh.
<sax> Don't be surprised at this, for the time is coming when all those in the grave will hear his voice ||| “Pi g am wo e totodsid id hekaj mani has i kaij. Ab o him g tash mat wehs g koꞌi s‑ap wo ni‑kah k ab wo i wuwha.

<sax> After this, Jesus left to go to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (also known as the Sea of Tiberias). ||| Am hu hebai ep amjed machd an oiopohim Galilee Kahchki hugid an ch gam hu hahawa i chehchsh haꞌabjed k am dada.
<sax> Jesus took the bread, gave thanks, and had it handed out to the people as they sat there.

<sax> For even his own brothers really didn't believe in him. ||| Neh, bad kaij noki pi koi wohochud mo d Jiosh si Kehsha.

<sax> A slave doesn't have a permanent place in the family, but the son is part of the family forever. ||| Pi o am hu ha wehm d si kihkam g nehol mo hig g ha‑aliga.
<sax> So because I tell you the truth, you don't believe me! ||| Kuni ahni g wohokam ahg. Kum heg hekaj pi ni‑wohochud.

<sax> Some of the Pharisees said, “The man who did this can't be from God because he doesn't keep the Sabbath.” But others wondered, “How could a sinner do such miracles?” So they were divided in their opinion. ||| D haꞌi hab kaij hegam Palasi, “Neh, pi o ab hu shaꞌi Jiosh amjed nat pi melchkwua g t‑chehanig hab juhk ihda t‑mihshmda tash ed.”

<sax> If I hadn't come and spoken to them, they wouldn't be guilty of sin—but now they have no excuse for their sin.  Anyone who hates me hates my Father as well.  If I had not given them such a demonstration through things that no one had ever done before, they wouldn't be guilty of sin, but despite seeing all this they hated both me and my Father. ||| Ia ant jiwia ha wui k am ha ahgi ab amjed g ni‑ohg k am ha chehgi g s‑hasig chikpan mat pi hedai hekid hab juh.

<sax> “But who do you say I am?” he asked them. ||| Sh ab ep ha kakke g Jesus, “Kum ahpim hig hedai ni‑elid?”

<sax> “It's true that Elijah comes first to prepare everything,” Jesus replied. “But why then does it say in Scripture that the Son of man has to suffer so much and be treated with contempt?  However, I tell you that Elijah has come, and they abused him in whatever way they wanted, just as Scripture said they would.” ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “Hema at woho wehpeg wo e maskogid k hab wo masmak mash wa g Elijabad ch wehs haꞌichu wo i apꞌech.

<sax> If your hand leads you to sin, cut it off! It's better to enter eternal life as a cripple than to go with both hands into Gehenna , into the fire that can't be put out.     If your foot causes you to sin, cut it off! It's better to enter eternal life lame than to be thrown into Gehenna still having two feet.    If your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out! It's better to enter the kingdom of God with just one eye than to be thrown into Gehenna still having both eyes,  where the worm doesn't die and the fire never goes out. ||| “Pi at hedai wo e nako mas ab uhpam wo i wuhsh Jiawul kih amjed.

<sax> They continued on their way to Jerusalem, with Jesus walking on ahead. The disciples were apprehensive and the other followers were afraid. So Jesus took the disciples aside and began to explain to them what was about to happen to him. ||| Kutsh gam hu i oi g wohg Jerusalem wui. Sh gam hu ha baꞌich him g Jesus.

<sax> Now what is the owner of the vineyard going to do?

<sax> One man ran and filled a sponge with vinegar, put it on a stick, and tried to give it to Jesus to drink. “Leave him alone,” he said. “Let's see if Elijah will come to take him down.” ||| Kud am hema med k an haꞌichu usko mad am wakch nawait ch ed k am uhgk i be k ab chum iꞌich g Jesus k hab chei, “Kia koi, tt hig wo nei mas ia wo jiwia g Elijabad k ab wo i huduni.”

<sax> He's not a servant anymore, because he's more than a servant. He's a specially-loved brother, particularly to me, and even more to you, both as a man and as a fellow-believer in the Lord. ||| Do si t-wehnag, wahm ahpi, no pi d m-pionag ch am i dahm d hahawa m-wehm wohochuddam.

<sax> I'm used to having nothing, and I've experienced having plenty too. In every possible situation I've learned the secret of dealing with having plenty and going hungry, of being rich and of living in poverty: ||| chum anis hebaichujj wo bihugim k pi haꞌichu wo edgidad o hebaichujj geꞌe haꞌichu wo edgidad.

<sax> Don't be afraid about what you are going to suffer. Yes, the devil will throw some of you into prison to test you, and you will suffer persecution for ten days. Just remain faithful, even if it means death, and I will give you the crown of life! ||| “Pi g am wo shaꞌi ehbidad mamtp haschu i s-koꞌok ab wo nako. Neh, mt wo em-kuh.

<sax> After this I saw a door that had been opened in heaven. The voice that I'd heard before, the one that sounded like a trumpet, told me, “Come up here, and I will show you what will happen next.” ||| Ab ant hahawa i nen k haꞌichu ep neid.

Worship God, for Jesus' testimony is the prophetic spirit.” ||| Kunt am hahawa si i gei wecho k ab si has i el. K wabshaba hab kaij ab ni-wui, “Pi g hab masma ab si has ni-elid mani d Jiosh.

<sax> The beast was captured, along with the false prophet who performed miracles in his presence (by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped the beast's image). Both of them were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur. ||| Kumt bei hegai s-ta Ehbidamakam ch heg ehp s-chu Iattomkam Haꞌichu i Tashogiddam.

<sax> The devil, who had deceived them, was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet had also been thrown, and they will suffer in anguish day and night for ever and ever. ||| Mt amjed g ge Jiawul am daꞌich heg eda kahchki mo chum hekid meihim.

<sax> Then he said to me, “Everything's done! I am the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end. To anyone who is thirsty I will give the free gift of water from the spring of the water of life. ||| K hab ep kaij, “E at nahto wehs haꞌichu. Ahni ani d alpha ch d omega.

<sax> The city was square. The length was the same as the width. He measured the city with the rod, it was 12,000 furlongs.  The length, width, and height were all the same. ||| K ihda kihhim si s-ap s-chuhchpul ch haꞌas uhgk ch haꞌas chewaj mo heꞌes i s-tadani. T g anghil am kuint. K d mihl hetasp siant (1500) mihya.
<sax> The nations' honor and glory will be brought into the city. ||| Si s-has hahaꞌichu am wehs jejewed ch ed at am wo uꞌapa g e-kakaisdag.
<sax> He told me, “Don't do that! I am one of God's servants just as you are, together with your brothers the prophets, and those who obey the words of this book. Worship God!” ||| K wabshaba hab kaij ab ni-wui, “Pi g am hab e juhni. Dani wabsh em-wehm pion ahpim Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam ch wehs hegam mo ab s-wohog elid mo haschu an oꞌohadag id eda oꞌohana. Ab g has i elid g Jiosh.”
<sax> If anyone takes away the prophetic words of this book, God will take away their share of the tree of life and of the holy city that are described in this book. ||| K in oꞌohadag mach apꞌedag matt am wo i wahp Si Hekia S-apꞌekam Kihhim ed k wo huh g bahidag hegai uhs mo ab t-chehgidch g pi ha huhugedam doakag. T wabshaba g Jiosh gm hu hab wo i juh g em-apꞌedag mamtp ahpim haꞌichu gam hu hab wo i juh id amjed oꞌohana.
<sax> I really want to visit you and share with you a spiritual blessing to strengthen you. ||| S-em-neidamk ani ch ab tahni g Jiosh matp hems am wo apꞌech mant am wo i em-chehgim k wo i em-wehmt em-wohochudadag ed mamt hekaj am wo i e gewpkai.
<sax> Even though they claimed to be wise, they became foolish. ||| Bo e ahg mo s‑chu aꞌamichud ch eda pi haꞌichu mahch.
<sax> When you judge them do you really think that you however can avoid God's judgment? ||| Kumt ahpim hemho wa hab waꞌap wo bei g s‑koꞌok e‑namkidadag mamtp am hab wo junihid ihda.
<sax> Just listening to what the law says doesn't make you right in God's sight. It's those who <span class="it">do</span> what the law says who are made right. ||| Pi at hedai wo i ha apꞌech g Jiosh heg wabsh hekaj mo kah g chehanig k washaba heg hekaj mat heg am hab wo junihid.
<sax> The uncircumcised foreigners who keep the law will condemn you if you break the law, even though you have the written law and circumcision. ||| Gawul mahs hemajkam o pi pahl hikuchkas ch eda haꞌi hab e junihim mo hab masma hab chuꞌig g chehanig. Kut heg hekaj ab wo e chuꞌijigch g Tutuligo no pi edgid g chehanig ch eda melichkwuhim.
<sax> Is it a case of, “Let's sin to bring about good”? That's what some people have slanderously accused us of saying. They should be rightly condemned! ||| Haꞌijj o an ha iattogid manish hab kaij matt am hab wo junihid g pi apꞌekam ch hab masma wo tashogi g s‑apꞌekam. T wabshaba g Jiosh wo s‑koꞌokam ha namkid heg hekaj.
<sax> but now at this present time God proves he is fair and does what is right, and that he makes right those who trust in Jesus. ||| nat pi g alidaj wo e muhkid am wehs t‑wehhejed. Bo wa masma am t‑chehgidch g Jiosh mo chum hekid hab wua g s‑apꞌekam ch wo e nako mat am wo i ha apꞌech g pi ap chuꞌijkam mat hekid ab wo bei g Jesus nat pi heg ab moht g s‑koꞌok t‑namkidadag.
<sax> It was actually before he became a Jew by being circumcised, which was a confirmation of his trust in God to make him right. This happened before he was circumcised, so he is the father of everyone who trusts in God and are considered as right by God, even though they may not be circumcised Jews.  He is also the father of circumcised Jews not merely because they're circumcised, but because they follow the example of the trust in God our father Abraham had before he was circumcised. ||| Ab ash wa s‑wohochud g Jiosh. Sh g Jiosh heg hekaj hab kaij mo d s‑apꞌekam. T heg i dahm am hahawa e pahl hikuch mat hab masma am wo wohokamch g e‑wohochudadag mat heg hekaj am i apꞌech g Jiosh.

<sax> Since we have this hope we're never disappointed, for God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit he's given us. ||| Ab at i t‑mah g Jiosh g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. K heg ab t‑mahtchulid mo si pihk e elid g Jiosh ab t‑wui. Ch hekaj s‑mahch mat woho am wo i t‑wahpki g Jiosh e‑kihdag ed.
<sax> As a result of one man's sin, death ruled because of him. But God's grace is so much greater and his gift sets us right, for everyone who receives it will rule in life through the person of Jesus Christ! ||| Muhkig at ab wehsijj t‑maꞌish heg hekaj. Adambad pi ap chuꞌijig. K wabshaba g Jiosh si s‑hemajim ab t‑makiog g hoꞌigeꞌidadag. Kutt am aigo dahm i chehchsh g muhkig ahchim matt ab bei. Ab o t‑mahkch g apꞌedag am gahi wuhshanim g Christ matt s‑ap wo himad g t‑doakag id dahm jewed.
<sax> We know that our old self was crucified with him to dispose of the dead body of sin so that we wouldn't be enslaved by sin any longer. ||| Am att i dagito g heki hu t‑doakag. Kut hab gam hu hab i e juh g pi ap t‑tatchui. K pi an hu hahawa t‑wulshch g pi apꞌekam.
<sax> Don't you realize that if you make yourselves someone's slaves, obeying their orders, then you are slaves to the one you obey? If you are slaves of sin, the result is death; if you obey God, the result is you are made right with him. ||| T wabshaba g pi apꞌekam an wo ha uꞌukchid matp hab wo junihid. T g Jiosh s‑koꞌokam ab wo ha namkid. Ab amt wo s‑wohog elidad g Jiosh. T heg am wo i em‑apꞌech e wehhejed.
<sax> In the same way, my friends, you've become dead to the law through the body of Christ, and so now you belong to someone else—Christ, who was raised from the dead so that we could live a productive life for God. ||| Pegih, k hab waꞌap chuꞌig am t‑wehhejed ahchim matt ab i s‑wohoch g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh. Am att i t‑hemakoj g Christ wehm. K id heg wepogidas matt am wehmaj muh. K pi an hu hahawa t‑uꞌukch g chehanig. Dach enigaj hegai mat e chegito ab muhkig amjed ch hekaj s‑ap haꞌichu hab wo chum junihid am wehhejed g Jiosh.
<sax> I really don't understand what I'm doing. I do the things I don't want to do, and what I hate doing, that's what I do! ||| Pi o wa ta amichudama g ni‑doakag am ni‑wehhejed mani wa eda wabsh hejel ab ni‑hiwig. S‑mahch ani mo haschu d s‑apꞌekam ch wabshaba pi am hu hab junihim ch heg hab waꞌi junihim mani haschu i pi hohhoꞌid.
<sax> So there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. ||| Pi o ab hu hahawa t‑abchud g Jiosh g haꞌichu t‑chuꞌijig ahchim mach ab si hiwig g Jesus Christ.
<sax> The Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead lives in you. He who raised Jesus from the dead will also give life to your dead bodies through his Spirit that lives in you. ||| Kut am uhpam ep wo t‑chegitoich g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag hab masma mat hab juh g Christ.
<sax> We know that all creation groans with longing, suffering birth-pains even up till now. ||| S‑mahch ach mo hemuch g haꞌichu nahtoij g Jiosh shahag wepo mo shahshani hab sha masma mat g uwi g ali wo be k ab i taht g s‑koꞌok.
<sax> God, who did not hold back his own Son, but gave him up for all of us, won't he also freely give us everything? ||| Pi at shaꞌi t‑daꞌi g Jiosh g e‑alidag. Kuch heg hekaj s‑mahch mat pi haꞌichu ep wo shaꞌi t‑daꞌi. Alidaj at ab wui e iagchul am t‑wehhejed.
<sax> In addition Rebecca's twin sons had the same father, our forefather Isaac. ||| Neh, tsh am hema hohnt g Isaacbad am i geꞌedak. Sh id hab chehgig Rebecca ch gohk ha mahmadt.
<sax> This is who we are—people he has called, not just from among the Jews, but from among the foreigners too... ||| Ahpim gawul mahs hemajkam am d ep waidaj. Jiosh at ab ep i em‑gawulkai.
<sax> Moses wrote, “Whoever does what is right by obeying the law will live.” ||| An atki hi wa oꞌoha g Mosesbad mash hab kaij g Jiosh:
<sax> So am I saying that they stumbled and consequently failed completely? Not at all! But as a result of their mistakes, salvation came to other nations, to “make them jealous.” ||| Neh, bo chuꞌig. Jiosh at am ha dagito hegam ni‑wehm oꞌodham mo pi ab hu kaiham. T heg hekaj am i e ahgahi g doꞌibiadag ahga gawul mahs hemajkam ha wui. Kutp hems haꞌi g ni‑wehm oꞌodham wo s‑ha hehgam k ab haha wo kaihamad g Jiosh. Kut pi wabsh wo s‑kehg ha hugio g Jiosh.
<sax> because if God didn't spare the original branches, he won't spare you either. ||| Gm at hu hab i ha juh g Jiosh hegam Tutuligo mo pi ab hu wohochud. Kumt ahpim gam hu hab ep wo i e juh mamtp pi ab hu wo wohochudad.
<sax> For God treated everyone as prisoners because of their disobedience so that he could be merciful to everyone. ||| Wehs hemajkam o d pi ap chuꞌijkam am Jiosh nena ed. Kut g Jiosh wehs ha wepo wo s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌel hegam mat ab wui wo i e nohnogi.
<sax> if encouragement then you should encourage; if giving then you should give generously; if leadership then you should lead with commitment; if being merciful then you should do so gladly. ||| o haꞌichukaj ab wo i ha gewkemhunad. Haꞌi o d em‑mahkigdag mamt ab wo haꞌichu ha hoꞌidad g e‑wehm wohochuddam. Am g s‑baꞌama hab wo wuad ch s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌid. Haꞌi o d em‑mahkigdag mamt d wo ha wanimeddamk.

<sax> and as far as it's up to you, live at peace with everyone. ||| Am g wo i e nakog mamt s‑ap e tahtk ch ab wo ha neidad g hemajkam mamtp heꞌes wo i e nako.
<sax> “You must not commit adultery, you must not kill, you must not steal, you must not jealously want things for yourself” —these and the other commandments are summed up in the statement, “Love your neighbor as yourself.” ||| Bo chuꞌig g chehanigaj:
<sax> Those who respect a special day do so for the Lord; and those who eat without worrying do so for the Lord since they give thanks to God; while those who avoid eating certain things do so for the Lord, and they also give thanks to God. ||| Matp hedai ab wo si has elidad hema tash ch hab e wua mat heg eda ab wo si i ihm g Jiosh.

<sax> for God's kingdom is not about eating and drinking, but about living right, having peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. ||| Pi o d si haꞌichu machs haschukaj wo t‑gegosidad.

<sax> May the God who gives patience and encouragement help you to be in full agreement among yourselves as you follow Christ Jesus,  so that you can with one mind and with one voice together glorify God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! ||| Do Jiosh mo ab i t‑gewkemhun matt s‑ap t‑tahtkk ch wo nenida g t‑apꞌedag.

<sax> through the power of signs and miracles done with the Holy Spirit's power. From Jerusalem all the way over to Illyricum, everywhere I've shared fully the good news of Christ. ||| Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag o ab ni‑mahkch hegai gewkdag mani hekaj hab wua g s‑hasig haꞌichu.
