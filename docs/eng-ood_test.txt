<sax> May you have grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. ||| Ab o wa si s-em-hoꞌigeꞌid g t-ohg Jiosh g t-kownalig Jesus Christ wehm ch ab wo wa baꞌich i em-mahkad g i wehmtadag ch s-ap tahhadkam.
<sax> I'm grateful to God that I didn't baptize any of you, except Crispus and Gaius,  so nobody can claim they were baptized in my name.  (Oh, and I also baptized the Stephanas family—I can't think of anyone else.)  For Christ didn't send me out to baptize, but to spread the good news, and not with eloquent human wisdom, otherwise the cross of Christ would be made powerless. ||| Pi ant heg wehhejed am hu jiwia manis wehs wo em-pahl wapko.

<sax> He chose the things that are unimportant and despised by the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing the things that are, ||| Pi am ab hu em‑haꞌichuchud ch wabsh s‑em‑uhwaid. T wabshaba g Jiosh ab i em‑gawulkai mat hekaj am wo ha chehgi mo pi d shaꞌi haꞌichu hegam mo g hemajkam ab si has ha elid.
<sax> On the contrary we explain God's wisdom in terms of a revealed mystery that was previously hidden which God planned for our glory before the creation of the worlds. ||| Ihda haꞌichu amichudadag mani hab ahg o d Jiosh hab elida am t‑wehhejed ch an hab chuꞌig mat koi in hu nahto ihda jewed ch wabsh s‑aꞌagi an hab ah chuꞌig. Do Jiosh hab elida mat g Christ wo t‑doꞌibia.
<sax> My brothers and sisters, I couldn't talk with you as spiritual believers, but as worldly people—like baby Christians. ||| Am ani wa pi hasigam neok, ni‑wepnag, mani am em‑ahgid g wohokam namt pi pi koi geꞌegeꞌehogat id eda t‑wohochudadag ch pi am hu si e dagitokch Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag wui.

<sax> For no one can lay any other foundation than what's already laid—that is Jesus Christ. ||| Shondaj o heki hu nahtois ch d Jesus Christ. Kumt pi haschukaj ab ep wo shondad.
<sax> So don't boast about people. For you have everything,  whether it's Paul or Apollos or Peter—or the world, or life, or death, or the present, or the future. You have everything— ||| Kumt hekaj pi hedai wo chum ge t‑haꞌichuchudad. Dach wabsh em‑pionag g Apollos ch Peter ha wehm. Wehs ihda jewed o d em‑eniga. Hegai mo hemu in haꞌichug ch hegai mo ab hahawa him o d em‑eniga. Doakag ch muhkig d em‑apꞌedag.
<sax> The way I see it, God has put us apostles on display as the last in the line, condemned to die. We have been made a public show before the entire universe, to angels and to human beings. ||| Kuch eda wehs ha baꞌich d i shoꞌigkam ch attp hems wo t‑koꞌij am wehhejed g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. Shahag wepo mo g Jiosh am t‑chehgidch wehs ha baꞌich hab masma mat g kownal am wo ha chehgi hegam matp ha gewito k ha lilsoch.
<sax> But I am coming to visit you soon, if that's what the Lord wants. Then I'll find out what these arrogant people are saying, and what kind of power they have. ||| Nt wabshaba s‑hohtam ab wo i hih em‑wui matp g Jiosh hab d wo elidak k am haha wo s‑mai mams has masma himchud g e‑doakag ahpim mam chum si e sheshmachud ch muꞌi neneok.
<sax> So let us celebrate this festival  not with old yeast or the yeast of evil and wickedness, but with the bread made without yeast, the bread of sincerity and truth. ||| Pegih, tt wo si s‑hehgigk id hekaj ch gam hu hab wo i juh g pi apꞌekam k hab wo waꞌi junihid g s‑apꞌekam ch hab wo waꞌi kaijjid g wohokam.
<sax> The very fact you have lawsuits against each other already is a complete disaster. Wouldn't it be better to accept the injustice? Why not let yourselves be defrauded? ||| Am am e chehgidch mamt i e gehgch mam eda e kamꞌon. Matp pi am hu wo i em‑apꞌech g em‑wehm wohochuddam, mt wabsh pi am hu has wo kaijjid ch wo nako, chum ams haꞌichu em‑ehs.
<sax> But whoever is joined to the Lord is one with him in spirit! ||| K pi hab chum mahs machs hab wo masmak chehpaꞌawi wehm ahchim matt ab i t‑dagito Christ wui nach pi d hemako heg wehm.
<sax> To those who are not yet married, or who are widowed, I would say it is better if they remain like me. ||| Nt wo haꞌichu em‑ahgi ahpim mam pi ha wehm kihkam ch ahpim mat koi g em‑wehm kihkam. Baꞌich o i s‑apꞌe mamt wo heheꞌejelk mani hab masma.
<sax> If you were a slave when you were called, don't worry—though if you have an opportunity to become free, take it. ||| Mamtp hedai d wo ha‑neneholigak id dahm jewed ch wabsh pi heg hekaj wo si e ehꞌel ab s‑wohochudk g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.

<sax> Now about “food sacrificed to idols.” So “we all have knowledge” about this subject. Knowledge makes us proud, but love strengthens us. ||| Am ant haha wo em‑ahgi hegai mam ab ni‑kakke ab amjed hegai haꞌichu hugi mo g hemajkam an toꞌaw am chum iagchulidch g e‑jijoshga.
<sax> By your “better knowledge” the weaker believer is destroyed, a believer for whom Christ died. ||| natt pi heg hekaj wo heki ha himch hegam mo pi gewpkdag e‑wohochudadag ed. Tsh eda g Christ ha wehhejed muh no pi s‑ha doꞌibiamk.
<sax> Am I just speaking from a human point of view? Doesn't the law say the same thing? ||| Pi o d wabsh hemajkam hab ha‑elida ihda. An o hab chuꞌig heg eda Jiosh chehanig
<sax> To those who don't operate according to the law, I behave like them, (though not disregarding God's law, but operating under the law of Christ), so that I might gain those who don't observe the law. ||| ch am ha oidch hab ni‑junihim hegam mo pi am hu oid mani hekid i ha wehmaj mant hekaj ab wo i ha nohnogi Christ wui. K eda pi hab mahs manis pi ab hu wecho g Jiosh chehanig nani pi am hab junihim mo haschu ab i ni‑chehani g Christ.
<sax> and drank the same spiritual drink, for they “drank from a spiritual rock” that accompanied them. That rock was Christ. ||| ch wehsijj ab ihꞌe hegai shuhdagi mash ab geꞌe waw t amjed daꞌiwuni ch s‑wawinig. Ihda waw o wepogidas g Christ mo g doakgaj chum hebai ha wehmaj ch ab ha mahkch g hoꞌigeꞌidalig.
<sax> So my good friends, stay away from idol worship. ||| Pegih, ni‑wepnag mani si em‑tatchua, pi g ab hu wui wo shaꞌi e hoꞌigeꞌidahunad hegai mo haschu pi d Jiosh.
<sax> You shouldn't look out for yourself, but for your neighbor. ||| Am g wo s‑chegitok g chum hedai ha‑apꞌedag ch pi wabsh hejel e‑tatchui.
<sax> I'm grateful that you always remember me and that you are keeping to the teachings just as I passed them on to you. ||| Ab ani si has em‑elid mamsh chum hekid s‑ni‑chegito ch am oidch hab e junihim ihda himdag mant am em‑wui uꞌapa.
<sax> Judge for yourselves: is it appropriate for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered? ||| Am g wo oidahid ihda mo pi hab chum chuꞌig mas g uwi ab wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahu Jiosh wui pi ab hu maꞌishch g e‑moꞌo.
<sax> For I received from the Lord what I passed on to you: the Lord Jesus on the night he was betrayed took some bread. ||| Am ani wa em‑mashcham hegai mo wa g t‑kownalig Jesus am ni‑tashogid ab amjed ihda chemait hugi himdag.

<sax> Now about “spiritual gifts.”  My brothers and sisters, I want to explain this to you. ||| Ab am wa ep ni‑kakke ab amjed hegai gewkdag mo g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ab t‑mahkch matt ab aꞌai wo i t‑wehmajk. Tatchua ani mamt wo s‑mahchk g wohokam ab amjed ihda.
<sax> But all of these gifts are the work of the one and the same Spirit, sharing with each person as he alone chooses. ||| Neh, wehs ihda o ab d amjedkamaj g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. K heg ab heheꞌejel t‑mahkch mo has i mahs chikpan am hab s‑junimk ab gai t‑wuhshanim.
<sax> Quite the opposite: some of those parts of the body that seem the most insignificant are the most essential. ||| Haꞌi o pi gewpkdag g hab t‑chuhchuꞌidag ch wabshaba hab wa masma d si t‑tatchui.
<sax> If I were to have eloquence in human languages—even the language of angels—but have no love, then I would only be an echoing gong or a clashing cymbal. ||| Neh, ttp hems wo t‑nako matt wo neneokad g nahnko mahs oꞌodham ha‑neꞌokikaj o chum hems g anghil ha‑neꞌoki. T wabshaba hegai t‑neꞌoki heg wo wa wepok mo g s‑nakosig haꞌichu am e gew mattp pi wo edgidad g pihk elidadag.
<sax> Trust, hope, and love last forever—but the most important is love. ||| Pegih, chum att hekid ab wo s‑wohochudad g Jiosh ch ab s‑ap wo nenidad mat am hab wo i junihid g e‑neꞌoki am t‑wehhejed. Chum att hekid wo si pihk t‑elidad ha hekaj. K g pihk elidadag wehs ha baꞌich d i si s‑has haꞌichu.
<sax> There are surely many languages in this world, and there is meaning in every one of them. ||| Muꞌij o g nahnko mahs neꞌoki id dahm jewed.
<sax> Brothers and sisters, don't think like children. Be as innocent as babies in regard to evil, but be grown up in your understanding. ||| Aꞌalkaj am hab e junihim, ni‑wepnag, ab si haꞌichuchudch ihda al mahkigdag ch heg hekaj ab si e haschud.

<sax> However if a special revelation comes to someone who is sitting down, then the first speaker should give way to them. ||| Kumt wabshaba wo haꞌasa neo matp g Jiosh am hema ep wui wo haꞌichu i tashogi mat am hab wo chei.
<sax> Just make sure everything done is done properly and in an orderly manner. ||| Wehs amt haꞌichu si s‑ap am hab wo junihid e‑namki ed ch pi wabsh wo has hu e wuad.
<sax> So whether it's I or them, this is the message we shared with you that brought you to trust in God. ||| K g Jiosh hab waꞌap i ha wehmt hegam mo ni‑wehm d piongaj g Jiosh. Wehsijj ach heg am wa ahgachug. K d ihda haꞌichu t‑ahga mam ab s‑wohochud.
<sax> As for us, why do we place ourselves in danger hour after hour? ||| Wehs tashkaj ach pi shaꞌi huwid g t‑doakag ahchim mach am ahgachug g doꞌibiadag. Kutt pi am hab wo t‑junihid matp pi ab hu wo i wuwha g koꞌi.
<sax> There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies. Heavenly bodies have one kind of beauty, earthly bodies another. ||| Tash ch mashad ch huhuꞌu o gawul masma mo g jewed ch gawul masma s‑kehgaj.
<sax> in a moment, in the blink of an eye, at the sound of the last trumpet. The trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised never to die again, and we will be changed. ||| Kut id si s‑hohtam hab wo e juh hab masma mam si s‑hohtam e wuhigid.

<sax> and I may stay with you for a while, perhaps spend the winter, and then you can send me on my way to wherever I'm headed. ||| k antp hems wehs s‑hehpchꞌed oidam am wo em‑wehmajkahim. Mt am haha wo i ni‑wehmt mantp hebai baꞌich wo i hih.
<sax> to respect their leadership, and everyone who helps the work with such dedication. ||| mamt ab wo ha kaihamad hegam mo hab masma em‑wanimed mo idam ch hegam mo hedai ha wehm chikpan.
<sax> We're writing to tell you about this in order to make our happiness complete. ||| Kuni am em-oꞌohanid ahpim mam ab s-wohochud mamt hekaj wo si s-ap e tahtkkad. Nt ahni hab waꞌap wo si s-ap ni-tahtkkad em-wehm.
<sax> Anyone who says, “I know him,” but doesn't do what he says, is a liar. They don't have the truth. ||| Hegai mat pi am hu oidk hab wo e junihid g Jiosh chehanig o pi mahch g Jiosh, chum as hems hab wo chum chei mo s-mahch.
<sax> Don't be in love with the world, and don't long for the things of this world. If you love the world, you won't have the Father's love in you. ||| Pi g wo shaꞌi si pihk e elidad heg ab mo d wabsh jewed t ab haꞌichu. Hegam matp hedai wo si pihk e elidad id ab haꞌichu at pi wo shaꞌi pihk e elidad ab Jiosh wui.
<sax> Eternal life—this is what he has promised us! ||| Heki o hu hab kaij g Jiosh matsh ab wo t-mah ihda wechij doakag matsh pi hekid wo huhug.
<sax> All those who live in him don't go on sinning; all those who keep on sinning haven't seen him and haven't known him. ||| Pi att am hu hab wo chum junihid g pi apꞌekam mattp ab wo s-wohochudad g Jiosh alidag. Hegai mat hedai hab wo junihid g pi apꞌekam oki pi mahch g Jiosh alidag.
<sax> This is how we will know that we belong to the truth, and how we will set our minds  at rest before God ||| K heg hekaj tasho mach edgid g wohokam. Id att hekaj ab wo i t-gewkemhu matt ab wo i miabi g Jiosh.
<sax> They belong to the world, so they speak like people of the world, and the world listens to them. ||| Hegam o ab wabsh jewed t ab haꞌichu k amjed neneok. K hegam ab ha kaiham mo hab waꞌap pi mahch g Jiosh.
<sax> We have experienced and trusted in the love that God has for us. God is love, and those who live in love, live in God, and God lives in them. ||| Kuch heg hekaj s-mahch mo si pihk e elid g Jiosh ab t-wui ch ab si t-hemakojidch e wehm.
<sax> He is the one who came through water and blood, Jesus Christ. He did not only come by water, but by water and blood.  The Spirit gives evidence to confirm this, for the Spirit is the truth. ||| Jesus Christ at ia jiwia jewed dahm k e pahl wakon k am hab juh g e-chikpan k am hahawa e muhkid am t-wehhejed.
<sax> We recognize that those who are born of God don't keep on sinning. The Son of God  protects them and the devil cannot harm them.  We know that we belong to God, and that the world is under the power of the Evil One. ||| S-mahch ach mo g Jiawul edgid g gewkdag am wehs ha dahm hegam mo pi d Jiosh aꞌaliga. Kuch eda ahchim d Jiosh aꞌaliga. Jiosh alidag o t-nuhkud. Kut pi wo shaꞌi e nako g Jiawul mas gam hu hab wo i t-juh ab amjed. Pi att am hu hab wo junihid g pi apꞌekam ahchim mach d Jiosh aꞌaliga.
<sax> Your reward for trusting in him is that you will be saved! ||| Jiosh at em-doꞌibia namt pi ab i s-wohoch g Jesus Christ.
<sax> You were set free by the costly blood of Christ, who was like a lamb with no flaw or defect. ||| Am o t‑tashogid g Jiosh mat has masma wo t‑doꞌibia am t‑chehanich mattsh wo mua g si s‑kehg kahwal k ab wui wo iagchul.

<sax> As Scripture  says, “See! I'm setting in Zion its main cornerstone, specially-chosen and valuable. Whoever trusts in him will not be disappointed.” ||| Id ani hab kaij no pi an oꞌohanas mo g Jiosh hab kaij:
<sax> For this is what grace is: to endure life's pain and unfair suffering, keeping your focus on God. ||| Kut g Jiosh ab wo s‑em‑hoꞌigeꞌidad. S‑apꞌe o mamt s‑ap wo nako g shoꞌigchudadag s‑chegitokch g Jiosh.
<sax> like Sarah who obeyed Abraham, and called him “lord.” You are her daughters if you do what's right and are not intimidated. ||| Sarabad o wa hab chuꞌig ch ab s‑wohog elid g Abrahambad mo heg d ha‑wanimeddam am ha‑kihdag ed. Kumt ahpim Jiosh wohochuddam uꞌuwi am hab wo junihid g s‑apꞌekam ch pi haꞌichukaj wo e kudutad. T heg wo wa wepok mam d Sarabad amjedkam.
<sax> Jesus died because of sins, once and for all, the One completely true and right for those who are bad, so that he could bring you to God. He was put to death in the body, but he came to life in the spirit. ||| Jesus Christ o d hekia s‑apꞌekam ch wa eda e shoꞌigch. Pegih, tt ahchim hab waꞌap wo t‑shoꞌigch.
<sax> so that although they were rightly judged as far as being sinful human beings is concerned, they could live in the spirit as far as God is concerned. ||| E ash wa ahgahim g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahga chum hems wa hegam ha wui mat idani heki hu koi matp hems ab wo bei g pi ha huhugedam doakag k an haha wo wehmajk g Jiosh.
<sax> but if it's as a Christian, then you don't need to be ashamed. Instead praise God that you're called by that name! ||| Mt ab wo si i hoꞌigeꞌel g Jiosh k pi has wo e el mamtp wo sha e shoꞌigch heg hekaj mam ab si ihm g Christ.
<sax> After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace who called you into his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore you, support you, strengthen you, and give you a solid foundation. ||| Jiosh at ab i em‑gawulkai mamt ab wo i s‑wohoch g Jesus Christ k chum hekid wehmaj wo edgidad g si s‑kehg apꞌedag. Kumt al haꞌas wo i taht g shoꞌigdag. T g Jiosh ab wo em‑mah g gewkdag k hab wo em‑juh mamt wo geꞌegeꞌehogat k s‑wihnam wo gegokkad.
<sax> So you have become an example to all the believers in Macedonia and Greece! ||| An amsh e wehgaj ha chehgidch g e-wehm wohochuddam mat has wo chum masmak. Muꞌijj ash ab em-amjed haꞌichu mahchim hegam mo am kih Macedonia ch Greece jejewed ch ed.
<sax> but instead we acted kindly among you, like a mother caring for her own children. ||| Bo hi wa chum mahs mamt ab wo si has t-elidad ch haꞌichukaj wo i t-wehmtad ahchim mach d Jesus chuhchai. Kuch wabshaba pi am hu t-gahgid ihda nach pi si s-hemajim ab em-neid hab masma mat g ha-jeꞌe ab wo ha neidad g e-aꞌaliga.
<sax> We really wanted to come and visit you, and I, Paul, tried again and again—but Satan stopped us. ||| ch am ha hekaj chum si i t-nako matt am uhpam wo hihi em-wui. Ahni Paul ant muꞌikko am chum uhpam s-himim. T am ni-kuh g jijawul ha-geꞌejig Satan.
<sax> Night and day we pray with all our hearts, hoping to see you again face to face, and to help you continue developing your trust in God. ||| Chum ach hekid ab tahni g Jiosh wehs t-ihbdagkaj matt wo wa ep em-neid k ab wo i em-wehmt mamt s-ap ab wo s-wohochudad g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.
<sax> For God did not call us to live impure lives, but holy lives. ||| Jiosh at pi hab ahgk ab i t-gawulkai machs am hab wo junihid g s-uam haꞌichu. Do tatchuij matt d wo hekia s-apꞌekamk.
<sax> Then those of us who are alive and still here will be carried up together with them into the clouds, and we shall meet the Lord in the air. Then we will be with the Lord forever! ||| T hegam mat hedai in d wo kia dodakamk heg i tash ed ab haha wo i e hemapai ha wehm chewagi ch ed k an wo nam g t-kownalig. Kutt am i amjed chum hekid wo wehmajk g t-kownalig.
<sax> For God hasn't placed us in a position to be punished, but has reserved us for salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ. ||| Pi at hab ahgk ab i t-gawulkai g Jiosh mas wo t-namkid heg hekaj pi ap t-chuꞌijig k wabshaba hab ahgk mat g t-kownalig Jesus Christ wo t-doꞌibia.
<sax> Don't hold the Spirit back, ||| Pi g am hu wo shohbid g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag.
<sax> I'm sending it to you Timothy. You are my true son because of your trust in God. May you have grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. ||| Ab g ni-kaiham ahpi Timothy map d ni-alidag ab i s-wohochudk g haꞌichu ni-ahga ab amjed g Jesus Christ.
<sax> Even though I used to insult God, and persecuted and abused God's people, God showed me mercy because of my ignorance and unbelief. ||| Heki anid hu wa ha shoꞌigchud hegam mo ab s-wohochud g Jesus ch ab ha wui pi ap has ahg g Jesus. Kut eda heg ab si i s-ni-hoꞌigeꞌel nani pi pi ni-mahch ch hab junihim pi ab hu wohochudch.
<sax> He wants everyone to be saved, and come to understand what truth really is. ||| ch tatchua mat wehs nahnko mahs hemajkam wo e doꞌibia k wo s-mai g wohokam ab amjed.
<sax> Adam wasn't deceived, but Eve was completely deceived, and she fell into sin. ||| Kush pi d Adambad mat e iattogi. Hegai uwi atsh e iattogid k melchkwua g Jiosh chehanig.
<sax> They must stick to the revealed truth about God, trusting in him with a pure conscience. ||| Do si haꞌichu mat am wo si wehs s-ap oidad g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch heg hab wo waꞌi junihid mo haschu s-mahch mo d s-apꞌekam.
<sax> Everything created by God is good, and nothing should be rejected but should be received with thanks, ||| Jiosh at wehs haꞌichu nahto. K wehs s-kehgaj. Tt hekaj ab wo i hoꞌigeꞌid k ab wo ui.
<sax> Don't neglect the gracious gift you have that was given to you by prophetic inspiration when the church elders laid their hands on you. ||| Neh, ha wanimeddam at was e hoꞌigeꞌidahu m-wehhejed k ab m-taht. T wa hegam mo d Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam am ah mat has mahs chikpan ab m-mah g Jiosh. Pegih, am g i e nakogad ch heg am hab wo junihid.
<sax> But those who don't look after their relatives, especially their own family, have denied their beliefs, and are worse than those who don't believe. ||| Hegam mat pi wo ha nuhkud g e-hajuni o baꞌich d i pi apꞌekam mo g mischini.
<sax> Censure those who sin in front of everyone as a warning to others as well. ||| Am apt hemajkam ha kailid k wo si s‑ha kehꞌel hegam mat hedam pi gam hu wo dagito g pi apꞌekam. T hab masma wo s‑e gihugad haꞌi ehp.
<sax> But if we have food and clothes then that's enough for us. ||| Heg o am wa chum s‑apꞌe am t‑wehhejed matt ab wo wa al heꞌes haꞌichu koꞌad ch ab s‑ap wo t‑enigadadch.
<sax> In this way they store up treasure that will provide a solid basis for the future, so that they can take hold of true life. ||| Bo masma heg wa wepo mo e toꞌidahim g s‑namkig haꞌichu an dahm kahchim ch ed hekaj wo si s‑ap tahtkkad chum hekid.
<sax> In fact it was like a death sentence inside us. This was to stop us relying on ourselves and to trust in God who raises the dead. ||| Bo wa sha tahhadag mant ni-lodaitachud k hemho wa wo ni-muꞌij. Id atki hab ahgk hab e juh matt pi ab hu hejel wo t-hiwgad ch wabshaba heg waꞌi Jiosh ab wo si hiwgad. Heg o ab i ha wuwhasid g koꞌi muhkig amjed
<sax> However many promises God has made, in Christ the answer is always Yes. Through him we respond, saying Yes to the glory of God. ||| Wehs at am hab t-juni g Jiosh g hab e-elida am gahi wuhshanim g Jesus Christ. Kutt heg gahi wuhshanim ab wo si hehgchulidad g Jiosh.
<sax> so now you should forgive him and be kind to him. Otherwise he may sink into despair. ||| Mt hahawa ab wo i s-hoꞌigeꞌid k ab wo i gewkemhu nat pi has e juh k am hu wo si pi ap e tahtam k wabsh si s-wohom gm hu hab wo i e juh.
<sax> Are we starting to speak well of ourselves again? Or do we need to have some letter of recommendation for you, or from you, as some people do? ||| Pi ani wabsh hejel ni-wohokamchud mani d kehshaj g Christ ch pi tatchua mams ab wo ni-wohokamch g oꞌohanakaj.
<sax> Since we have such a confident hope, we are truly bold! ||| Id ach ab ab t-gewpkadch ch hekaj am si s-t-mahch ch ahgachug.
<sax> The god of this world has blinded the minds of those who don't trust in God. They can't see the light of the good news of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God. ||| Jiawul o geꞌe gewkdag id dahm jewed ch daishch g ha-amichudadag.

<sax> So we don't give up. Even though our physical bodies are falling apart, our inner selves are being renewed daily. ||| Heg att hekaj pi hekid haꞌichukaj an hu wo t‑shohbi matt am hab wo junihid ihda chikpan. Ab o hi wa chum aihim g muhkig g t‑chuhkug nach pi hekitahim. K wabshaba g t‑doakag wehs tashkaj ab i e wechijid.
<sax> That's why our goal, whether home here in our bodies or not, is to make sure we please him. ||| K wabshaba pi has d shaꞌi ahga machs hebai hab chuꞌig. Id o baꞌich d i si haꞌichu matt am hab wo juh g tatchuij, chum achs ia wo haꞌichugk id dahm jewed o an wo wehmajk anai.
<sax> For God was in Christ bringing the world back from hostility to friendship with him, not counting anyone's sins against them, and giving us this message to change his enemies into his friends. ||| Id o d haꞌichu ni‑ahga mat g Jiosh ab chum i ha nawojt g hemajkam k gam hu hab i juh g ha‑chuꞌijig heg hekaj mat g Christ haschu hab juh ha wehhejed.
<sax> Dear friends, since we have these promises, we should wash ourselves clean from all that makes both body and spirit dirty, aiming for complete holiness out of reverence for God. ||| Neh, id ash hab kaij g Jiosh, ni‑wepnag, mat am hab wo t‑juni.

<sax> Even though I may seem to be boasting a little too much about our authority, I'm not embarrassed about it. The Lord gave this authority to us to build you up, not to knock you down. ||| Pi ani shaꞌi si ni‑elid am heꞌes i em‑ahgidch ab amjed ihda gewkdag mat g t‑kownalig Jesus ab ni‑mah.

<sax> I robbed as it were other churches, taking pay from them so I could work for you.  When I was there with you and needed something, I wasn't a burden to anyone because the believers who came from Macedonia took care of my needs. I was determined never to be a burden to you and I never shall. ||| Tatchua ani g lial ch wabshaba pi tatchua manis wo em‑wechhu.

<sax> I urged Titus to go and see you, and I sent another brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? No, we both have the same spirit and use the same methods. ||| K hegam wabsh s‑ap haꞌichu hab elid ch am hab e junihim mani ahni has i masma.

<sax> But God rescued Lot because he was a good man, sickened by the disgusting immorality of his neighbors.  (Lot lived among them, but he did what was good and right.

<sax> Now we want to tell you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, not to associate with any believer who can't be bothered to work for their living—those who don't follow the teachings they learned from us. ||| Heki ach hu em-mashcham mamt wo s-wapagimak.

<sax> This is what you should remind people about, telling them before God that they shouldn't have meaningless arguments over words.

<sax> My friend, I pray most of all that you're doing well and are in good physical health, for I know you're doing well spiritually.

<sax> God performed unusual miracles through Paul, ||| Kush g Jiosh am si i wehmaj g Paul mash am hab junihim g s‑hasigam haꞌichu.

<sax> But I don't consider my life as worth anything to me. I only want to finish my mission and the ministry that the Lord Jesus gave to me, to witness to the good news of the grace of God. ||| Pi o d shaꞌi haꞌichu g ni‑doakag manis wo si s‑huwidad hejel ni‑wehhejed.

<sax> Some of the believers from Caesarea came with us, and they took us to the home of Mnason, where we were going to stay. He came from Cyprus and was one of the early believers. ||| T am haꞌi t‑oi Jerusalem wui k am i t‑ui heg kih wui matt am wehmaj wo dadhaiwua.

<sax> So Paul took the men with him, and the next day went and purified himself with them.

<sax> When he said this, a tremendous argument broke out between the Pharisees and Sadducees that split the council. ||| T id am i kah g e jehnigiddam k am ha hekaj aꞌai e neꞌowin k pi ab hu i e wehmt.
<sax> Paul called over one of the centurions, and told him, “Take this young man to the commander, because he has some information to share with him.” ||| Tsh heg am hema wai g shondal ha‑geꞌejig k hab kaij ab wui, “Am g behꞌi ihda wechij oꞌodham am si uhgchu shondal ha‑geꞌejig wui, matsh wo haꞌichu ahgi.”

<sax> When Paul was summoned, Tertullus began making his case against him. He said, “Your Excellency Governor Felix, we have enjoyed a long period of peace under you, and as a result of your wise judgment reforms have been enacted for the benefit of the nation. ||| T am wai g Paul.

<sax> Felix who was well-informed about the Way then adjourned the trial. “When Lysias the commander comes I will make my decision regarding your case,” he said. ||| Felix o si s‑ap s‑mahch ihda Jesus himdag.

<sax> After staying there with them for no more than eight or ten days, Festus returned to Caesarea. The following day he took his seat as judge, and ordered that Paul be brought before him. ||| K am dakahim g Festus am hu i hemako domig k gam hu hahawa hih Cesaria wui.

<sax> But I don't have anything specific to write about him to His Imperial Majesty. That's why I have brought him before you so I can have something definite to write.  It doesn't seem fair to me to send on a prisoner without explaining the charges made against him.” ||| Ni wabshaba pi ni‑amichud mant haschu am wo oꞌohani g si geꞌe kownal ab amjed.

<sax> That's why one day I was on my way to Damascus with the authority and orders from the chief priests. ||| “Kunid wa ab si ha tai g uꞌugchu papal g ni‑apꞌedag k am hih Damascus wui heg wa si hekaj mant wo ha kuh hegam mo s‑wohochud mo hegai Jesus d Jiosh si Kehsha.
<sax> God has looked after me so I can stand here today as a witness to everyone, both to ordinary people and to those who are important.

<sax> We hadn't seen the sun or the stars for many days as the storm beat down on us; so any hope of our being saved was lost. ||| Kutt muꞌi tashkaj pi shaꞌi nei g tash tonlig o g huhuꞌu. K am wabsh i med g s‑gewk hewel. Tt am hu hebai hab haha wabsh i t‑ah mattki pi wo shaꞌi t‑doꞌibia.

<sax> So they cut the anchor ropes, leaving the anchors in the sea. At the same time they untied the ropes holding the rudders, raised the foresail to the wind, and made for the beach. ||| T hekaj am si hikkumia g wupulshpadaj. T im hu shul shuhdagi ch ed.

<sax> Three days later Paul invited the Jewish leaders there to come to see him. When they were all together he told them, “Brothers, even though I had not done anything wrong against the people or the customs of our forefathers, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Roman authorities. ||| Muꞌi o am kih g Tutuligo.

<sax> And even though you were dead because of your sins and being physically “uncircumcised,” he brought you to life together with him. He has forgiven us all our sins.  He wiped out the record of our debts according to the Law that was written down against us; he took away this barrier  by nailing it to the cross. ||| Neh, ahpim mam d gawul mahs hemajkam ch pi edgid g t-chehanig am wa si gawulkdas ab Jiosh t amjed heg hekaj pi ap e-chuꞌijig.

<sax> All of us were once like that, our behavior determined by the desires of our sinful human nature and our evil way of thinking. Like everyone else, in our nature we were children of anger. ||| Wehsijj ach hab wa masmakahim ch am hab junihim g hejel pi ap hab t-elida. K wa ab t-wui him g s-koꞌok t-namkidadag.

<sax> Even so, my face wasn't known to those in the churches of Judea. ||| K eda pi ni-mahch hegam mo ab ihm g Jesus ch am kih Judea jewed ch ed.
<sax> However when Peter came to Antioch I did have to confront him directly, because he was clearly wrong in what he did.  Before some of James' friends arrived, Peter used to eat with the foreigners. But when these people came he stopped doing this and stayed away from the foreigners. He was afraid of being criticized by those who insisted that men had to be circumcised. ||| Am ani wa kih Antiok kihhim t am ch am ha ahgid g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.

<sax> Now the promises were given to Abraham, and to his son. It doesn't say, “sons” as if plural, but singular: “and to your son,” meaning Christ. ||| Pegih, k ab si ahꞌad g Jiosh g Abrahambad mat wo ha doꞌibia g nahnko mahs hemajkam am hema gahi wuhshanim g Abrahambad amjedkam. Kuki heg hab ahg Christ.
<sax> For you are all God's children through your trust in Christ Jesus.  All of you who were baptized into Christ have clothed yourselves with Christ. ||| E amt pahl wapko mamt am wo e chehgi mamt ab i s‑wohoch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga k ab bei g alidaj.

<sax> The Son is the radiant glory of God, and the visible expression of his true character. He sustains everything by his powerful command. When he had provided cleansing for sin he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven. ||| Kutsh eda ia jiwia k e shoꞌigchud k e muhkid matsh gam hu hab wo i juh g s-koꞌok t-namkidadag mach d pi ap chuꞌijkam.

<sax> But Jesus deserves much greater glory than Moses, in the same way that the builder of a house deserves more credit than the house.  Every house has its builder; God is the builder of everything. ||| Kutt wabshaba baꞌich ab wo i si has elidad g Jesus mach g Mosesbad no pi d Jiosh ch wehs haꞌichu nahto.

<sax> Every high priest is chosen from the people and is appointed to work for the people as they relate to God. He presents to God both their gifts and sacrifices for their sins.  The high priest understands how ignorant and deluded people feel because he also experiences the same kind of human weaknesses.  As a result he has to offer sacrifices for his sins as well as for those of the people. ||| Jiosh atsh am i apꞌech matsh hema g t‑wehm oꞌodham d wo uhgchu t‑pahligk ch ab wui hab wo junihid g iagchulida ch hoꞌigeꞌidahuna am t‑wehhejed ch hejel e wehhejed.

<sax> Solid food is for grown-ups—those who by always using their brains have learned to tell the difference between good and evil. ||| Hegam mat wo geꞌegeꞌehogat e‑wohochudadag ed at wo s‑amich g Jiosh neꞌoki k wo s‑mahchk mo haschu d s‑apꞌekam ch haschu d pi apꞌekam.
<sax> We want each of you to show the same kind of commitment, confident in God's hope until it's fulfilled. ||| Tatchua ani mamt hab wa masma am hab wo junihid wehs e‑doakag oidam ch ab wo ai hegai mo g Jiosh ab t‑makiog hahawa.
<sax> We don't have any information about his father or his mother or his family tree. We don't know when he was born or when he died. Like the Son of God he continues as a priest forever. ||| Pi o an hu hebai oꞌohanas mas hedai d ha‑amjedkam g Melkisedekbad ch has masma mahsi k has masma heb hu hih.

<sax> The one we're talking about comes from a different tribe, a tribe that has never provided priests to serve at the altar.  It's clear that our Lord is a descendant of Judah, and Moses said nothing about priests coming from this tribe. ||| Heg ash pi ab hu d Levibad amjedkam ch wabshaba ab d Judabad amjedkam matsh idam pi d wo chum papalk am t‑chehanig ed. K heg hekaj tasho mat g Jiosh am gawul juh g e‑chehanig am t‑wehhejed.
<sax> He is exactly the high priest we need: holy and without fault, pure and separate from sinners, and given a place in the highest heavens. ||| Tatchua ach g si s‑ap uhgchu pahl.

<sax> Pointing out their failings, God told his people, “Pay attention, says the Lord, because the days are coming when I will make a new agreement relating to the house of Israel and the house of Judah. ||| Neh, bash kaij g Jiosh:
<sax> They're just religious regulations—about food and drink, and various ceremonies involving washing—which were put in place until the time of God's new way of relating to him. ||| Ihda heki hu chehanig o wa am ha chehgidch mat haschu wo koꞌad ch has masma wo i e apꞌechudad e lihmhunch am Jiosh wehhejed am hugkam mat hekid g Jiosh am wo i wechijid wehs haꞌichu am t‑wehhejed.
<sax> He said to them, “This is the blood of the agreed relationship that God has told you he wants with you.” ||| Kush wa hab kaij g Mosesbad:
<sax> because it's impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to remove sins. ||| Pi at hekid wo shaꞌi e nako g totolo ch siswat ha‑ehꞌed mas gam hu hab wo i juh g t‑chuꞌijig.
<sax> let us come close to God with sincere minds, totally trusting in him. Our minds have been sprinkled to purify them from our evil way of thinking, and our bodies have been washed clean by pure water. ||| Hekai ach hu t‑kudut g pi ap t‑chuꞌijigkaj.

<sax> Sometimes you were made a spectacle of, being insulted and attacked; at other times you stood in solidarity with those who were suffering. ||| Muꞌikko am s‑koꞌokam has em‑ahg ch em‑shoꞌigchud am hemajkam ha tahgio. Hebai am wa si pi ap e tahtk ha wehhejed hegam mo hab waꞌap hab masma e shoꞌigchud.
<sax> You can't expect God to be pleased with you if you don't trust him! Anyone who comes to God must believe that God exists, and that he rewards those who are searching for him. ||| Hegam at wo waꞌi s‑ha hohhoꞌidad g Jiosh mat hedai ab wo s‑wohochudad. Hegai mat ab wo i miabi g Jiosh at hemho wa wo s‑wohoch mo an hema d Jiosh ch am i e tashogid ha wui hegam mo ab s‑mahchimk.
<sax> But they're looking for a better country instead, a heavenly country. That is why God isn't disappointed with them, and is happy to be called their God, for he has built a city for them. ||| K wabshaba am e gewpkadch heg wui jewed mo baꞌich i s‑apꞌe, pej hegai dahm kahchim kihdag. Jiosh o s‑hohhoꞌid mo hab aꞌaga mo d ha‑Jioshga nat pi am heki hu nahto g kihhim ha wehhejed.
<sax> He counted the rejection he experienced from following Christ to be of far greater value than the wealth of Egypt—because he was focused on the reward to come. ||| Am ash aꞌamichud mat wo e shoꞌigch wehhejed g Jiosh si Kehsha. K wabshaba id baꞌich d i si haꞌichu am wehhejed ki g Egypt jewed s‑kaisdag no pi am wa s‑chegitog mash haschu si s‑kehg haꞌichu ab ha makiog g Jiosh g e‑hemajkamga.
<sax> Yet others suffered insults and whippings; they were put in chains and imprisoned. ||| Haꞌijj amsh wa s‑koꞌokam has ha ahg ch ha gewittan k haꞌi ha wupulsh k ged hu si ha kuh.
<sax> Be patient as you experience God's discipline because he is treating you as his children. What child doesn't experience a father's discipline? ||| Pegih, ab g wo nakogi g e‑shoꞌigdag hab masma matp hems g em‑ohg s‑gewkam haꞌichukaj wo em‑shohbi.

<sax> You remember that even when he wanted to receive the blessing later on he was refused. Even though he really tried, and cried hard, Esau couldn't change what he had done. ||| S‑mahch am matsh am hahawa chum gawul juh g pi ap e‑chegitoi k chum shoak. Tsh wabshaba g ohgaj am hahawa pi e nako mas ab wo mah g Jiosh hoꞌigeꞌidalig.
<sax> For “our God is a fire that consumes.” ||| Jiosh atsh wehs wo hugio g pi apꞌekam hab masma mat g mehi wo hugio g s‑mehidkam.
<sax> The carcasses of the animals, whose blood is carried by the high priest into the most holy place as an offering for sin, are burned outside the camp. ||| Uhgchu pahl o am iagchulid g haꞌichu doakam ehꞌed am heg eda Si Hekia S‑apꞌekam Kih mat heg hekaj im hu hab wo i juh g pi ap ha‑chuꞌijig g hemajkam.

<sax> Imagine that a man comes into your synagogue wearing gold rings and fine clothes, and then a poor man comes in dressed in rags.  If you pay special attention to the well-dressed man, and say, “Please sit here in a seat of honor,” while you say to the poor man, “Stand over there, or sit on the floor by my feet,” ||| Pi o apꞌe mamtp hema wo si s-ap dai g s-kais oꞌodham k eda hab wo ah g shoꞌigkam mat gam hu wabsh wo kehkkad o wo dahiwua jewedo.
<sax> By itself even your trust-based faith in God is dead and worthless if you don't actually do what's right. ||| Pi ach woho wohochud g Jiosh mattp pi am hu hab wo junihid g tatchuij.
<sax> All of us make mistakes in many ways. Anyone who doesn't make mistakes in what they say is truly a good person who can keep the whole body under control. ||| S‑ap at d wo oꞌodhamk ch s‑ap wo nuhkudad g e‑doakag hegam matp hedai s‑ap wo nuhkud g e‑nehni mat pi wo pi ap neo.

You've heard about the patience of Job, and you've seen how the Lord brought this to a positive conclusion—for the Lord is full of compassion and mercy. ||| nam pi s‑mahch mo g Jiosh ab ha mahkch g s‑ap tahhadkam.

<sax> He made a whip out of cords and drove everyone out of the Temple, along with the sheep and cattle, scattering coins of the money-changers and turning over their tables. ||| Kud si pi hohhoꞌi g Jesus mo id am hab e wua geꞌe cheopi t am k hekaj hema gewikudt g wijinakaj k gam hu wehs si ha shahmud g haiwani ch kahwal k am gai ha shul g ha‑mimsa hegam mo g lial kammialt k gam hu si gantad g ha‑lialiga

<sax> John was also baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was plenty of water there and people kept coming to be baptized.  (This was before John was imprisoned). ||| Md eda wenog koi kuh hegai John mad ha pahl wapkon. Sh am oimmed ch ha pahl wapkon Aenon t am miabidch g Salim kihhim no pi am ge shohshon ch s‑shuhdagig.
<sax> The Father loves the Son and has placed everything in his hands. ||| Jiosh o si pihk e elid ab e‑alidag wui ch wehs haꞌichu ab mah.

<sax> You really don't know the God you're worshiping, while we worship the God we know, for salvation comes from the Jews. ||| T wabshaba g Jiosh ab i t‑gawulkai ahchim Tutuligo mat am gai t‑wuhshanim wo e maskogi am ha wui g nahnko mahs hemajkam.

<sax> But Jesus replied, “I have food to eat that you know nothing about.” ||| D wabshaba hab kaij, “Am o haꞌichug g hab mahs gegosig mam ahpim pi shaꞌi mahch.”
<sax> They said to the woman, “Now our trust in him isn't just because of what you told us but because we have heard him for ourselves. We're convinced that he really is the Savior of the world.” ||| k hab hahawa kaij idam heg wui uwi, “B att hahawa si hejel kah k ab s‑wohochud k s‑mahch moki woho d wehs hemajkam t‑doꞌibiakam id dahm jewed.”

<sax> Immediately the man was healed. He picked up his mat and started walking. ||| Neh, d ha hekaj doa k am bei g e‑wahkus k s‑ap hih.
<sax> Jesus explained to them, “I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself; he can only do what he sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does the Son does as well. ||| D hab hahawa kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Nt wo si shel em‑ahgi mani pi haꞌichu hejel hab wua ch wabshaba hab wua mo haschu g ni‑ohg Jiosh ni‑chehani.

<sax> You search the Scriptures because you think that through them you'll gain eternal life. But the evidence they give is in support of me! ||| Am am si hoan g Jiosh oꞌohana nam pi tatchua mamt wo e doꞌibia k wo edgidad g pi ha huhugedam doakag. K g Jiosh oꞌohana am ni‑wohokamchud

<sax> Once they were all full, he said to his disciples, “Collect what's left over so nothing is wasted.” ||| D hab hahawa t‑ahg g Jesus, “An g wo i uꞌihim g ha‑wiꞌa. Kutt pi haꞌichu wo shaꞌi heki wua.”
<sax> The next day the crowd that had stayed on the other side of the sea noticed that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had not got into the boat with his disciples, but they had left without him. ||| Baꞌich i siꞌalim, d hegam hemajkam mad ab wih s‑mahch mad pi i t‑oi g Jesus no wa pi neid mo d hemako g wahlko.

<sax> As is written in Scripture by the prophets, ‘Everyone will be taught by God.’ Everyone who listens to and learns from the Father comes to me. ||| Kekelibad Jiosh Haꞌichu i tashogiddam atki wa an oꞌoha:

<sax> Jesus told them, “This is not my time to go, not yet; but you can go whenever you want, for any time's the right time for you.  The world has no reason to hate you, but it does hate me, because I make it clear that its ways are evil.  You go on to the festival. I'm not going to this festival because this is not the right time for me, not yet.” ||| D hab kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Pi ant am hu wo em‑oi id wui gegosig nat pi koi e ai mant am wo si s‑ap i ni‑maskogi.

<sax> Those who speak for themselves want to glorify themselves, but someone who glorifies the one who sent him is truthful and not deceitful. ||| Hegai mat wo ah g hejel e‑mahchig at wabsh wo chum si e haschud k atp hems d s‑chu iattomkam.

<sax> While he was teaching in the Temple, Jesus called out in a loud voice, “So you think you know me and where I'm from? However I did not come for my own sake. The One who sent me is true. You don't know him,  but I know him, for I come from him, and he sent me.” ||| D si s‑kaidam hab kaij g Jesus, “Pegih, s‑mahch am mani hedai wud ch hebaijed him.

<sax> They said this to try and trap Jesus so they could condemn him. But Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger. ||| Neh, bo kaij no pi wabsh haꞌichu s‑kaimk ch s‑abchudamk g Jesus.
<sax> Even if I did judge, my judgment would be right because I am not doing this alone. The Father who sent me is with me. ||| Kut wabshaba d wo wohokamk g ni‑ahga mant hekid wo ah mam has chuꞌig nat pi g Jiosh am ni‑wehm wo em‑aꞌappe.

But the One who sent me tells the truth, and what I'm saying to you here in this world is what I heard from him.” ||| Muꞌijj o g em‑chuꞌijig. Kunt heg wo ah.

<sax> Then Jesus told him, “Go and wash in the Pool of Siloam” (which means “sent”). So the man went and washed, and when he went home he could see. ||| k hab ahg, “Am g him k ab i wakon g e‑wuhiosha heg eda woꞌo mo hab e aꞌaga Siloam.” (K hab d ahga ihda “I Ahꞌad.”) T wa woho am hih ihda pi neadam k am wako g e‑wuhiosha k am i uhpam jiwia s‑ap haꞌichu neidch.

<sax> They shouted abuse at him, and said, “You're that man's disciple. ||| D idam ab si s‑kehꞌid ch hab kaij, “Ahpi apt ab i s‑wohoch hegai hemajkam. Ahchim ach hi g Mosesbad ab s‑wohochud.
<sax> “I trust you, Lord!” he said, and he kneeled in worship before Jesus. ||| D ab si i gei wui k hab kaij, “Ab ani si m‑hiwig, s‑apꞌekam ni‑kownalig.”
<sax> So Jesus explained again, “I tell you the truth: I am the gate of the sheepfold. ||| D heg hekaj hab ep kaij, “Ahni ani hab ni‑ahg ch ni‑wepogid g kolhai kihjeg.
<sax> No one takes it from me; I choose to lay it down. I have the right to give it up, and I have the right to take it back. This is the command my Father gave me.” ||| Pi at hedai wo shaꞌi e nako mas wabsh hejel wo e elid k wo ni‑mua. Uꞌukch ani g ni‑apꞌedag mant am wo i ni‑dagito muhkig wui k ab uhpam ep wo i ni‑chegito.

<sax> But one of the disciples, Judas Iscariot, who would later betray Jesus, asked, ||| D hab kaij hegai t‑wehm kehshaj g Jesus mo hab chehgig Judas Iscariot,

<sax> Now we're certain that you know everything, and that in order to know what questions people are thinking you don't need to ask them. This convinces us that you came from God.” ||| Ch hahawa s‑mahch map wehs haꞌichu s‑mahch. Pi o hab hahawa mahs machs hedai ab wo ge haꞌichu m‑kakke. Ch hekaj hahawa s‑wohochud map ab amjed g Jiosh.”

<sax> Then the soldiers, their commander, and the Jewish guards arrested Jesus and tied his hands. ||| D ab ha cheha g shondal g ha‑geꞌejig mat am wo i ha wehmt g cheopi nuhkuddam. D am bei g Jesus k gan hu si wulsh g nohnhoij k gam hu i wanim Jerusalem wui.
<sax> Jesus replied, “If I said something wrong, tell everyone what was wrong with it. But if what I said was right, why did you hit me?” ||| D hab hahawa kaij g Jesus, “Am g hig wehs wo ha ahgi manis haꞌichu pi ap hab kaij. Wohokam ani em‑ahgid. Pt haschu ahgk ab ni‑shonikka?”
<sax> Pilate went back into the governor's palace. He summoned Jesus, and asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” ||| D g Pilate gam hu uhpam wah e‑kih ed k ab i wai g Jesus k hab kaij ab wui, “Neh, nap hab e elid map d ha‑kownalig g Tutuligo?”

<sax> When Pilate heard this, he brought Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called Stone Pavement (Gabbatha in Hebrew). ||| D am i kah g Pilate ihda k am hahawa i wuhshad g Jesus k heg ga hu i dahiwua usagakam daikud ed amai mach hab aꞌaga Gabbatha mo an sha uhgk i hodaitas.
<sax> So they said to each other, “Let's not tear it, but let's decide who will have it by rolling dice.” This fulfilled the Scripture that says, “They divided my garments among them and rolled dice for my clothing.” ||| D id hab ahg g shondal ch hab kaij ab aꞌai e wui, “Pi att am hu aꞌai wo t‑wanchid ihda k am wabsh wo t‑chichwi matt hedai wo t‑gehg k heg wo bei.” Neh, bad kaij ch woho am hab e juh.

<sax> The two of them were running together, but the other disciple ran faster and reached the tomb first. ||| Nid ahni wehpeg ged hu mel nanid pi ahni baꞌich i s‑hohtam meh mad g Peter.
<sax> After she'd said this, she turned round and saw Jesus standing there, but she didn't realize it was Jesus. ||| Tsh hab cheꞌiok ab sikol i kekiwua k ash neid mash ab hema kehk ch ash wabshaba pi shaꞌi mahch mo hedai wud.

<sax> “I'm going fishing,” Simon Peter said to them. “We'll come with you,” they replied. So they left and went out in the boat, but all night they caught nothing. ||| D hab kaij g Simon Peter ab t‑wui, “Ih, nt hi wo sha ha uꞌim g waptopi.”
<sax> Jesus took the bread and gave it to them and the fish as well. ||| D am hih g Jesus k am bei g pahn k an i t‑hainidahim k g watopi am ep be k an i ha t‑mahkhi.
<sax> This is why the saying spread among the believers that this disciple would not die. But Jesus didn't say to him that he wouldn't die, just that “If I want him to remain alive here until I return, why is that your concern?” ||| Kudki an i e ahgidahi am ha shahgid g Jesus wohochuddam mantsh pi wo ha muh.

<sax> When eventually he came out, he wasn't able to speak to them. They realized he'd seen a vision in the Temple, for though he could make gestures, he was completely dumb. ||| Tsh am hu hebai ab hahawa i wuhshani k chum neo am ha wui k wabsh pi shaꞌi e nako.

<sax> John addressed the crowds that came to him to be baptized. “You viper's brood! Who warned you to flee from the coming judgment?” he asked.  “Demonstrate that you have truly repented. Don't try to justify yourselves by saying, ‘We're Abraham's descendants.’ Let me tell you, God can create children of Abraham from these stones. ||| Tsh muꞌi am wui e chehm g hemajkam matsh ab ab wo e pahl wapko.

<sax> Jesus went back down the mountain with them, and stopped at a place where there was some flat ground.

<sax> “What things?” Jesus asked. “About Jesus of Nazareth,” they replied. “He was a prophet who spoke powerfully and performed great miracles before God and all the people. ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “Shahchu ap hab ahg?”
<sax> But they urged him, saying, “Please come and stay with us. It's getting late—the day is almost over.” So he went to stay with them. ||| Kush wabshaba an shoshobid ch hab kaij, “Ia apt wo waꞌi jiwia t‑wehm. Hudunihim o k ch ab i s‑chuhugamhi.”

<sax> But for you it's not like this. Anyone of you who wants you to be a ruler must be your servant,  and anyone who wants to be first among you must be the slave of all of you. ||| T wabshaba pi hab masma hab wo shaꞌi chum mahsk am em‑shahgid ahpim mam ab ni‑hiwig.

<sax> From some distance away he saw a fig tree with leaves, so he went over to it to see if it had any fruit. But when he got there, he found it had only leaves, because it was not the season for figs. ||| Kush am hu hema kehk g suhna uhs.

<sax> Don't be troubled when you hear of wars nearby and wars far away. These things must happen but this is not the end.  Nation will fight against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines too. These are the beginnings of the world's birth pains. ||| T g nahnko mahs hemajkam ch jejewed ab aꞌai wo i e checheggia.

<sax> Stay awake, and pray so you won't fall into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the body is weak.” ||| ch ab wehs ha wui hab kaij, “Si g wo haꞌichu nenashanad ch ab wo tai g Jiosh g gewkdag mamt pi am hu wo shul pi apꞌekam ch ed. Chum am hi wa g s‑apꞌekam hab elid ch eda pi e nakog.”
<sax> “Am I some kind of rebel that you have come to arrest me with swords and clubs?” Jesus asked them.  “I was there with you, teaching in the Temple every day. Why didn't you arrest me then? But this is happening to fulfill the Scriptures.” ||| Sh g Jesus hab ha ahg idam hemajkam, “Wehs tashkaj ani am dahiwup ch ha mashcham geꞌe cheopi t am.

<sax> But even so their testimony didn't agree. ||| Kush idam hab waꞌap pi shaꞌi e wepot g haꞌichu ha‑ahga.
<sax> Seeing him there, the servant girl repeated to those standing around, “This man is one of them!” ||| Tsh am ep cheh g Peter hegai ha‑pionag k hab kaij am ha wui hegam mash an gegok, “Id o d ep hema hegam Jesus.”

<sax> Then Jesus groaned loudly, and died. ||| Kud am si s‑kaidam haꞌichu hab ep chei g Jesus k am hahawa i muh.

<sax> Later Jesus appeared in a different form to two other disciples who'd left to go to the countryside. ||| Sh am i dahm haꞌi gam hu hasko hihimad ch d gohk. Tsh g Jesus gawul masma am i e chehgi ha wui.
<sax> May you have grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. ||| Ab o si s-em-hoꞌigeꞌid g t-ohg Jiosh ch t-kownalig Jesus Christ ch ab wo wa baꞌich i em-mahkad g i wehmtadag ch g s-ap tahhadkam.

<sax> and because of my chains most of the Christians here have been encouraged to speak God's word boldly and fearlessly! ||| K g t-wehm wohochuddam pi haꞌichu shaꞌi ehbid ch baꞌich i s-gewkam ia ahg g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga neidch mani wabsh s-ap ab nakog g ni-shoꞌigdag.
<sax> Just be sure that the way you live your lives corresponds to the good news of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or not I can get to hear how you're doing—that you stand firm in full agreement with one another, spiritually united as you work together for the trusting faith of the good news. ||| Bamt masma wo himad g e-doakag mamt wo haꞌichuch g s-kehg haꞌichu ahga ab amjed g Christ.

<sax> So I hope to send him as soon as I see how I'm doing, ||| Hemu ant wo s-mai matp haschu has wo i mahsk am ni-wehhejed. T am haha wo hih g Timothy em-wui.
<sax> for if there was a way to rely on human nature then I myself could have that confidence! If anyone thinks they have confidence in such human things, then I outdo them: ||| Ahni ant baꞌich wo i ni-nako mo hegam mant ab wo hiwgad g chehanig

<sax> In fact, my faithful fellow-worker, let me ask you to help these women, for they worked together with me to spread the good news—as well as Clement and my other co-workers, whose names are recorded in the book of life. ||| Idam uꞌuwi o am si i ni-wehmajkahim mach wa am ahgachug g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.

<sax> It told me, “Write down in a book what you see and send it to the seven churches: Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.” ||| k hab kaij, “An g oꞌohan mapt haschu wo i nei k am haha wo ha cheha mat am wo i bei ihda oꞌohana hegam ha wui wewaꞌak dakam Jesus ihmdam amai Ephesus t am ch Smyrna t am ch Pergamum t am ch Thyatira t am ch Sardis t am ch Philadelphia t am ch amai Laodicea t am.”

<sax> Write this to the angel of the Laodicea church: This is what the Amen says, who is the faithful, true witness, highest ruler of God's creation: ||| K hab ep kaij ab ni-wui, “Am g oꞌohanid g ha wanimeddam hegam mo ab si ni-hiwig ch am kihdag Laodicea t am. T heg am wo ha ahgi mani hab kaij:

<sax> Then another angel came and stood at  the altar. He had a golden censer and he was given a large quantity of incense to add to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar that stands in front of the throne. ||| Kuki am kehk g iagchulidakud kownal daikud baꞌich.

<sax> I saw and heard an eagle flying in mid-heaven, shouting loudly, “Disaster, disaster, disaster is coming to those who live on the earth because of what is going to happen when the three remaining angels blow their trumpets.” ||| Nt am hahawa ep i nen k kah.

<sax> But the rest of humanity who were not killed by these plagues did not repent of what they were doing. They did not stop worshiping demons and idols of gold, silver, bronze, and stone—which can't see or hear or walk! ||| Kutki wabshaba hegam hemajkam mat an wih pi gam hu s-ohhod g pi ap e-chuꞌijig k ab wabsh kia ha ihm g jijawul ch ab ep ha ihm g e-jijoshchuda.

<sax> So I went to the angel, and asked him to give me the little scroll. He said to me, “Take it and eat it up. It will be sour in your stomach, but sweet as honey in your mouth.” ||| Nt am hih wui hegai anghil k ab tahni mat wo ni-mah.
<sax> Their dead bodies will lie on the open street of the great city, called Sodom and Egypt in spiritual symbolism—also the place where their Lord was crucified. ||| Tki g ha-koꞌidag am wo wehchkad wohg ch ed heg eda geꞌe kihhim mat wa amai g s-apꞌekam t-kownalig ab e naggia kots t ab.

<sax> Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of the covenant could be seen inside his Temple. There were lightning flashes, the sound of thunder, an earthquake, and a great hailstorm. ||| Kutki g Jiosh cheopi an dahm kahchim ch ed ab i e kuhpiꞌo.

<sax> They conquered him through the blood of the Lamb and through their personal testimony—they did not love their lives so much that they were willing to die if necessary. ||| “Jiosh si Kehsha at am i e dagito mat g ehꞌedaj e iagchul ab Jiosh wui.

<sax> One of his heads seemed to have suffered a death-blow, but this fatal wound had been healed. The whole world was filled with wonder at the beast, ||| Hema g moꞌoj o hab sha mahs matki wa e muhkid k wabshaba ep doa k e chegito.

<sax> He performed great miracles, even bringing fire down from heaven to earth while people watched.  He deceived those who live on the earth by the miracles he performed on behalf of the beast, ordering the people that they should make an image for the beast who had received the fatal sword wound but came back to life. ||| K id hiwgid mat am hab juh g si geꞌe s-hasig haꞌichu.

He had the eternal good news to announce to those who lived on the earth, to every nation, tribe, language, and people. ||| Ntki hahawa hema ep nei g anghil.

<sax> The Temple was filled with smoke that came from the glory of God and from his power. Nobody was able to enter the Temple until the seven plagues that came from the seven angels were over. ||| Hegai cheopi o ab wabsh i shuhdags g kuhbskaj no pi am haꞌichug g s-tondam gewkdaj g Jiosh.

<sax> and they cursed the God of heaven because of their pain and their sores, but they did not repent and stop what they were doing. ||| ch si pi kehg neneok ab Jiosh wui heg hekaj e-hihiwdag ch haꞌichu s-koꞌok ch wabshaba pi gam hu s-ohhod g pi ap e-chegitoi.
<sax> Huge hailstones, each one weighing one hundred pounds, rained down from the sky on people. The people cursed God because the plague of hail was so terrible. ||| Tki g shaꞌi si geꞌeged chea an wo i shul.

<sax> They threw dust on their heads, shouting and crying and grieving, ‘Disaster, disaster has struck the great city that made every ship-owner rich because of her extravagance!

All the birds gorged themselves on their flesh. ||| Hegai mo wa g s-toa kawyu cheshaj at ha kokda g ha-shondalig heg hekaj is-pahyo mo wa kamshch ab e-chini ed.

<sax> He measured the wall and it was 144 cubits thick in human measurements that the angel was using. ||| T g anghil am ep kuint g kolhaidag. K d gohk siant gamai chuhdp (216) tad uhgk.

<sax> In this way we can be encouraged together by each others' trust in God, both your trust and mine. ||| Ab att aꞌai wo i t-wehmt ab aꞌai kahk g t-wohochudadag.
<sax> They exchanged the glory of the immortal God for idols, images of mortal human beings, birds, animals, and reptiles.  So God abandoned them to the evil desires of their depraved minds, and they did shameful, degrading things to each other.  They exchanged God's truth for a lie, worshiping and serving creatures instead of the Creator, who deserves praise forever. Amen. That's why God abandoned them to their evil desires. Their women exchanged natural sex for that which is unnatural, ||| Jiosh o d pi ha huhugedam ch d si haꞌichu. Kutt heg ab wo waꞌi chum ihmad mo d t‑Jioshga.

<sax> What about you who call yourself a Jew? You rely on the written law and boast about having a special relationship to God.  You know what he wants; you do what's right because you've been taught from the law. ||| Muꞌijj g ni‑wehm Tutuligo o hab e elid mo s‑ap s‑mahch g Jiosh tatchui ch am hab junihim g s‑apꞌekam no pi edgid g chehanigaj.
<sax> It's not what's on the outside that makes you a Jew; it's not the physical sign of circumcision. ||| Pi o d Jiosh hemajkamga hegam mat wabsh gawul juh g e‑chuhkug g pahl hikuchkakaj.
<sax> So then, are we Jews better than others? Definitely not! Remember that we've already argued that both Jews and foreigners are under the control of sin. ||| Neh, pi o shaꞌi baꞌich i s‑apꞌe g Tutuligo mo g gawul mahs hemajkam. Wehsijj ach wa ab mohtois g pi apꞌekam. K id an t‑uꞌukch. Kutt pi hedai wo shaꞌi t‑nako machs pi hab wo junihid g pi apꞌekam.
<sax> So do we have anything to boast about then? Absolutely not, there's no place for that! And why's that? Is it because we follow the law of observing requirements? No, we follow the law of trusting in God.  We conclude that people are made right with God through their trust in him, and not from legal observance. ||| Neh, k pi haꞌichu d shaꞌi hegai machs hekaj wo chum si t‑haschudad. Pi att wo shaꞌi t‑nako machs wo i t‑apꞌech am Jiosh tahgio am hab junihidch g s‑apꞌekam. Jiosh at am wo i t‑apꞌech e wui matt hekid ab wo i s‑wohoch g haꞌichu ahgaj.
<sax> God's promise to Abraham and his descendants that the world would belong to him was not based on his keeping of the law, but because he was made right through his trust in God. ||| Jiosh ah am ha ahgid g Abrahambad ch amjedkamaj matsh am wo i ha apꞌech e tahgio k wehs ab wo ha mah g jewed kahchki matp ab wo i s‑wohoch.
<sax> When we were completely helpless, at just the right time Christ died for us ungodly people. ||| Dach wa pi ap chuꞌijkam ch pi ha gewkdag machs hab wo juh haꞌichu matt hekaj am wo i t‑apꞌech. T wabshaba g Jiosh am i apꞌech mat g alidaj e muhkid am t‑wehhejed.
<sax> Just as one sin brought condemnation on everyone, in the same way one right act gave everyone the opportunity to live right. ||| Pegih, id ani em‑ahgid mat g Adambad ab i wahki g s‑koꞌok namkidadag am wehs t‑wehhejed heg hekaj hemako pi ap e‑chuꞌijig. T wabshaba g Christ am hab juh g doꞌibiadag am wehs t‑wehhejed heg hekaj hemako s‑ap e‑chuꞌijig ch ab t‑makiog g wechij doakag.
<sax> Anyone who has died has been set free from sin. ||| Nat hig hab ep wo juh g pi apꞌekam hegai mat heki hu muh? Pegih, tt ahchim hab wa masma am i dagito g pi apꞌekam ab i s‑wohochudk mat g Christ am t‑wehhejed muh.
<sax> Thank God that though you once were slaves to sin, you whole-heartedly chose to follow the truth about God that you learned. ||| Pi apꞌekam o wa an em‑uꞌukch. Kumt wabshaba ab i s‑wohoch g wohokam ab amjed g Jiosh. Kuni id hekaj ab si hoꞌigeꞌid g Jiosh.
<sax> While we were controlled by old nature, our sinful desires (as revealed by the law) were at work within us and resulted in death. ||| Am o wabsh ha chuꞌamun g chehanig hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh. K baꞌich hab i junihim g pi apꞌekam. K g s‑koꞌok ha‑namkidadag ab ha aihim.
<sax> But if I'm saying that I do what I don't want to, this shows that I admit the law is right. ||| Id ani wa hekaj wohokamchud mo g chehanig s‑apꞌe.
<sax> The law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death. ||| Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag at t‑wulꞌo ab pi apꞌekam t amjed k ab t‑mah g wechij doakag. K pi ab hu hahawa t‑aihog g s‑koꞌok t‑namkidadag.
<sax> So brothers and sisters, we don't have to follow  our sinful nature that operates according to our human desires. ||| Pegih, ni‑wepnag, ab o d t‑wuikam matt hab wo junihid g Jiosh tatchui.
<sax> Not only creation, but we too, who have a foretaste of the Spirit, we groan inwardly as we wait for God to “adopt” us—the redemption of our bodies. ||| Ahchim mo g Jiosh ab t‑mahkch g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ach hab waꞌap shahshani ch ab si nenida mat am wo i nahto g t‑doꞌibiadag k wo wechijid g t‑chuhkug. Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag o d wehpeg mahkigdaj g Jiosh ab t‑wui.
<sax> Who can accuse God's special people of anything? It's God who sets us right, ||| T g Jiosh heg hekaj gam hu hab i juh g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig. T hab pi hedai wo e nako mas ab wo haꞌichu t‑abch.
<sax> But even before the children were born, and before they'd done anything right or wrong, (so that God's purpose could continue, proving God's calling of people is not based on human performance),  she was told, “The older brother will serve the younger one.” ||| Sh hab kaij g Jiosh ab wui g Rebeccabad:
<sax> As God said in the book of Hosea, “Those who are not my people I will call my people, and those who are not loved I will call the ones I love,” ||| Neh, bo masma an oꞌohadag heg oꞌohana ed mash hab chehgig Hosea mo hab kaij g Jiosh:
<sax> What Scripture actually says is: “The message is very close to you—it's in your mouth and in your heart.”  In fact it's this message based on trust that we're presenting. ||| Bo hig woho chuꞌig:
<sax> Now if even their failure benefits the world, and their loss profits the foreigners, how much more beneficial it would be if they were to completely fulfill what they were meant to be. ||| Pi at ap chuꞌi g ni‑wehm oꞌodham k ab ai g geꞌe shoꞌigdag T heg hekaj g geꞌe hoꞌigeꞌidalig ab hih nahnko mahs hemajkam ha wui. Ab o him g tash mat muꞌi Tutuligo ab wo i e nohnogi Jiosh wui k haꞌakia ab wo ai mo heꞌekia hab i ha elid g Jiosh mat wo ha doꞌibia. T g nahnko mahs hemajkam ab ep wo bei g geꞌe hoꞌigeꞌidalig heg hekaj.
<sax> You should recognize both God's kindness and toughness—he was tough on the fallen, but God is kind to you so long as you trust in his kindness—otherwise you'll be removed too. ||| Jiosh at wo si s‑hemajimak ab em‑wui mamtp ab wo s‑wohochudad ch wabshaba ab em‑wui wo kekiwua mamtp ab uhpam wo i e nohnogi pi apꞌekam wui. Pegih, ab g wo i oidahim ihda k an wo uꞌukchid g Jiosh hemajimatalig.
<sax> Oh how deep are God's riches, wisdom, and knowledge! How incredible his decisions, how unimaginable his methods! ||| Shoꞌo waꞌi si geꞌej g Jiosh. K g haꞌichu amichudadaj ch haꞌichu mahchigaj shaꞌi si geꞌej. Pi at hedai wo shaꞌi e nako mas hejel wo s‑mai g hab elidaj o wehs wo s‑amich mo has masma hab wua haꞌichu.
<sax> Love must be genuine. Hate what is evil; hold on tightly to what is good. ||| Pi g hab wabsh wo s‑e junimk mam ab pihk e elid hedai i ha wui ch wabshaba si s‑wohom ab si pihk e elid ab ha wui. Pi g hab wo junihid g pi apꞌekam ab hedai i wui ch wabshaba g s‑apꞌekam hab wo waꞌi junihid ab ha wui.
<sax> My dear friends, don't seek revenge, but leave it to God to execute judgment —as Scripture points out, “ ‘It's for me to dispense justice, I will repay,’ says the Lord.” ||| Pi g am wo hejel e agwuan. Jiosh at am hab wo wa em‑juni. Neh, bo chuꞌig an oꞌohanaj ed g Jiosh:
<sax> You should do this because you realize how urgent the time is—that it's high time for you to wake up from your sleep. For salvation is closer to us now than when we first put our trust in God. ||| Id att hab wo wuad heg hekaj mat mehk waꞌi hih g tash. E at ai matt ab wo si i t‑nenenashanich no pi e aihim mat g Jiosh ab wo i t‑wuwhas id amjed jewed.
<sax> None of us live for ourselves, or die for ourselves. ||| Pi ach hedai wabsh hejel t‑wehhejed in d doakam ch wabshaba Christ wehhejed in d doakam ch wo muh mat hekid hab wo i el g Jiosh.
<sax> Anyone who serves Christ in this way pleases God, and is appreciated by others. ||| Pegih, tt hab wa masma am hab wo t‑junihid am wehhejed g Christ. T g Jiosh ab wo si s‑hohhoꞌi ihda. T g hemajkam pi haꞌichu wo cheh mas ab wo t‑abch.
<sax> So accept one another, just as Christ accepted you, and give God the glory. ||| S‑ap o ab t‑neid g Christ. Kutt ahchim hab wa masma ab aꞌai s‑ap wo t‑neidad ch hab ab wo has elidad g Jiosh.
<sax> In fact I was keen to spread the good news in places that hadn't heard the name of Christ, so that I wouldn't be building on what others have done. ||| Chum ani hekid hab ni‑elid mant am wo i ahgahi ihda s‑kehg haꞌichu ahga mo hebai pi koi shaꞌi kah g hemajkam ab amjed g Christ k hab si wechij am wo i shonwuich.
<sax> Pray that I may be kept safe from the unbelievers in Judea. Pray that my work in Jerusalem will be welcomed by the believers there. ||| k ab wo tai mat wo si ni‑nuhkudad. T hab pi has wo ni‑juh hegam mo pi ab hu wohochud g Christ amai Judea ch ed. Ab g ep wo tahni g Jiosh mat am hab wo ha juh g t‑wehm wohochuddam mat ab wabsh s‑ap wo ui g t‑mahkigdag.
<sax> Give my best to Ampliatus, my good friend in the Lord; ||| Kush g Ampliatas am ep dak ch d si ni‑nawoj am Christ himdag ed.
<sax> These people are not serving Christ our Lord but their own appetites, and by their smooth-talking and pleasant words they deceive the minds of unsuspecting people. ||| Idam o wabsh hejel e wehhejed hab wua g pi ap e‑tatchui ch pi ab hu chikpanid g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ. Ho o iattogid hegam mo pi ap mahch g wohokam wabsh si s‑kehg neneokch ch s‑ap has ha ahg.
<sax> The reason I left you in Crete was for you to organize what was still needed and to appoint elders in every town, as I told you. ||| Am ant i m-dagito Crete jewed t am mapt am wo i apꞌech mo haschu koi apꞌechudas am ha shaꞌashagid hegam mo hemiap e mihshmad. Am apt wo i ha chuhcha wehs kihhim ed hegam mat wo ha wanimedad mani wa id heki hu m-chehani. Kunt am wo i m-chegitoch mat has wo chum masmak.
<sax> They claim to know God, but they prove this is false by what they do. They are detestable and disobedient, worthless for doing anything good. ||| Idam o hab kaij mo s-mahch g Jiosh ch wabshaba hab e wua mo pi mahch no pi s-ta kekeꞌidama ch pi chechkaidag. K g ha-doakag pi kehg hab mahs. K pi ab hu shaꞌi ha ab ulini mas hab wo juh g s-apꞌekam.
<sax> They shouldn't steal things for themselves, but show they are completely trustworthy so that they may rightly represent the truth about God our Savior in every way. ||| ch pi haꞌichu wo ehsidad ch wabshaba wo e chehgidahid mo s-ap d pion. Kut heg amjed am wo i e tashogi mo s-apꞌe g haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh matt heg hekaj t-doꞌibia.
<sax> not because of anything good that we've done, but because of his mercy. He did this through the cleansing of rebirth and renewal of the Holy Spirit,  which he poured out on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our Savior. ||| mat wo t-doꞌibia ab amjed g s-koꞌok t-namkidadag.
