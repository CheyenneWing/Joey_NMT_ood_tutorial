<sax> I'm always thanking God for you because of the grace of God given to you in Christ Jesus. ||| Chum ani hekid ab si hoꞌigeꞌid g Jiosh em-hekaj. Ab amt i s-wohoch g Christ. T g Jiosh ab i em-mah g geꞌe i wehmtadag.
<sax> Through him you have been made rich in everything, in all that you say and every aspect of what you know. ||| M heg hekaj s-mahch mo haschu s-apꞌe ch s-ap haꞌichu am hab junihim ch s-ap haꞌichu k amjed neneok.
<sax> In fact the testimony of Christ was proved valid in your experience, ||| Am o e chehgidch mam s-wihnam an uꞌukch g haꞌichu t-ahga ab amjed g Christ.
<sax> so that you're not missing any spiritual gift as you wait for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. ||| Kum wehs ab i neid g hoꞌigeꞌidadgaj ch ep nenida mat ep wo jiwia.
<sax> He will also keep you strong to the very end, so you will be kept right until the day of the Lord Jesus Christ.  God is trustworthy who called you to share together in fellowship with his son Jesus Christ our Lord. ||| Jiosh at ab i em-waid k ab i em-gawulkai mat hab masma hab t-juh. Kum hab si s-ap s-mahch g alidaj Jesus Christ. T g Jiosh pi hekid am hu gawul wo juh g hab e-elida k an wo t-uꞌukchid matt pi ab hu wo t-chuꞌijigch heg eda tash mat wo ha lodai g pi ap chuꞌijkam.
<sax> Brothers and sisters, I plead with you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all agree and that you're not divided. Instead develop a united attitude and purpose. ||| T-kownalig Jesus Christ o ab ni-mahkch g gewkdag mant wo haꞌichu em-cheha. Kunt hekaj wo em-ahgi mamt pi ab hu e wui wo gegokiwua k wabshaba ab wo i hemakoj g e-chegitoidag k wo s-ap e tahtkk ab aꞌai e wui.
<sax> For I have been told things about you, my brothers and sisters, by some of Chloe's people—that you are quarreling among yourselves. ||| Ia at haꞌi dada g em-wehm kihkam mo d Cloe hajuni k hab kaij mamsh pi e wehm neneok.
<sax> Let me explain what I mean. You're all making different claims: “I follow Paul,” or “I follow Apollos,” or “I follow Peter,” or “I follow Christ.” ||| Haꞌi amsh hab kaij mamsh ahni am ni-oid ch amsh haꞌi g Apollos am oid ch amsh haꞌi g Peter am oid. Kumsh haꞌi hab e elid mamsh ahpim d waꞌi wohokam oiddam g Christ.
<sax> For the message of the cross is nonsense to those who are lost, but it's the power of God to those of us who are saved. ||| Hegam mo pi d e doꞌibiakam o hab elid mo d wabsh pi haꞌichu g haꞌichu t-ahga mat g Christ ab muh kots t ab t-wehhejed. Kuch wabshaba ahchim mach d t-doꞌibiakam s-mahch mo g Jiosh hab masma ab t-chehgidch g e-gewkdag.
<sax> As Scripture says, “I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and I will wipe out the cleverness of the clever.” ||| Neh, an o oꞌohanas mo hab kaij g Jiosh:
<sax> So how about the wise, the writers, and the philosophers of this age? Hasn't God turned the wisdom of this world into foolishness? ||| Pegih, am o t‑chehgidch g Jiosh matt pi hedai wo shaꞌi t‑nako machs wo hejel t‑doꞌibia, chum achs hems haꞌichu wo s‑amichudad ch haꞌichu wo s‑mahchkad. Pi att hedai wo shaꞌi t‑nako machs wo ha neꞌowin k wo cheh g Jiosh wohokam.
<sax> Since God in his wisdom allowed the world in its wisdom not to know God, it was God's gracious plan that by the foolishness of the good news those who trusted in him would be saved. ||| Jiosh at hab masma hab t‑juh matt pi hedai wo shaꞌi t‑nako machs hejel wo s‑mai g Jiosh k wo t‑doꞌibia. Haꞌi o pi haꞌichuchud g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. K wabshaba hab d elidaj matt ab wo i s‑wohoch g haꞌichu ahgaj k hekaj wo t‑doꞌibia.
<sax> The Jews ask for miraculous signs, and Greeks look for wisdom, ||| Ni‑wehm Tutuligo o s‑hohhoꞌid mat hoꞌip nei g s‑hasig haꞌichu k haha wo s‑wohoch hegai mo hab junihim. K g gawul mahs hemajkam s‑kaimk g hemajkam haꞌichu ha‑mahchig mat hab masma wo chum s‑mai g wohokam.
<sax> but our message is of Christ killed on a cross—offensive to the Jews, and foolishness to the foreigners. ||| Ch wabshaba ahchim hi heg ahgachug mat g Christ ab muh kots t ab k hekaj t‑doꞌibia. Tutuligo o hab elid mo id wabsh chehgidch mo pi gewkdag. K g gawul mahs oꞌodham hab elid mo wabsh chehgidch mo pi haꞌichu amichud.
<sax> However for those who are called by God, both Jews and foreigners, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.  For the foolishness of God is wiser than we are; and the weakness of God is stronger than we are. ||| T wabshaba g Jiosh ab haꞌi i t‑gawulkai ahchim Tutuligo k hab waꞌap ab haꞌi i em‑gawulkai ahpim gawul mahs hemajkam matt ab wo i s‑wohoch g alidag k wo t‑doꞌibia. Hegam mo pi d e doꞌibiakam o pi ab hu haꞌichuchud ihda mat g Jiosh am hab t‑juni am gahi wuhshanim g e‑alidag. K wabshaba g Jiosh hab masma am t‑chehgidch g e‑amichudadag ch e‑gewkdag.
<sax> Brothers and sisters, remember your calling—and that this did not include many who are wise, humanly speaking; not many who are powerful; not many who are important. ||| Am g wo s‑chegitok, ni‑wepnag, mam has i masma mat eda koi ab hu i em‑gawulkai g Jiosh mamt d wo hemajkamgajk, Muꞌijj am pi haꞌichu mahch ch pi ha gewkdag ch d wabsh pi haꞌichu am ha‑nena ed g hemajkam.
<sax> so that nobody should boast in God's presence. ||| Heg o hekaj hab mahs mat pi hedai wo chum si e haschudad am tahgio g Jiosh.
<sax> It's because of him that you live in Christ Jesus, who God made to be wisdom for us. He sets us right, keeps us right, and frees us. ||| Heg at ab i t‑wehnad g Christ matt ab i s‑wohoch g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahga ab amjed. T g Christ t‑doꞌibia ab amjed g pi apꞌekam k am i t‑apꞌech wehhejed g Jiosh matt d wo hekia s‑apꞌekam hemajkamgajk, Bo masma ab t‑chehgidch g Jiosh haꞌichu amichudadag.
<sax> So as Scripture says, “Whoever wants to boast, let them boast in the Lord.” ||| Heg o hekaj an hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed:
<sax> Brothers and sisters, when I came to you I didn't try to impress you with wonderful words or great wisdom when I told you what God had to say to you. ||| Kuni ahni hi pi shaꞌi hasigamkaj neok, ni‑wepnag, mant eda am wa jiwia em‑wui am ahgachugch
<sax> I decided that while I was with you I didn't want to concentrate on anything except Jesus Christ, and that he was crucified. ||| mat g Jesus Christ ab muh kots t ab am t‑wehhejed. Kuni hab n‑ahg mant heg am wo waꞌi ahgachugad
<sax> I came to you in weakness, fearful and trembling. ||| ch heg hekaj si s‑gihug ch gigiwuk.
<sax> I didn't speak to you with persuasive words of wisdom to convince you. I just explained it all to you through the evidence and power of the Spirit. ||| K g haꞌichu ni‑ahga pi am hu hab shaꞌi kaidag matp hems g si s‑e mahchim oꞌodham haꞌichu ahga. K wabshaba g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag am wohokamchud g haꞌichu ni‑ahga.
<sax> That way your trust in God wouldn't rely on human wisdom but on the power of God. ||| Heg ani hekaj s‑mahch mo g em‑wohochudadag pi ab hu shon heg ab hemajkam haꞌichu amichudadag ch wabshaba ab Jiosh gewkdag amjed.
<sax> None of the rulers of this world understood anything about this—for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory. ||| Heg o d kownal wehs haꞌichu dahm. T eda g s‑has hahaꞌichu ab naggia kots t ab no pi pi mahch g Jiosh hab elida.
<sax> But as Scripture says, “No one has ever seen, and no one has ever heard, and no one has ever imagined what God has prepared for those who love him.” ||| An o hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed:
<sax> But God has revealed this to us through the Spirit, because the Spirit delves into the depths of God. ||| Jiosh haꞌichu hab elida o pi ta machima am t‑wehhejed. K wabshaba g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag wehs s‑mahch ch am i t‑tashogid.
<sax> Who knows anyone's thoughts except the actual person?  In the same way no one knows God's thoughts except the Spirit of God. ||| Neh, no hig pi woho mo pi hedai ep s‑mahch g haꞌichu t‑chegitoi hab masma mach ahchim hejel s‑mahch? Pegih, ch ahchim hab wa masma pi hedai ep s‑mahch g Jiosh haꞌichu chegitoi.
<sax> For we have received the Spirit from God, not the spirit of this world, so that we could understand what God so generously gave us. ||| T wabshaba g Jiosh ab t‑mah g Hekai S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag mat am t‑eda wo ulinig ch am wo i t‑tashogidad mo haschu ab t‑makiog g Jiosh.
<sax> That's what we speak about—not using words taught by human wisdom, but what the Spirit teaches. We explain what is spiritual using spiritual terms. ||| Pegih, pi att wo shaꞌi t‑nako machs am hu wo tashogi g Jiosh wohokam heg hekaj hemajkam haꞌichu amichudadag. K wabshaba g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ab t‑mahkch g haꞌichu amichudadag mach hekaj am i tashogid. T hegam wo waꞌi s‑amich mo hedai edgid g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag.
<sax> Of course people who are not spiritual don't accept what comes from God's Spirit. It's just foolish nonsense to them, and they can't understand it, because what is spiritual has to be properly examined. ||| T hegam mo pi edgid pi wo amichud k pi wo bei mo haschu ab t‑makiog. Heg waꞌi Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag o ab t‑mahkch g amichudadag matt wo s‑amich g wohokam.
<sax> People who are spiritual investigate everything, but are not placed under investigation themselves. ||| Ahchim mach edgid g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag att wo t‑nako matt am s‑ap wo i aꞌamich mo haschu am i t‑tashogidch. K hegam pi t‑amichud matp hedai i pi edgid g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag.
<sax> I gave you milk—I couldn't give you solid food to eat, because you weren't ready for it. ||| Heg o wa wepo mani g wihbi em‑iꞌichud ch pi g haꞌichu hugi em‑gegosid ab wabsh s‑bahbagi haꞌichu em‑ahgidch. Chum wa iaꞌi idani amt koi geꞌegeꞌehogat
<sax> Even now you're not ready for it, because you're still worldly. Since you're still jealous and argumentative, doesn't that show you're worldly, behaving just like ordinary people do? ||| k hab wabsh kia chuꞌig mo hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh. Neh, am am aꞌai s‑e hehgamk ch aꞌai e kawani. K id hekaj am tasho mam ha oidch hab e wua hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh.
<sax> When one of you says, “I follow Paul,” while another says, “I follow Apollos,” doesn't that show you're being so very human? ||| Haꞌijj amsh hab chechꞌe mam ahni Paul am ni‑oid ch haꞌijj hab chechꞌe mam g Apollos am oid. K id am wohokamchud mam ha wepo haꞌichu chegito hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh.
<sax> Who is Apollos, anyway? And who is Paul? We're just servants through whom you believed. Each of us does the work God gave us to do. ||| Pi ach d si haꞌichu ch d wabsh piongaj g Jiosh mamt ab t‑ab bei g wohokam ab amjed g Christ. Do Jiosh mo ab t‑mahkch g t‑chikpan. Kuch am hab wabsh junihim mo haschu ab t‑mahkch hab masma mo g oidag ch ed chikpandam.
<sax> I did the planting, Apollos did the watering—but it was God who made you grow! ||| Heg o wa wepo mani ahni am esh g haꞌichu kai am wehpeg ahgch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. K g Apollos am wapga g esha am baꞌich i ahgch. K wabshaba d Jiosh ch am i wuhshad g t‑esha mamt ab s‑wohochud k am heꞌes i oi g haꞌichu ahgaj mach am ahgachug.
<sax> So the one who does the planting doesn't count for anything, any more than the one who does the watering. The only one who matters is God who is growing you! ||| Kuch heg hekaj pi d si haꞌichu ahchim mach am eshad ch wapga am ahgch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. Jiosh o d si haꞌichu no pi heg am i wuhshad g t‑esha mam ab s‑wohochud ahpim mam kah g haꞌichu ahgaj.
<sax> The one planting and the one watering have the same goal, and both will be rewarded according to what they've done. ||| Wehs ach t‑wepo masma ahchim mach ahgachug g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga, chum achs hema wehpeg am wo ah, tt hema am baꞌich wo i ahgahi. T g Jiosh ab wo t‑mah g t‑namkidadag matt heꞌes hab i juh g chikpan.
<sax> We are workers together with God—and you are God's field, his building. ||| Pegih, dach piongaj g Jiosh g Apollos wehm. Kum ahpim d Jiosh eniga mach am em‑chikpan wehhejed g Jiosh.
<sax> Those who build on that foundation may use gold, silver, precious stone, wood, hay, or straw— ||| Neh, tp hems wo e mehi matp haschu kih wabsh g shaꞌikaj hab wo e juh.
<sax> but whatever is used to build with will be exposed. For on the Day of Judgment fire will reveal it and test it. Everyone's work will be shown for what it is. ||| Pegih, t hab wa masma wo i e aꞌappe g em‑chikpan. Mt heg hekaj si s‑ap hab wo juh
<sax> Those whose building survives will be rewarded. ||| k hab wo bei g e‑namkidadag mat hekid wo e mamche.
<sax> Those whose building is burned up will lose out. They will still be saved, but it will be like passing through fire! ||| T hi wo wa e doꞌibia matp hedai pi kehg hab juh g e‑chikpan. T wabshaba g chikpanaj wo huhug hab masma mat g shaꞌi wo meitto am mei ch ed.
<sax> Don't you know you are God's temple and that God's Spirit lives in you? ||| Heg o wa wepo mach d Jiosh cheopiga no pi am t‑eda kih g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. Id amt wo chum s‑mahchk.
<sax> Anyone who destroys God's temple will be destroyed by God, for God's temple is holy, and you are the temple. ||| Jiosh at wo padch matp hedai wo i em‑padch nam pi d enigaj ch d hekia s‑apꞌekam.
<sax> Don't deceive yourselves. If there's anyone of you who thinks they're worldly wise, they should become fools so they can become truly wise! ||| Haꞌi amtp hab i e ahg mam s‑chu aꞌamichud am ha nena ed g hemajkam. Pi g am wo hejel e iattogid. Pi at hab wo t‑elidad machs s‑chu aꞌamichud hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh haꞌichu amichudadag mattp heg an wo uꞌukchid. Am g wo i e nakog mamt an wo uꞌukchid, chum as hab wo em‑elidad mam pi haꞌichu aꞌamichud.
<sax> This world's wisdom is plain foolishness to God. As Scripture says, “He uses the cleverness of the wise to catch them out,” ||| Do wabsh pi haꞌichu an Jiosh tahgio mo haschu idam hab elid mo d haꞌichu amichudadag. T g Jiosh an wo ha wulsh heg hekaj haꞌichu ha‑amichudadag mo hab masma an oꞌohanas wehhejed.
<sax> and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's. ||| Kum d Christ hemajkamga. K heg d alidaj g Jiosh.
<sax> So think of us as Christ's servants given the responsibility for “the mysteries of God.” ||| Dach wabsh piongaj g Christ. K heg t‑nuhkudachud matt am wo i tashogi g s‑aꞌagi haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh. Kumt hab masma wo s‑t‑mahchk.
<sax> More than this, those who have such responsibilities are required to be trustworthy. ||| Ha‑pionag at heg am hab wo waꞌi junihid mo haschu g ahmoj chehani ch s‑ap wo nuhkud g e‑nuhkuda.
<sax> Personally it hardly matters to me if you or anyone else judges me—in fact I don't even judge myself. ||| Pegih, ni heg am waꞌi chikpanid Jiosh. K pi shaꞌi ni‑kudut mamtp has i masma hab wo elidad g ni‑chikpan ahpim o hedai i hemajkam. Niꞌinis hejel wo ah manis has masma hab wua.
<sax> I don't know of anything I've done wrong, but that doesn't make me right. It's the Lord who judges me. ||| Pi o haꞌichu shaꞌi ni‑kudut am ni‑chegitoi ed manis pi ap am hab junihim g chikpan am Jiosh wehhejed. K wabshaba pi id hekaj e wohokamchud manis am wabsh i si s‑ap am hab junihim. Heg o waꞌi Jiosh s‑mahch machs hedai s‑ap am hab junihim g t‑chikpan.
<sax> So don't judge anything before the right time—when the Lord comes. He will bring to light all the darkest secrets that are hidden, and he will reveal people's motives. God will give everyone whatever praise they deserve. ||| Mt heg hekaj pi ab hu wabsh si s‑hohtam hema haꞌichu wo abch mat koi wo e ai g tash. Am at haha wo t‑aꞌappe g t‑kownalig mat hekid wo jiwia k wo mahsko wua mach haschu i chegito ch haschu ahgch hab junihim haꞌichu k ab haha wo i t‑mahkhi g s‑ap has elidadag mo heꞌes ab i him t‑wui.
<sax> Now, brothers and sisters, I have applied this to Apollos and myself as an example for you. That way you will learn not to go beyond what has been written, and not in arrogance prefer one over the other. ||| Neh, id ani am em‑ahgid, ni‑wepnag, ab t‑amjed ahni ch Apollos mant am wo i em‑tashogi mamt pi am hu dahm wo i chesh hegai mo haschu an oꞌohanas Jiosh oꞌohana ed. Pi amt hedai Jiosh pionag ha baꞌich ab wo si has elidad ch wabshaba ab wehs wo ha kaihamad g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.
<sax> Who made you so special? What do you have that you weren't given? Since you were given it, why do you proudly claim you weren't? ||| Pi g wo chum si e haschudad heg hekaj mam haschu i edgid ch haschu i s‑mahch. Jiosh at wehs ab wabsh em‑mah mam haschu i edgid.
<sax> We're Christ's fools, but you are so wise in Christ! We're the weak ones, but you are so strong! You have the glory, but we are despised! ||| Ahpim am hab e elid mam d si haꞌichu s‑mahchim ab amjed g Christ ch si s‑gewpkdag ch ab d si has ha‑elida hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh. K eda idam pi kehg has t‑elid ahchim mach ahgachug g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch hab t‑elid mach pi haꞌichu mahch ch pi ha gewpkdag.
<sax> Right up till now we're hungry and thirsty. We have no clothes. We're badly beaten up, and we have no place to call home. ||| Hebai ach bihugkoꞌo ch ep tonkkoꞌo ch pi edgid g eniga. K hegam t‑gewichshulig. Pi ach hebai t‑mahch ch kih
<sax> We struggle on doing manual work. When people curse us, we bless them. When they persecute us, we put up with it. ||| ch si chikpan ch hejel t‑dagioꞌid. K hegam s‑koꞌokam has t‑ahg. Kuch ab wabsh i s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌid. T‑shoꞌigchud o. Kuch wabsh nakog.
<sax> When they insult us, we respond with kindness. Even now we are treated like dirt, the worst trash in the whole world. ||| An o ahgahim g iattogi ab t‑amjed. Kuch wabsh s‑hemajim ha wehm neneok. Bo wabsh t‑elid mach d wabsh hegai mo g hemajkam s‑ohhod ch gam hu nehnchud.
<sax> I'm not writing like this to make you feel ashamed, but to caution you as my children whom I love so much. ||| Id ani em‑ahgid mant wo haꞌichu i em‑shelini hab masma mam d si ni‑tatchuidch ni‑aꞌaliga. Pi ani hab ahgch em‑ahgid manis wo si em‑edawua.
<sax> Even though you may have thousands of Christian instructors, you don't have many fathers—it was in Christ Jesus that I became your father when I shared the good news with you. ||| Heg o wa wepo mani d em‑ohg id eda himdag namt pi ab ni‑amjed kah g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh k hekaj bei g e‑wechij doakag.

<sax> So I'm pleading with you to imitate me! ||| Kuni ab i em‑gewkemhun mamt am hab wo junihid mani wa haschu am em‑chehgid.
<sax> That's why I sent Timothy to you, my trustworthy son in the Lord who I love so much. He will remind you about the way I follow Christ, just as I always teach in every church I visit. ||| Ia o daha g t‑wehnag Timothy. Kuni am ahgid mat am wo i em‑chehgim ed k wo i em‑chegitoich matt has masma am wo himchudad g t‑doakag am wehhejed g Christ mani wa am em‑mashchamahim ch wehs ha mashchamahim mani hebai i hihhim. S‑mahch am mat heg ab ni‑amjed ab i s‑wohoch g Christ k heg wa wepo mo d si ni‑tatchuidch ni‑alidag ch am hab junihim g haꞌichu ni‑ahga.

<sax> So what do you want? Shall I come with a stick to beat you, or in love and a gentle spirit? ||| Ab o em‑ab mamt ab wo i e dagito wui g Jiosh. Nt hemho wo wa s‑em‑kehꞌel am jiwiak mamtp pi ab hu wui wo i e dagito, k wabshaba si s‑hemajim ab wo i em‑nei mamtp ab wui wo i e dagito.
<sax> I hear reports that sexual immorality is happening among you, immorality that even the foreigners don't practice. A man is living with his father's wife! ||| Am ash haꞌichu hab ep chuꞌig em‑shahgid ch d si geꞌe pi apꞌekam. Msh eda si e hahaschud. Hema ash wabsh hohnig g e‑ohgbad hohnig. Eda chump g Jiosh pi wohochuddam pi hab shaꞌi masma.

<sax> Even though I'm not physically present there, I am there in spirit and just as if I were there I've already made my judgment of the one who has done this. ||| Chum anis pi am hu haꞌichug ch eda heki hu hab i n‑ah mat ihda oꞌodham hemho wa gam hu wo i e wuhshad,

<sax> You shouldn't be proud about this. Don't you know that it only takes a little yeast to make the whole batch of dough rise? ||| Pi o apꞌe mams hab wo chei mam wabsh si s‑apꞌe mo eda an haꞌichug g pi apꞌekam am em‑shahgid.

<sax> In my previous letter I wrote that you should not associate with immoral people.  I wasn't referring to the immoral people of this world, those who are greedy and cheat others, or those who worship idols, otherwise you'd have to leave this world! ||| Heki ant hu wa am em‑oꞌohanid k em‑ahgid mamt pi ab hu wo ha nawojk hegam mo ha wehm woꞌiwup mo hedai pi d ha‑wehm kihkam ch hegam mo s‑bahbanma ch hegam mo melchkwuhim g chehanig kch hegam mo heg ab ihm ch ab wui e hoꞌigeꞌidahun mo pi d Jiosh ch d ha‑nahtoi g hemajkam. Pi ani hegam hab ha ahg mo pi d t‑wehm wohochuddam ch hab chuꞌig. Idam o an wehsko hab chuꞌig. Kumt pi has masma pi ab hu wo ha miabi.
<sax> What I meant when I wrote was that you shouldn't associate with anyone who is called a Christian who is immoral or greedy or worships idols; or who is abusive or a drunkard or who cheats others. Don't even share a meal with anyone like that! ||| Hegam ani wa hab ha ahg mo hab e ahg mo d t‑wehm wohochuddam ch eda am hab junihim g pi apꞌekam.

<sax> It's not my place to judge those outside the church. But shouldn't you judge those who are inside the church?  God judges those that are outside the church. “Expel the wicked from among you.” ||| Pi o ab hu t‑ab machs wo mamche g ha‑chuꞌijig hegam mo pi d t‑wehm wohochuddam. Jiosh at hab wo ha juh.

<sax> So if you have to judge things that relate to this life, how can you go to judges that are not respected by the church? ||| Pi g am wo behꞌi hegai mo pi mahch g Jiosh mas am wo i apꞌech mo haschu i pi apꞌe am em‑shahgid.
<sax> I'm trying to shame you by saying this. What? You can't find one wise person among you who can settle a dispute that you have? ||| Dat wo s‑ta edam haꞌichuk mamt aꞌai wo e lodaitad. Ab amsh si has ha elid g s‑chu aꞌamichuddam ch amtp eda pi hema cheh am e shahgid mas am wo i em‑apꞌech.

<sax> Don't you know those who are unjust will not inherit the kingdom of God? Don't be fooled! People who are immoral, worship idols, commit adultery, sexual perverts, homosexuals, ||| Mt wo chum s‑mahchk mat g pi ap hemajkam pi am hu wo i wahp Jiosh kownaltalig ed.

<sax> Some of you were once like that, but you have been made clean and holy. You have been made right in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God. ||| Haꞌijj am hab chuꞌigkahim. T wabshaba g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag gam hu hab i juh g pi ap em‑chuꞌijig k am i em‑apꞌech g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ wehhejed.
<sax> People say, “I'm free to do anything”—but not everything is appropriate! “I'm free to do anything”—but I will not let anything control me! People say, ||| Kumsh hahawa haꞌi hab chechꞌe mo wehs haꞌichu hiwgidas matp haschu wehhejed pi an hu haꞌichug g chehanig. Nt wabshaba am wo em‑ahgi mo pi wehs haꞌichu s‑kehgaj am t‑wehhejed. Pi att wo chum hiwigi mat haschu gan hu wabsh wo i si t‑ui.
<sax> “Food for the stomach, and the stomach for food”—but God will destroy both of them. Also, the body is not meant to be used for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. ||| Haꞌi amsh hab chechꞌe, “Haꞌichu hugi o ab d wuikamaj g t‑wohk ch g wohk g haꞌichu hugi ab d wuikam,” ch hab chum ahg mo wehs s‑apꞌe mach haschu i tatchua am wehhejed g t‑honshpadag.

<sax> Don't you know your bodies are parts of Christ's body? Should I take the parts of Christ's body and join them to a prostitute? Absolutely not! ||| Mt wo chum s‑mahchk mo g em‑honshpadag ab giꞌi ab g Christ ch d enigaj. Pegih, mt pi woho hab wo juh g e‑honshpadag mat ab wo i e wehnad g chehpaꞌawi.
<sax> Stay away from sexual immorality! All other sins that people commit are outside of the body, but sexual immorality is a sin against your own body. ||| Ni heg hekaj hab kaij mamt wo si e nuhkud id amjed mamt pi wabsh chum hedai wehm wo woꞌiwupad namt pi heg hekaj wo e hemakoj ha wehm k wo uamhu g e‑honshpadag k hab masma wo i e mehkod ab amjed g Christ.
<sax> Don't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit that is within you, that you received from God? ||| Mt wo chum s‑mahchk mo g Jiosh ab em‑mahkch g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. K heg am em‑eda kih. Pegih, k d cheopigaj g em‑honshpadag ch pi d wabsh hejel em‑eniga.
<sax> You don't belong to yourself—a price was paid for you! So glorify God in your body! ||| Jiosh at am i dagito g e‑alidag kots wui mat wo t‑doꞌibia. Kutt d haha wo hemajkamgajk ch heg hekaj ab wo si has i elid k wehhejed wo hekaj g t‑honshpadag.
<sax> Now about what you wrote to me: “It's good not to marry.” ||| Ia ant haha wo em‑ahgi hegai mam wa ni‑kakke ia ni‑oꞌohanidk.
<sax> However, because of the temptation to sexual immorality, it is better that each man have his own wife, and each woman her own husband. ||| K wabshaba haꞌi g ha‑tatchuidag si s‑gewkdag. K idam ha wehhejed baꞌich i s‑apꞌe mat wo e hohnt mat heg hekaj pi am hu wo i shul pi apꞌekam ch ed.
<sax> The husband should meet his wife's sexual needs, and the wife her husband's.  The wife's body doesn't just belong to her, but her husband; and similarly the husband's body doesn't just belong to him but his wife. ||| Kumt ab aꞌai e wui wo e dagito ahpim mam d e hohonikam no pi g em‑honshpadag d aꞌai em‑eniga ch pi d wabsh heheꞌejel em‑eniga. Mt hab s‑ap e tahtk ch wo e wehm kihk.
<sax> So don't deprive each other, except by mutual consent for a while— for example because you want to spend time in prayer. Afterwards be together again so that Satan won't tempt you to sin because of your lack of self-control. ||| Pi g aꞌai wo e daꞌad, heg hi wa mamtp am aꞌai wo e apꞌech mamt heꞌes i tash pi ab hu wo i e miabi mamt heg hab wo waꞌi juh hoꞌigeꞌidahuna k am hab hahawa ep wo masmak mam heki hu mat pi wo em‑gehg g ge Jiawul heg hekaj em‑tatchui.
<sax> I'm telling you this not as a command, but as a concession. ||| Pi ani ab hu em‑chehani mams wo ge hohont, heg hi wa mamtp wo tatchuad ch wo e hohont.
<sax> But if they lack self-control, then they should get married—for it is better to marry than burn with desire. ||| Mt wabshaba wo e hohont mamtp pi wo e nako mamt wo shohbi g e‑tatchui. Baꞌich o i s‑apꞌe mamt wo e hohont mamt pi wo e kudutad g e‑tatchuikaj.
<sax> These are my instructions to those who are married—in fact not from me but the Lord: The wife should not leave her husband ||| Do chehanigaj g t‑kownalig Jesus mamt pi wo ohhod g e‑wehm kihkam
<sax> (or if she does, she should not re-marry, or she should return to her husband); and the husband should not leave his wife. ||| k amtp wabshaba hab wo sha e juh k hemho wa pi hema ep wo hohnt o wo kunt k wabsh wo hejelk o an uhpam ep wo i e nodagi e‑wehm kihkam wui.
<sax> Now, to the rest of you, (and this is me speaking, not the Lord), I would say, “If a Christian man has a non-Christian wife and she is willing to stay with him, he should not leave her.  And if a Christian woman has a non-Christian husband, and he is willing to stay with her, she should not leave her husband.” For a husband who is not a Christian, the marriage relationship is made holy by the Christian wife, and for a wife who is not a Christian, the marriage relationship is made holy by the Christian husband. Otherwise it would mean your children were impure, but now they are holy. ||| Chum as pi d wo em‑wehm wohochuddamk g em‑wehm kihkam, mt pi am hu wo ha ohhod matp wo tatchuad mat an wo em‑wehmajk. Jiosh at am i apꞌech em‑wehhejed mat pi wo padch g em‑kihdag. T g Jiosh ab wo ha ui g em‑aꞌaliga mat d wo aꞌaligajk. T g em‑wehm kihkam pi wo ha padch.
<sax> However if the non-Christian spouse leaves, let them leave. In such cases the Christian man or woman is not slavishly bound, for God has called us to live in peace. ||| Mt wabshaba wo ha hiwigi mat wo s‑em‑ohhod matp wo tatchuad nam pi pi heg hekaj e wupulshch matp wo s‑em‑ohhod. Do tatchuij g Jiosh mamt wo s‑ap e tahtkkad id dahm jewed.
<sax> Wives, who knows? You may save your husband! Husbands, who knows? You may save your wife! ||| Kum pi mahch mas em‑hekaj ab wo s‑wohoch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga k wo e doꞌibia.
<sax> Apart from such cases, each of you should remain in the situation that the Lord has placed you, and continue to live the life to which God has called you. That's my instruction to all the churches. ||| Pegih, tt am wabsh wo kia oidad mattp haschu d i wehhejedkam mat hekid ab i t‑gawulkai g Christ. Id ani wehsko ha mashcham g wohochuddam.
<sax> Were you circumcised when you were converted? Don't become uncircumcised. Were you uncircumcised when you were converted? Don't become circumcised.  Circumcision doesn't mean anything, and uncircumcision doesn't mean anything. Keeping the commandments of God is what really matters. ||| Pi o has d ahga mamtp wo pahl hikuchkask o pi wo pahl hikuchkask. Kumt pi wo chum ge gawul e juh id hekaj. Heg o d waꞌi si haꞌichu matt ab wo s‑wohog elidad g Jiosh.
<sax> If you were a slave when the Lord called you, you are now free, working for the Lord. In the same way if you were called when you were free, you are now Christ's slave! ||| Am g wo s‑chegitok mat em‑wulꞌo g Christ ab amjed g pi apꞌekam, chum ams d nehol. Wehsijj ach d hahawa neneholigaj g Christ, chum hems ahchim mach pi d ha‑neneholiga id dahm jewed.
<sax> A price has been paid for you, so don't become a slave to anyone. ||| Jiosh at ab uhpam t‑uꞌapa e wui heg hekaj e‑alidag muhkig. Pegih, pi att hegai wo shaꞌi hiwigi mas wo t‑shohbi mach d piongaj g Jiosh.
<sax> Brothers and sisters, remain in the position you were in when you were called, living with God. ||| Heg o chum hekid am t‑wehmaj. Kutt am nenaj ed s‑ap hab wo junihid g t‑chikpan matp haschu wud matt eda ab i s‑wohoch ihda s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj.
<sax> Now about “people who are not married,”  I don't have a specific instruction from the Lord, so let me give you my opinion as someone who by the Lord's mercy is considered trustworthy. ||| Neh, nt am haha wo em‑ahgi mam haschu ab ni‑kakke ab ha amjed hegam mo pi ha wehm kihkam. Pi o d chehanig ihda mant wo em‑ahgi. K wabshaba ab s‑ni‑hoꞌigeꞌid g t‑kownalig Jesus ch ab ni‑mahkch g amichudadag. Kunt heg hekaj wo em‑ahgi mo haschu baꞌich i s‑apꞌe.
<sax> Because of the present difficult situation we are in I think it is best to just stay as you are. ||| Shoꞌo waꞌi si geꞌej g t‑kudutalig hemu. Kuni heg hekaj hab elid mo baꞌich i s‑apꞌe mamt am hab wabsh wo i chuꞌigk mam has i masma.
<sax> Are you already married? Don't try to get divorced. Are you unmarried? Don't look to get married. ||| Mamtp wo ge wehm kihkamk ch pi am wo ohhod o pi wo ha wehm kihkamk ch pi an hu wo hema i chum gahghi.
<sax> If you do get married, you haven't sinned. If an unmarried woman gets married, she hasn't sinned. But you will have many troubles in this current world and I would want to spare you these. ||| K wabshaba pi d pi apꞌekam mamtp an wo bei g wehm kihkam. Hi wa g hohnta at ab baꞌich wo i wuhshad g haꞌichu pi apꞌedag. Kuni heg hi wa chum pi hab elid mams ab hu wo nam.
<sax> I'm telling you, brothers and sisters, that time is short, and from now on for those who are married it may seem as if they are not married, ||| Pi o am hu geꞌe wiꞌis g tash mat ia ep wo jiwia g Jiosh alidag jewed dahm. Kuni am i em‑gewkemhun mamt wo e nahtokchid heg wehhejed. Pi g wo shaꞌi hiwgid mas wo em‑shohbi g hohnta
<sax> I would prefer you to be free from such worries. A man who is not married pays attention to what is important to the Lord, and how he can please the Lord. ||| Chum ani em‑tatchuichud mamt pi haꞌichukaj wo e kudutad. Gohkpa o kahch g t‑chegitoi matt wo ge hohnigk. Kutt wabshaba wo t‑nako matt heg am hab wo waꞌi junihid chikpan am wehhejed g t‑kownalig Jesus mattp pi wo ha hohnigk.
<sax> But a man who is married pays attention to what is important in this world, and how he can please his wife. ||| Mattp hedai wo ha hohnt k hemho wa haꞌichu am hab waꞌap wo junihid wehhejed mat wo s‑hohhoꞌidad.
<sax> As a result his loyalties are divided. Similarly an unmarried woman or girl pays attention to what is important to the Lord, so she may live a life dedicated both in body and spirit. But a married woman pays attention to what is important in this world, and how she can please her husband. ||| Kumt ahpim uꞌuwi hab waꞌap wo e nako mamt ab wo gawulkdask ch heg am hab wo waꞌi junihid chikpan am wehhejed g t‑kownalig Jesus mamtp hedai pi wo ha kunk o koi wo ha kunt. Mtp wabshaba hedai wo ge kunk ch haꞌichu am hab ep wo junihid ha wehhejed mat wo s‑hohhoꞌidad.
<sax> I'm telling you this for your benefit. I'm not trying to put a noose around your neck, but to show you the right thing to do so you can serve the Lord without being distracted. ||| Id ani hab kaij nani pi tatchua mant am wo i em‑wehmt ch pi heg hekaj manis am haꞌichukaj em‑shoshobid. Tatchua ani mamt am hab wo junihid mo haschu d s‑apꞌekam ch pi wo hiwigi mas am haꞌichu wo em‑shohbi mamt am wehs wo i e dagito t‑kownalig Jesus wui.
<sax> But if a man thinks he's behaving improperly with the woman he's engaged to, and if he thinks he will give in to his strong sexual desire, and if he thinks he ought to get married, he is not sinning by getting married. ||| Mt wabshaba wo ha hiwigi g uꞌuwi e‑aꞌaliga mat wo ha kunt mamtp hab wo elidad mo d si tatchui nat pi s‑ap geꞌegeꞌehogat. Am o wa s‑apꞌe mat am hab wo e juh.
<sax> But if a man stays true to his principles, and there is no obligation to marry, and has the power to keep his feelings under control and stay engaged to her, he does well not to marry. ||| K wabshaba am wa s‑apꞌe mamt wo ha nuhkudad mamtp hab wo elidad mo s‑apꞌe no pi pi d tatchui.
<sax> So the man who marries the woman he's engaged to does well, while the one who does not get married does better. ||| Pegih, am o wa s‑apꞌe mamt wo ha hiwigi ch hi wa baꞌich i s‑apꞌe mat pi wo ha kunt.
<sax> A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies,  she is free to marry whoever she wants in the Lord. ||| Matp hedai wo e hohont k d wo e‑wehm kihkamk am hugkam mat hekid hema wo i muh. K am hahawa s‑apꞌe mat ep wo bei g wehm kihkam, heg hi wa mat g e‑wehm wohochuddam an wo bei.
<sax> If anyone thinks they know anything, they don't know as they really should know! ||| Pi amki koi haꞌichu s‑mahch mamtp hab e elid mam s‑e‑mahch.
<sax> But whoever loves God is known by God… ||| Jiosh o s‑t‑mahch ahchim mattp ab si tatchua.
<sax> So regarding eating food sacrificed to idols: we know that there are no such things as idols in the world, and that there is only one real God. ||| Pegih, k pi d haꞌichu g ha‑jijoshga am t‑wehhejed nach pi s‑mahch mo g Jiosh d hemako.
<sax> Even though there are some things called “gods,” whether in heaven or on earth—in fact there are many “gods” and “lords.” ||| K eda muꞌi an haꞌichug g gewpkdag an dahm kahchim ch ed ch an jewed dahm mo hab e aꞌaga jijosh ch kokownal.
<sax> But for us there is only one God, the Father, from whom everything was made, and he is the goal of our existence; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom everything was made, and he is the means of our existence. ||| Ch ahchim hi s‑mahch mo d hemako g Jiosh t‑ohg. K wehs haꞌichu d amjedkamaj. Kuch heg wehhejed in d dodakam. K g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ d hemako ch wehs haꞌichu nahto. K heg gahi wuhshanim g Jiosh ab t‑mahkch g wechij doakag.
<sax> But not everyone has this “knowledge.”  Some who up to now have been so used to idols as a reality that when they eat food sacrificed to an idol, their conscience (which is weak) tells them they have defiled themselves. ||| Pegih, msh haꞌi hi wa s‑mahch mo g ha‑jijoshga pi d haꞌichu am t‑wehhejed ch hekaj pi has e elid ch wabsh koꞌa hegai mo an e toꞌaw ha wehhejed. Sh haꞌi g em‑wehm wohochuddam pi am hu s‑ap s‑mahch mo pi d haꞌichu g ha‑jijoshga no pi heki hu waꞌi amjed ab has ha elid. Kumsh koꞌa hegai mo am e toꞌaw. Sh idam am em‑neid ch am em‑oidch hab e junihim ch eda hekaj e kudut no pi hab elid mo pi apꞌe.
<sax> But food doesn't gain us God's approval! If we don't eat this food, we're not bad, and if we do eat this food, we're not good. ||| Kumsh ahpim hab kaij mo pi has d ahga am Jiosh nena ed mamt wo huh ihda. Pegih, matp pi has d ahga k ch pi haꞌichu wo heki em‑wua mamt wabsh wo dagito.
<sax> Just take care not to use this freedom you have to eat food sacrificed to idols to become offensive to those with a weaker attitude. ||| Chum as hi wa s‑apꞌe hejel em‑wehhejed mamt wo huh ch wabshaba pi apꞌe mamt wo huh matp heg hekaj wo e kudut k wo i shul hegam mo pi hab masma s‑mahch ihda.
<sax> In this way you sin against other believers, wounding their weaker consciences, and you sin against Christ. ||| Kutt wo padch mo haschu hab chum s‑junimk am ha wehhejed mattp wo heki ha himch.
<sax> So if eating food sacrificed to idols would cause my fellow believer to stumble, I will never eat such meat ever again, so that I don't offend any believer. ||| Pi att hekid wo huh matp haschukaj wo heb hu hihi g t‑wepnag mat am t‑oidch hab wo e junihid.
<sax> Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Haven't I seen Jesus our Lord? Aren't you the results of my work in the Lord? ||| Pi ani em‑ahgid mams am hab wo junihid hegai mani ahni haschu pi am hu hab wua.

<sax> Here is my reply to those who question me about this: ||| Id ani am ha ahgid hegam mo pi wohochud mani d Christ kehsha.
<sax> Don't we have the right to be provided with food and drink? ||| Ahchim mach d Christ chuhchai ach edgid g apꞌedag matt ab wo bei g t‑gegosig heg hekaj t‑chikpan.
<sax> Don't we have a right to be accompanied by a Christian wife, like the rest of the apostles, the Lord's brothers, and Peter? ||| Christ wepnag ch Peter ch haꞌi ehp g Christ chuhchai ash an uhꞌudch g e‑wehm kihkam mo eda hasko hihhim ch am ahgachug g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. Kumsh am ha dagioꞌid.
<sax> Is it only Barnabas and myself who have to work to support ourselves? ||| Bani wa masma apꞌedag. Kuch eda ahchim g Barnabas wehm pi hekaj g t‑apꞌedag ch wabsh hejel t‑dagioꞌid.
<sax> In the law of Moses it's written, “Don't muzzle the ox when it's threshing out the grain.” Was God just thinking about oxen? ||| mat g Mosesbad an oꞌoha:
<sax> Don't you know that those who work in temples receive their meals from temple offerings, and those that serve at the altar receive their portion of the sacrifice on the altar? ||| Mt wo chum s‑mahchk mo hegam mo am chikpan geꞌe cheopi ch ed ab i neid g e‑gegosig heg amjed mo g hemajkam ab mahkch g Jiosh.
<sax> In just the same way the Lord ordered that those who announce the good news should live from supporters of the good news. ||| Pegih, k hab waꞌap masma am t‑chehani g t‑kownalig Jesus hemu. Ahchim mach am ahgachug g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh attsh ab amjed wo i nei g t‑dagioꞌidadag.
<sax> But I have not made use of any of these provisions, and I'm not writing about this to suggest it should be done in my case. I'd rather die than to have anyone take away my pride in not having received any benefit. ||| Ni eda pi hekid shaꞌi hekaj ihda ni‑apꞌedag ch pi heg hekaj em‑ahgid ihda manis em‑chehani mamt wo i ni‑dagioꞌi hemu. Baꞌich i mant wo bihugim k wo muh kih hegai manis wo em‑kowlant id hekaj s‑kehg haꞌichu ahga.
<sax> I have nothing to boast about in sharing the good news because it's something I feel compelled to do. In fact it's dreadful for me if I don't share the good news! ||| Ab o ni‑chehani g Jiosh mant wo ahgachugad g haꞌichu ahgaj. Kunt wo si pi ap ni‑tahtkk mantp pi am hu hab wo junihid.

<sax> If I'm doing this work because of my own choice, then I have a reward. But if it wasn't my choice, and an obligation was placed on me, ||| Mantp ahni hab i n‑ah mant am hab wo junihid ihda chikpan ch hekaj ab wo bei g ni‑gehgewi. K wabshaba g Jiosh ab ni‑chehani ch ab ni‑hiwig.
<sax> then what reward do I have? It's the opportunity to share the good news without charging for it, not demanding my rights as a worker for the good news. ||| Pegih, k id d ni‑gehgewi mani si s‑ap ni‑tahtk heg hekaj mani ab wabsh em‑mahkch g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh. Heg ani hekaj pi hekaj g ni‑apꞌedag manis wo em‑kowlant.
<sax> Even though I am free and serve no one, I have placed myself in service to everyone so that I might gain more. ||| Pi ani hedai ha hiwig ch wabshaba wehs ha wehhejed ni‑pionchud mantp hems hab masma muꞌi ab wo i ha nohnogi Christ wui.
<sax> To those who are weak, I share in their weakness so that I may win the weak. I have ended up being “everyman” to everyone so that by using every possible means I might win some! ||| Pi ant am hab wo junihid mat haschu wo ha kudutad, chum anis s‑mahch mo s‑apꞌe am ni‑wehhejed.

<sax> Every competitor who participates in the games maintains a strict training discipline. Of course they do so to win a crown that doesn't last. But our crowns will last forever! ||| Hegai mo hedai i tatchua mat wo bei g gehgewi at hemho wa wo e momoisha k wo e nuhkud wehs haꞌichu k ed.

<sax> Now I want to explain this to you, brothers and sisters. Our forefathers lived under the cloud, and they all passed through the sea. ||| Am am wa chum s‑mahch matsh wa haschu has e juh am ha tahgio g t‑shohshon matsh wa g Mosesbad am i ha wanim.

<sax> Symbolically then they were baptized “into Moses” in the cloud and in the sea. ||| Id atsh hab ha juni mat hekaj ab wo s‑wohog elidad g Mosesbad.
<sax> However God wasn't happy with most of them, and they perished in the desert. ||| Tsh wa eda muꞌijj pi ab hu wohog el g Jiosh. Tsh hekaj si pi ha hohhoꞌi idam k ab ha hugio tohono jewed ch ed mash an oiopohim. Sh g ha‑hohon am wabsh e dagitohim.
<sax> Now these experiences are examples to us to show us we should not desire what is evil, as they did. ||| Pegih, wehs ihda o d wabsh chehgida mat wo t‑shohbi matt pi ab hu wo i tatchua g pi apꞌekam mash wa hab e wua idam
<sax> You must not worship idols, as some of them did, as it's recorded in Scripture: “The people feasted and drank, and indulged in pagan worship.” ||| ch pi ab hu wui wo t‑hoꞌigeꞌidahu mo haschu pi d Jiosh mash wa hab e wua haꞌijj idam. Bo chuꞌig an Jiosh oꞌohana ed matsh wa am dadhaiwua k huh mat haschu am toꞌi hegai mo chum jioshchud k am i wuwhag k e waila.
<sax> We must not commit sexual sins, as some of them did, and as a result 23,000 died in one day. ||| Am hu hebai ehp, sh haꞌijj wabsh chum hedai ha wehm woꞌiwup. Tsh g Jiosh am haꞌi ha cheha matsh wo ha kokda. Tsh gokko gamai waik mihl (23, 000) e koꞌij hemako tash ed.
<sax> Nor should we push God to the limit, as some of them did, and were killed by snakes. ||| Am hu hebai ehp, tsh haꞌijj bagach g Jiosh. Tsh heg hekaj am apꞌech matsh wo ha kiꞌikka g kohkꞌoi k wo ha hugio.
<sax> Don't complain at God, as some did, and died at the hands of the destroying angel. ||| Am hu hebai ehp, sh haꞌijj pi ap has ahg g Jiosh hab kaijch mash pi ap ha dagioꞌid. Tsh heg hekaj am apꞌech matsh g anghil wo ha hugio. Mt heg hekaj pi am hu ha oidch hab wo e junihid.

<sax> So if you think you're strong enough to stay standing—be careful you don't fall! ||| Haꞌijj amsh hab e elid mam s‑gewpkdag am e‑wohochudadag ed. Mt wabshaba wo si s‑e nenꞌoidk mamt pi wo i e jushadkad k pi wo i gei am pi apꞌekam ch ed no pi wehsijj t‑aꞌappem g Jiawul.
<sax> I'm talking to sensible people, so you decide whether I'm telling the truth. ||| Am g wo i aꞌamichud ihda nam pi haꞌichu s‑aꞌamichud.
<sax> When we give thanks for the cup we use in the Lord's Supper, don't we share in the blood of Christ? When we break the communion bread, don't we share in the body of Christ? ||| Ab ach hoꞌigeꞌid g Jiosh ch ab si ihm g alidaj mach eda hab wua g mihshmda chemait hugi no pi hab d ahga mat am i dagito g e‑hon kots t ab k am iawua g e‑ehꞌed mat am t‑wehhejed muh.
<sax> By eating from one loaf of bread, we show that even though we are many, we are one body. ||| Do waꞌi hemako hegai mat am t‑wehhejed muh. Ch ahchim am t‑chehgidch mach am wehmaj d hemako am t‑wehm hab wuadch g t‑mihshmda chemait hugi.
<sax> Look at the people of Israel. Don't those who eat the sacrifices made on the altar share together? ||| Jiosh atsh am ha cheha g t‑shohshon mat wo ha kokda g haꞌichu doakam k hekaj wo iagchul g e‑chuꞌijig wehhejed k haha wo huh hegai chuhkug. K hegam mo koꞌa ab ihm g Jiosh.
<sax> What am I saying then? That anything sacrificed to idols means anything, or that an idol has any real existence? Of course not! ||| Pegih, k hegam mo ab ha wui iagchulid g e‑jijoshta ab ha ihm koꞌadch g e‑iagchulida. K eda pi d haꞌichu g ha‑jijoshta.
<sax> The pagans are sacrificing to demons, and not to God. I don't want you to have anything to do with demons! ||| Ab o wabsh ha ihm g jijawul pi e mahchch mas has e wua. Kuni pi em‑tatchuid mams wo ha wehm ab ha ihm g jijawul koꞌadch hegai mo ab ha toꞌid.
<sax> You can't drink the Lord's cup as well as the cup of demons; you can't eat from the Lord's table as well as the table of demons. ||| T‑kownalig Jesus Christ o ab t‑mahkch ihda t‑mihshmda chemait hugi. K pi shaꞌi hiwgidas mams wo ha wehmajk amai mo ab ha ihm g e‑jijoshga koꞌadch hegai mo ab ha doꞌid.
<sax> Are we trying to make the Lord jealous? Are we stronger than he is? ||| Shahag wepo mam tatchua mamt wo hehgamch g Jiosh ab ha ihmadch g jijawul mamtp hedai ha wehm koꞌa mo haschu ab wui e toꞌaw g ha‑jijoshga. S‑e g wo nenꞌoidk no pi baꞌich i s‑gewkdag g Jiosh mam ahpim ch wo s‑koꞌokam em‑namkid.
<sax> Eat whatever is sold in the market without asking questions because of your conscience, ||| Oi g am wabsh wo huhgi matp haschu am e gagda nolawtakud ch ed k pi wo e kudu mas hebai e bei. Pi o ab hu em‑ab mams ab wo ha kakke mas d hegai mo ab e toꞌid g ha‑jijoshga.
<sax> for “the earth and everything in it belong to God.” ||| An o hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed mo wehs haꞌichu d enigaj.
<sax> If a non-Christian invites you to a meal, and you feel like going, eat whatever you are served, without asking questions because of your conscience. ||| Mamtp wo tatchuad ch am wo e gegosido ha‑kih am hegam mo pi d e doꞌibiakam ch ab em‑waid. Kumt wabsh wo huh matp haschu ab wo i em‑toꞌi k pi ab hu wo ha kakke mas ab e toꞌid g ha‑jijoshga, wabsh pi wo e kudu mas hebai be k ab em‑mah.
<sax> But if someone tells you, “This food has been sacrificed to idols,” don't eat it for the sake of the one who mentioned it and for conscience' sake.  His conscience I mean, not yours. For why should my freedom be determined by someone else's conscience? ||| T wabshaba hema ab wo sha si em‑ahgi mat ab e toꞌi g ha‑jijoshga, mt pi wo huh mat heg hekaj pi wo e kudu hegai mo em‑ahgid. Pegih, mtp hems haꞌi hab wo chei, “Ms haschu ahgk hig wo ge has ni‑ahgad heg hekaj mani haschu i koꞌa mani eda heg hekaj ab hoꞌigeꞌid g Jiosh?
<sax> If I choose to eat with thankfulness, why should I be criticized for eating what I'm thankful to God for? ||| Kunis haschu ahgk wo ni‑shohbi heg wabsh hekaj mam e kudut?”
<sax> So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, make sure to do everything to the glory of God. ||| Pegih, woho o wa mach apꞌedag matt wabsh chum haschu wo koꞌad. K wabshaba ab t‑ab matt ab wo si haꞌichuch g Jiosh wabsh chum haschu k ed, chum hems heg hekaj mach haschu i koꞌad ch haschu i ihꞌe.
<sax> Don't cause offense, whether it's to Jews or Greeks or the church of God— ||| Am g wabsh s‑ap wo kihkad ch pi haꞌichu am hu hab wo junihid mas heg hekaj hedai am hab wo juh g pi apꞌekam, chum hems hegam mo pi d e doꞌibiakam.
<sax> just as I try to please everybody in all I do. I don't think of what benefits me, but what benefits others, so that they may be saved. ||| Bamt wo masmak mani ahni. Pi ani am hu waꞌi hejel ni‑chegito ch wabshaba wehs s‑ha chegito g hemajkam. Bani wa ni‑wua matp hems heg hekaj wo s‑hohhoꞌi mani has ni‑wua k ab wo s‑wohoch g haꞌichu ni‑ahga k wo e doꞌibia.
<sax> I do want you to understand that Christ is the head of every man, the man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of Christ. ||| Mt wabshaba wo chum s‑mahchk mo g cheoj am dahm g uwi. K g Christ am dahm g cheoj. K g Jiosh am wehs haꞌichu dahm.
<sax> A man's head is dishonored if he prays or prophesies with his head covered. ||| Id amt wo chehgidch mam eda e mihshmad. Mt heg hekaj ahpim chechoj pi ab hu wo ha maꞌishchid g e‑mohmi mam hekid i e hoꞌigeꞌidahun ch am ep ahg g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. Dat wo s‑ta edam haꞌichuk mamtp ab wo ha maꞌishchid.
<sax> A woman's head is dishonored if she prays or prophesies with her head uncovered—it's just as if she had her hair shaved off. ||| Kumt ahpim uꞌuwi hi ab wo ha maꞌishchid g e‑mohmi mam hekid i ha kaichudch e hoꞌigeꞌidahun ch am ep ahg g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. Bat wa masma wo s‑ta edamak mamt wo s‑wohlim hih g e‑moꞌo mamtp pi ab hu wo ha maꞌishchid.
<sax> If a woman's head is not covered, then she should have her head shaved. If it's scandalous for a woman to be shorn or shaven, then she should have her head covered. ||| Pegih, mt ab wo e maꞌishchid ch wo e mihshmad k heg hekaj pi wo si e el.
<sax> A man shouldn't cover his head, because he is the image and glory of God, while the woman is the glory of the man. ||| Kumt ahpim chechoj pi ab hu wo ha maꞌishchid g e‑mohmi e mihshmadch no pi g Jiosh am t‑eda chehgidch g e‑gewkdag. Mt wabshaba ahpim uꞌuwi ab wo e maꞌishchid nam pi ab wecho g chechoj ch ab chehgidch g ha‑gewkdag.
<sax> Man didn't come from woman, but woman came from man;  and man was not created for the woman, but the woman was created for the man. ||| Jiosh at wehpeg nahto g cheoj k heg amjed ab i wuhshad g uwi k nahto am wehhejed g cheoj.
<sax> That's why the woman should have this sign of authority on her head out of respect for the watching angels. ||| Ab o em‑neid g anghil. Kumt ahpim uꞌuwi am wo ha chehgi ab ha maꞌishch g e‑mohmi mam ab ha wecho g chechoj.
<sax> Even so, from the Lord's perspective, the woman is as essential as the man, and the man as essential as the woman. ||| K eda hab d elidaj g Jiosh mat g cheoj ch uwi ab aꞌai wo e hiwgad ch ab aꞌai wo i e wehmajk.
<sax> Doesn't nature itself indicate that a man with long hair disgraces himself? ||| S‑mahch ach mo g cheꞌechew moꞌo s‑ta edama am wehhejed g cheoj
<sax> However a woman with long hair brings herself glory, because her hair is given to her as a covering. ||| ch wabshaba am wa s‑apꞌe g uwi wehhejed no pi ab mahkch g Jiosh mat hekaj ab wo e maꞌishchid g moꞌoj.
<sax> But if anyone wants to argue about this, we don't have any other custom than this, and neither do any other of God's churches. ||| Pi ani ahpim waꞌi em‑mashcham ihda. Wehsko ani am ha mashcham mo hebai g t‑wehm wohochuddam e hehemapad. Kush wehsijj g Christ chuhchai hab masma ha mashcham. T hab pi hedai ab hu wo chum t‑neꞌowi heg hekaj.
<sax> Now in giving you the instructions that follow I can't commend you, because when you meet together you cause more harm than good! ||| Msh am haꞌichu ep pi ap hab wua mam am e hehemapad.
<sax> First of all, I hear that when you have church meetings that you are split into different factions, and I believe there's some truth to this. ||| Wehpeg ant id hab wo ah mani kah mamsh haꞌi ab e wui gegok am e nanmekch. Ni am wa heꞌes s‑wohochud ihda.
<sax> Of course such splits among you must happen so those who are genuine can prove themselves by their evidence! ||| Hemho wa at am wo i wuhsh g hab mahs kudutadag em‑shahgid mat am wo i e tashogi mo hedai pi apꞌe.
<sax> When you meet together you're not really celebrating the Lord's Supper at all. ||| Naꞌams hab elid mam s‑ap hab wua g chemait hugi hekid i e nanmekch ch amsh eda pi ap am hab junihim.
<sax> Some want to eat first before everyone else, leaving others hungry. Still others get drunk. ||| Wehpeg amsh e wehm e gegosid ch eda pi aꞌai e hoꞌid ch haꞌi wabsh s‑kokwog ch haꞌi nawkoꞌo ch haꞌi bihugkoꞌo.
<sax> After giving thanks, he broke the bread into pieces and said, “This bread is my body, which is given for you. Remember me by doing this.” ||| k am i hahai ab hoꞌigeꞌidk g Jiosh k hab kaij, “Do ni‑honshpadag ihda mamt am i em‑hahaini. Id ani hab ahgch hab kaij mant wo ni‑muhkid am em‑wehhejed. Ab g wo huhgi ihda hahainig k id chum hekid am hab wo junihid mamt hekaj wo s‑ni‑chegitok.”
<sax> In the same way he took the cup, after the meal, and said, “This cup is the new agreement sealed with my blood. Remember me when you drink it. ||| Tsh wa woho hab e juh. Kutsh am hahawa bei g tahsa k hab kaij, “Do ni‑ehꞌed ihda nawait. Id ani hab ahgch hab kaij mat g ni‑ehꞌed wo e iawua. T g Jiosh heg hekaj am hab wo juh hegai mo wa hab kaij matsh hab wo em‑juni. Ab g wo ihꞌi ihda k id chum hekid am hab wo junihid mamt wo s‑ni‑chegitok.” Neh, bo kaij g t‑kownalig Jesus.
<sax> For every time you eat this bread and drink from this cup you announce the Lord's death, until he returns.” ||| Kuch hekid am hab i wua ihda chemait hugi ch am tasho wohokamchud mat t‑wehhejed muh ch ab aihim mat ep wo jiwia.
<sax> So anyone who eats the bread or drinks from the Lord's cup in a dishonorable way will be guilty of doing wrong against the body and blood of the Lord.  Let each person examine themselves, and then let them eat the bread and drink from the cup. ||| Pegih, tt am wo si hejel i t‑mamche machs wa woho ab haꞌichuchud g t‑kownalig Jesus k am hab haha wo juh g chemait hugi. Tsh ab wo moht g chuꞌijig matp hedai pi ap hab wo wuad ihda chemait hugi no pi pi haꞌichuchud mat am dagito g e‑hon kots wui k am iawua g e‑ehꞌed mat t‑wehhejed muh.
<sax> Those who eat and drink bring judgment on themselves if they don't recognize their relationship with the body of the Lord. ||| Tt am wo ai g s‑koꞌok t‑namkidadag mattp hab wo juh g chemait hugi pi amichudch mat am t‑wehhejed muh g t‑kownalig Jesus.
<sax> That's the reason why many of you are weak and sick, and some even have died. ||| Heg am hekaj muꞌijj kokꞌo ch pi ab hu gewpk ch haꞌijj heki hu koi.
<sax> However, if we really examined ourselves, we would not be judged like this.  But when we are judged, we are being disciplined by the Lord so that we won't be condemned along with the world. ||| Bat wa masma hab wo t‑juh g Jiosh hab ahgk matt wo dagito g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig k pi gam hu hab wo i t‑juh ab amjed g Jiosh hab masma mat hegam mat pi ab hu wui wo i e nohnogi. Pi at hab masma s‑koꞌokam ab wo t‑namkid g Jiosh mattp hems wehpeg am wo si heheꞌejel i t‑mamche mach has masma.
<sax> So my brothers and sisters, when you meet together to eat the Lord's Supper, wait for each other. ||| Pegih, ni‑wepnag, am amt wo aꞌai e nenida k wehs e wehm hab wo juh g chemait hugi.
<sax> You know that when you were pagans, you were deceived, being led astray by worshiping idols who couldn't even speak. ||| Idani am hahawa s‑mahch mam wa haꞌichukaj am i e wanimed mam eda ab has ha elid mam haschu i chum jijoshchud.
<sax> Let me make it clear to you: no one who speaks in the Spirit of God says, “Curse Jesus!” and no one can say, “Jesus is Lord!” except by the Holy Spirit. ||| K wabshaba pi d Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ch am i em‑wanimed namt wa ge e nako mams wo wohokamch mo g Jesus d Jiosh. Hegam mo pi edgid g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag o hab elid mo g Jesus am gawulkdas ab Jiosh t amjed. Kuch wabshaba ahchim mach edgid s‑mahch mo g Jesus d Jiosh.
<sax> Now there are different kinds of spiritual gifts, but they come from the same Spirit. ||| Ab o t‑mahkch g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag g gewkdag matt hab wo junihid g nahnko mahs haꞌichu am wehhejed g Jiosh.
<sax> There are different kinds of ministries, but they come from the same Lord. ||| K g t‑kownalig Jesus am apꞌechudch matt has masma am hab wo junihid.
<sax> There are different ways of working, but they come from the same God, who is at work in all of them. ||| K d nahnko mahs chikpan mach am hab junihim ch wabshaba wehs ab d amjedkamaj g Jiosh.
<sax> The Spirit is given to each of us and is revealed for the good of all. ||| Heg o ab t‑mahkch g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. K id am t‑gewpkadch ch ab heheꞌejel t‑mahkch matt has wo t‑junihid ch am aꞌai wo i t‑wehmajk. Kuch s‑mahch mo am t‑eꞌeda g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag no pi ab t‑mahkch g gewkdag.
<sax> One person is given by the Spirit the ability to speak words of wisdom. Another is given a message of knowledge by the same Spirit. ||| Ab o haꞌijj t‑mahkch matt wo s‑chu aꞌamichud k am wo tashogi g s‑hasig haꞌichu ch ab haꞌijj t‑mahkch matt wo si s‑mahchk ch ahgachugad g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.
<sax> Another receives the gift of strongly trusting in God by the same Spirit. Another receives gifts of healing from that one Spirit. ||| Ab o haꞌijj t‑mahkch g geꞌe wohochudadag ch ab haꞌijj t‑mahkch matt wo ha doaj
<sax> Just like the human body is one unit but has many parts—all the parts of the body even though there are many of them, make up one body—so is Christ. ||| S‑mahch ach mo g t‑honshpadag muꞌi nahnko chuhchuꞌidag ch wabshaba d waꞌi hemako. Kuch hab wa masma wehsijj d hemako ahchim matt ab i t‑wehnad g Christ.
<sax> For it was through one Spirit that we were all baptized into one body. It doesn't matter whether we are Jews or Greeks, slave or free—we all were given the one Spirit to drink. ||| Muꞌijj am hi wa pi d Tutuligo. Tt wabshaba pi wo t‑nako machs hab wo chei mam pi d t‑wehm wohochuddam. Haꞌijj am hi wa d nenehol. K wabshaba pi has d ahga mam has i mahs ch ab i s‑wohoch g Jiosh. Heg at wehsijj ab i t‑hemakoch. K hahawa heg wa wepo mach d Jesus honshpadag. K g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag wehsijj an t‑uꞌukch.
<sax> The body is not made of one part, but many parts. ||| Kuch eda nahnko mahs haꞌichu chikpan hab masma mo g nahnko chuhchuꞌidaj g t‑honshpadag.
<sax> If the foot were to say, “Because I'm not a hand, I'm not part of the body,” would that make it not part of the body? ||| T‑tahtad o pi wepo haꞌichu hab wua mo g t‑nohnhoi. Kuch wabshaba wehs ha tatchua.
<sax> If the ear were to say, “Because I'm not an eye, I'm not part of the body,” would that make it not part of the body? ||| K g t‑nahnk gawul haꞌichu hab wua mo g t‑wuhpui.
<sax> If the whole body was an eye, how could you hear anything? If the whole body was an ear, how could you smell anything? ||| Kuch wabshaba wehs ha tatchua natt ge has masma haꞌichu wo kah mattp pi wo sha ha nahnkk ch pi has masma wo hewagi mattp pi wo sha ha dahkk.
<sax> But God has arranged each part in the body, every last one of them, placing them just as he wanted. ||| Jiosh at am nahto g oꞌodham k hab masma hab juh g nahnko chuhchuꞌidag ab t‑honshpadag ab.
<sax> If they were all the same part, what would happen to the body?  However, since there are many parts, they make up the body. ||| K wehs ab i e wehnadch g hab t‑chuhchuꞌidag no pi d hemako g t‑honshpadag.
<sax> In fact those parts of the body we do not consider to be decent to reveal we “honor” more by covering them up—what is indecent we treat with greater modesty! ||| Kuch s‑ap ha nuhkud ch ha maꞌishch mat pi wo mahsk hegam hab chuhchuꞌidag mo pi ta neidagma.
<sax> What's presentable doesn't need such covering up. God has so arranged the body that more honor is given to the parts that are less presentable. ||| Pi ach hab masma s‑ha nenꞌoid hegam hab chuhchuꞌidag mo pi has d ahga mat wo e neidad.
<sax> This is so there wouldn't be any conflict within the body—the different parts should care equally for each other. ||| Wehs ach ha tatchua g hab t‑chuhchuꞌidag mat wehs e wehm s‑ap wo chikpanad.
<sax> So when one part is suffering, all the other parts of the body suffer with it, and when one part is treated well, then all the other parts of the body are happy too! ||| Pegih, bach wa masma chum t‑wehm s‑ap chikpan ch wehs t‑wehm wo t‑shoꞌigch mattp hema haꞌichukaj wo t‑shoꞌigch. Kutt wehs t‑wehm wo s‑hehgigk mamtp hema ab wo si s‑ap has t‑ah.
<sax> Now you are the body of Christ, and each one makes up a part of it. ||| Pegih, wehsijj ach d hemako g Jesus Christ wehm ch heg wa wepo mach d honshpadaj ch heheꞌejel d nahnko chuhchuꞌidaj.
<sax> In the church, God has arranged first for some to be apostles, secondly for some to be prophets, thirdly teachers. Then there are those who perform miracles, those with healing gifts, those who can help others, those good at administration, and those who can speak different languages. ||| Jiosh at wehs ab i t‑mahkhi matt haschu hab wo junidahid.

<sax> Love does not act improperly, or insist on having its own way. Love is not argumentative and doesn't keep a record of wrongs. ||| ch pi am hu wo ha edawua ch pi wo chu daꞌad ch wo s‑bamuistk. Pi att wo kuint mat hema pi ap has wo e juh
<sax> Love takes no delight in evil but celebrates the truth. ||| k pi wo hohhoꞌi g pi apꞌekam k wabshaba si s‑ap wo t‑tahtkk ab kahkch g s‑apꞌekam
<sax> Love never gives up, keeps on trusting, stays confident, and remains patient whatever happens. ||| ch s‑ap hab wo ha elidad g hemajkam. Chum as pi ap hab wo e junihid, tt hab wo ha elidad matp hems wo wa aꞌapꞌet ch hekaj wabsh s‑ap wo nakogad matp has wo e juh.
<sax> Love never fails. Prophecies will come to an end. Tongues will become silent. Knowledge will become useless.  For our knowledge and our prophetic understanding are incomplete.  But when completeness comes, then what is incomplete disappears. ||| Ab o heheꞌejel t‑mahkch g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag g haꞌichu ahga ch pi t‑machiga neꞌoki ch haꞌichu mahchig mat d wabsh wo i t‑wehmtadagk hemuch.

<sax> Make love your most important objective! But also do your best to gain spiritual gifts, especially the ability to speak God's message. ||| Pegih, mt am wo e nakogad mamt ab wo si pikh e elidad wehs ha hekaj ch wo i ha wehmtad heg hekaj mo haschu ab t‑makiog g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag matt hab wo junihid.

<sax> Those that speak in a tongue only build themselves up, but those who speak God's message build up the church. I would like it if you all spoke in tongues, but I'd prefer if you could speak God's message. ||| Hejel o waꞌi e wehhejed hab kaij hegai mo gawul kaidam nenneok. K wabshaba hegai mo am ha ahgid mo haschu g Jiosh am i ha tashogid am i ha wehmaj g e‑wehm wohochuddam.
<sax> Those who speak for God are more important than those who speak in tongues, unless they interpret what's been said, so that the church can be built up. ||| Mamt huꞌi wehsijj wo neneokad g pi e‑machiga neꞌokikaj. Ni wabshaba baꞌich i tatchua mamt wo bei hegai mahkigdag mamt si s‑ta amichudam wo ahgad g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.

<sax> Brothers and sisters, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what benefit would I be to you unless I bring you some revelation, or knowledge, or prophetic message, or teaching? ||| Pi ant haꞌichukaj wo shaꞌi i em‑wehmt mantp hems am wo jiwia em‑wui k heg waꞌi hekaj wo neokad pi ni‑machiga neꞌoki. Bant waꞌi masma wo i em‑wehmt mant am wo tasho em‑ahgi mo haschu am ni‑maskogid g Jiosh o g haꞌichu mahchig ab amjed o g haꞌichu mashchamigaj.
<sax> Even when it comes to something non-living such as musical instruments like a flute or a harp: if they don't produce clear notes, how will you know what tune is being played? ||| Id ant wo haꞌichu wepogi mamt wo s‑amich. S‑mahch am mat pi hedai wo s‑mahchk mo haschu neꞌi am chum aꞌaga matp g uhs kuikud ch ahlpa pi kehg wo kaida.
<sax> Similarly, if the trumpet doesn't give a clear sound, who will get ready for battle? ||| T pi hedai wo s‑mahchk g shondal mat has wo e juh matp g kuhudam pi ap am hu wo kuhu g kuikud.
<sax> If I don't understand the language, those who speak make no sense to me, and I make no sense to them. ||| Mantp pi wo mahchk g neꞌokij g gawul neokdam, kutt d wabsh wo ge oꞌodhamk ab aꞌai t‑wui nach ge s‑t‑amichud.
<sax> It's the same for you—if you are keen to have spiritual gifts, try to have many of those that will build up the church. ||| S‑apꞌe o mam si tatchua g mahkigdaj g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. Kumt baꞌich am hab wo i junihid mat haschu baꞌich d wo i ha‑wehmtadagk g em‑wehm wohochuddam.
<sax> Anyone who speaks in a tongue should pray that they're able to translate what they say. ||| Hegai mat hedai wo gawul kaidam nenneokad at hemho wa wo chum e hoꞌigeꞌidahun k ab wo tai g Jiosh g amichudadag mat s‑ap wo i tashogi g gawul kaidam e‑neꞌoki.
<sax> For if I pray out loud in a tongue, my spirit is praying, but it does nothing for my understanding! ||| Pi att hedai am hu wo i ha wehmtad heg hekaj haꞌichu t‑amichudadag mattp wabsh g gawul kaidam neꞌokikaj wo t‑hoꞌigeꞌidahunad, chum achs si s‑ap t‑tahtk am heheꞌejel t‑iꞌibdag ed.
<sax> So then, what should I do? I will pray “in the Spirit,” but I will pray with my mind too. I will sing “in the Spirit,” but I will sing with my mind too. ||| Kutt heg hekaj pi wabsh wo t‑hoꞌigeꞌidahunad g gawul kaidam neꞌokikaj ch pi wabsh wo neꞌed g gawul kaidam neꞌokikaj ch wabshaba s‑ta amichudam hab ep wo t‑juh.
<sax> For if you only pray “in the Spirit,” how can ordinary people that don't have understanding say “Amen” after your prayer of thanks, since they haven't a clue what you said? ||| Pi at wo e nako hegam mo pi mahch mach has t‑wua mat t‑wehm ab wo hoꞌigeꞌel g Jiosh mattp wabsh g gawul kaidam neꞌokikaj wo t‑hoꞌigeꞌidahunad nat ge wo amich mach has kaij.
<sax> You might have said a great prayer of thanks, but the other hasn't been helped! ||| Ttp hems hi wa si s‑ap wo t‑hoꞌigeꞌidahu Jiosh wui. T wabshaba idam pi ab hu wo bei g i wehmtadag.
<sax> I thank God that I can speak in tongues more than all of you. ||| Ab o ep ni‑mahks ihda mahkigdag. Kuni ab si hoꞌigeꞌid g Jiosh mani em‑baꞌich i muꞌikko nenneok g gawul kaidam neꞌokikaj.
<sax> As Scripture records, “ ‘I will speak to my people through other languages and the lips of foreigners, but even then they won't listen to me,’ says the Lord.” ||| An o oꞌohadag mo hab kaij g Jiosh:
<sax> Speaking in tongues is a sign, not to believers, but those who don't believe. Speaking God's prophetic message is the opposite: it is not for those who don't believe, but for believers. ||| Neh, idam gawul kaidam neꞌoki mam ab si haꞌichuchud o wa d chum chehgida am ha wehhejed hegam mo pi ab hu kaimk g Jiosh ch pi t‑wehhejed d chehgida ahchim wohochuddam. Hegai mo g Jiosh am t‑tashogid matt wo ha ahgi g t‑wehm wohochuddam o am ha chehgid mo am t‑wehmaj g Jiosh, chum as pi am hu wo ha chehgi hegam mo pi kaimk g Jiosh.
<sax> If the whole church is meeting together and you are all speaking in tongues, and some people come in who don't understand, or people who don't believe, won't they say that you are insane? ||| T hegam mo s‑kaimk ch am wo i wahp t‑namki ed hab wo chei matt t‑loligoch mattp wabsh gawul kaidam wo nenneokad.
<sax> But if everyone is speaking God's message, and someone comes in who isn't a believer, or someone who doesn't understand, they will be convinced and called to account by everyone's words. ||| Hemho wa att am wo tasho ahgad mat has chu g Jiosh am wo t‑tashogi matt wo ah. Kut wo s‑t‑amich g pi e doꞌibiakam k wo s‑mai moki d pi ap chuꞌijkam ch atki wo e lodai.
<sax> The secrets of their heart will be laid bare, so they will fall to their knees and worship God, affirming that God is truly among you. ||| Wehs g haꞌichu t‑ahga at ab ha wui wo tashogi g s‑aꞌagi haꞌichu ha‑chegitoi. Kut ab wo i shul Jiosh wui k ab wo ihm k wo wohokamch moki woho am t‑wehmaj g Jiosh.
<sax> So then, brothers and sisters, what should you do? When you meet together, different people will sing, or teach, or share a special message, or speak in a tongue, or give an interpretation. But everything should be done to build up and encourage the church. ||| Id ani hab ahg, ni‑wepnag, mamt wehs haꞌichu s‑ap am hab wo junihid e‑namki ed. Mtp hems hema am wo ah g neꞌi k hema g mashchama hab wo juh k hema wo ah mat haschu g Jiosh am wo i em‑maskogi k hema hems g gawul kaidam neꞌokikaj wo neo k hema am wo i tashogi mo has d ahga ihda neꞌoki. Wehs haꞌichu at d wo i chum em‑wehmta.
<sax> If anyone wants to speak in a tongue, make it just two, or three at the most, taking turns, and someone should interpret what is said. ||| Mamtp wo neneo g gawul kaidam neꞌokikaj, mt am waꞌi waik o gohkajj hab wo juh shakal e oidam. Mt hema am wo i tashogi ihda mo am hab e kaij.
<sax> If there's no one there to interpret, those who speak in tongues should keep quiet in church and only speak to themselves, and God. ||| Kumt pi am hu hab wo chum chei g gawul kaidam neꞌoki matp pi am hu hedai wo haꞌichugk mat am wo i tashogi k wabsh hejel e wehhejed ch ab Jiosh wui hab wo chei.
<sax> You can all speak for God, one at a time, so that everyone can learn and be encouraged. ||| Wehsijj am hiwgidas mamt am wo ah g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga hehemakoj. T hab wehsijj wo haꞌichu mahch k ab hekaj wo bei g i gewkemhunadag.
<sax> It is for those who speak for God to control their prophetic inspiration, ||| Mt wo nenida g e‑apꞌedag mat hekid g Jiosh ab wo em‑mah g haꞌichu e‑ahga am ha wehhejed.
<sax> for God is not a God of disorder but of peace and quiet.  This is the way it should be in all the churches of God's people. ||| Pi o tatchua g Jiosh matt wabsh wo has hu t‑wuad ch wabshaba matt wo s‑dodolimak.
<sax> “Women should stay quiet in the churches—they shouldn't speak. They should respect their situation, as the laws states. ||| Ahpim uꞌuwi amt ab wabsh wo ha wechok. Bo masma hab chuꞌig g heki hu t‑himdag chehanig. Pi amt has wo chei ab amjed mo has i kaij g chechoj
<sax> If they want to learn they can do so at home, asking their husbands. It is not proper  for women to speak in church.” ||| k wabshaba ab wo ha kakke g e‑wehm kihkam am e‑kihki am mamtp wo haꞌichu s‑mahchim. Dat wo si edadagk mamtp ab wo ha kakke mam am e mihshmad.
<sax> What? Did the word of God begin with you? Are you the only ones it came to? ||| Pi g hab wo elidad mas ahpim em‑gahi wuhshanim ab i wuhsh g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga o mams ahpim ab waꞌi bei.
<sax> Anyone who thinks they are a prophet, or that they have some spiritual gift, should be aware that what I'm writing to you is a command of the Lord. ||| Mt wo chum s‑mahchk mo id d Jiosh chehanig mamtp hedai hab e elid mam d Jiosh haꞌichu ahgdam ch edgid g gewkdaj g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag.
<sax> Those who ignore this will themselves be ignored. ||| Kumt pi ab hu wo ha kaiha matp hedai pi ab hu wo kaiha ihda.
<sax> Now I want to remind you about the good news I announced to you. You accepted it, and you have stood firm for it. ||| Am ant ep wo em‑ahgi ihda s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh, ni‑wepnag. Ab amt i s‑wohoch mant eda am em‑ahgi heki hu k s‑wihnam gegok am e‑wohochudadag ed.
<sax> It is through this good news that you are saved if you hold on to the message that I gave you. Otherwise you trusted for nothing! ||| Do ihda s‑kehg haꞌichu ahga mamt heg hekaj wo e doꞌibia mamtp woho an uꞌukch.
<sax> I passed on to you what I myself had also received, a message of vital importance: that Christ died for our sins, according to Scripture; ||| Am ant em‑ahgi mant haschu bei. K id d si s‑has haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh ch hab chuꞌig mat g alidaj muh heg hekaj pi ap t‑chuꞌijig
<sax> he was buried and was raised from the dead on the third day, again in accordance with Scripture. ||| k uhpam ep e chegito mo am d i waik tash mamt am woi cheo ch ed hab masma mo an oꞌohadag Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana ed mat am hab wo e juh.
<sax> He appeared to Peter, then to the Twelve. ||| Am at i e chehgi Peter wui k ab hahawa wehs ha wui g am e‑chuhchai
<sax> After that he appeared to more than five hundred brothers and sisters at the same time, most of whom are still alive today, though some have died. ||| k am ep i e chehgi ha wui g hetasp siant i baꞌiwichkim mo ab d wohochuddam. Muꞌijj idam o an d wabsh kia dodakam. T haꞌijj hi wa koi.
<sax> He appeared to James, then all the apostles. ||| Am at hahawa ep i e chehgi e‑wehnag James wui k ab ep ha wui wehs g am e‑chuhchai
<sax> Last of all, he also appeared to me, someone born as it were at the wrong time.  For I'm the least important apostle of all, not even fit to be called an apostle since I persecuted God's church. ||| k am si ha oidch hab waꞌap i e chehgi ab ni‑wui. Ni eda s‑koꞌokam ha shoꞌigchud hegam mo ab s‑wohochud. K pi ab hu d chum ni‑wuikam manis d wo kehshajk. T wabshaba wa am ni‑wui i e chehgid k ab i ni‑waid k am i ni‑kei.
<sax> Now if the message declares that Christ has been raised from the dead, how is it that some of you say there's no resurrection of the dead? ||| Id o d haꞌichu t‑mashchama mat uhpam ep e chegito g Christ. Msh eda haꞌi hab chechꞌe mat pi hedai uhpam ep wo e chegito.
<sax> If there's no resurrection of the dead then Christ hasn't been raised either. ||| Pegih, t g Christ hab waꞌap pi ep e chegito matp wo wohok mat pi hedai ep wo e chegito.
<sax> And if Christ isn't raised, then our message we shared with you is pointless, and your trust in God is pointless too. ||| Kut pi d wo haꞌichuk machs hekaj wo em‑mihshmad o mams ab wo s‑wohoch.
<sax> In addition, we would be shown to be false witnesses of God when we testified that God raised Christ from the dead. But God didn't raise Christ from the dead if it's true that there's no resurrection.  If the dead are not raised, then Christ hasn't been raised either, ||| T d wabsh wo iattogik mattp wo em‑ahgi mat g Jiosh ab i wuhshad g e‑alidag.
<sax> and if Christ hasn't been raised, then your trust in God is useless, and you are still in your sins. ||| Kumt pi wo shaꞌi e doꞌibia. T pi haꞌichu wehhejed wo s‑kehgajk g em‑wohochudadag.
<sax> This also means that those who died in Christ are lost. ||| T hab waꞌap pi wo e doꞌibia hegam mat heki hu koi ab i s‑wohochudk g haꞌichu t‑ahga ab amjed g Christ.
<sax> If our hope in Christ is only for this life, we're the most pitiful people of all! ||| Shaꞌatt waꞌi si shoꞌig hab wo mahsk wehs ha baꞌiwichkim ahchim wohochuddam mattp pi uhpam ep wo t‑chegito.
<sax> But Christ <span class="it">has</span> been raised from the dead, the firstfruits  of the harvest from those who have died. ||| T wabshaba woho ab i wuhsh g Christ muhkig amjed k am i shonwuich mat wo i wuwha g koꞌi.
<sax> I die every day—let me say it bluntly, my brothers and sisters. This is just as sure as the pride I have for what Christ Jesus has done in you. ||| Neh, ni‑wepnag, wehs tashkaj o am hab chuꞌig g s‑ni‑mukimkam. Id ani hab kaij nani pi ab si has em‑elid mam d ni‑wehm wohochuddam.
<sax> Humanly speaking, what would I gain by fighting with those people in Ephesus who were like wild animals, if the dead are not raised? If the dead are not raised, “let's eat and drink, for tomorrow we die”! ||| Ia at haꞌi hab masma ni‑cheggia mo g s‑ta ehbidam haꞌichu dodakam Ephesus t am. Kunt pi ab hu ha wui wo shaꞌi kekiwua am ahgachugch matt ep wo t‑chegito am i koꞌok matp pi d wo wohokamk. Matp hab chuꞌig, nt wabsh oidk hab wo ni‑junihid g hab ha‑cheꞌi mo hab chuꞌig, “Tt hig wabsh wo si t‑gegosidad ch wo s‑hehgigk natt pi hemuch im hu hab wo i t‑juh.”
<sax> Don't be fooled: “bad company ruins good character.” ||| Mt wo e iattogid k hab waꞌap wo masmak mo hegam mamtp ab wo ha kaihamad.
<sax> Come to your senses as you should, and stop sinning! Some of you don't know God. I tell you this to shame you. ||| Haꞌijj amki pi mahch g Jiosh. K id d si em‑edadag. Am g wabsh wo dagito g pi ap e‑chegitoi k s‑ap haꞌichu wo chegito.
<sax> Of course somebody will ask, “How exactly are the dead raised? What kind of body will they have?” ||| Neh, haꞌijj amsh hab chechꞌe, “Shaht masma ep wo i wuwha g koꞌi. Kut has wo mahskad g hohon matp woho hab wo e juh?”
<sax> What a foolish question! What you sow doesn't sprout into life unless it dies. ||| Pegih, nt wo em‑tashogi. T‑hohon o wepogidas mo g haꞌichu kai. Heg at am wo e ei jewed ch ed. T g elidaj wo padt. T g kai am haha wo i wuhsh.
<sax> When you sow, you don't sow the plant it will grow into, just the bare seed, whether wheat or whatever you're planting. ||| Hegai mam am eꞌesha o d wabsh si s‑wohom haꞌichu kai ch pi d wehs hegai mat ab wo i wuhsh.
<sax> God makes the plant grow into the form he has chosen, and different seeds produce different plants with different forms. ||| Jiosh at hab masma am wo wuhshad mo has i masma tatchua k ab mahkch mat hab wo mahskad mo g jeꞌej. Wehs o gawul mahs g haꞌichu wuhshanig.
<sax> The sun shines in one way, and the moon another, while the stars are different again, with each one shining in a different way. ||| K idam mo an t‑dahm hab chuꞌig pi e wepo masma s‑kehgaj. Mashad o gawul masma s‑kehgaj mo g tash. K g huhuꞌu hab waꞌap gawul masma s‑kehgaj mo idam ch pi e wepo masma s‑kehgaj.
<sax> It's the same with the resurrection of the dead. The body is sown in decay; it is raised to last forever.  It is sown in shame; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.  It is sown as a natural body; it is raised as a spiritual body. Just as there are natural bodies there are spiritual bodies. ||| Ihda t‑honshpadag o d wabsh jewed t ab haꞌichu ch wo hekit k pi wo kehgajk ch pi wo ha gewkdagk ch wo muh k ged hu wo e hiash.

Jiosh at ab t‑mah ihda t‑honshpadag matt id dahm jewed wo hekaj. K hab mahs mat hemho wa am wo nahto g dahm kahchim honshpadag matt an wo hekajid dahm kahchim ch ed.
<sax> As Scripture says, “The first man, Adam, became a living being;”  but the last Adam a life-giving spirit. ||| Neh, bo chuꞌig g Jiosh oꞌohana mash g wehpeg oꞌodham d Adambad. Tsh id g Jiosh am nahto k ab mah g doakag k Hekaj am i shonwuich g oꞌodham doakag. K wabshaba g Christ ab hahawa t‑mahkch g wechij doakag.
<sax> The spiritual did not come first, but the natural—the spiritual came after that. ||| Pi o an hu wehpeg d dahm kahchim doakag g oꞌodham ch wabshaba hemho wa in jewed dahm wehpeg mahsi.
<sax> The first man is from the dust of the earth; the second man is from heaven. ||| Jiosh atsh wabsh g jewedkaj am nahto hegai si wehpegkam. T heg i dahm ia hahawa jiwia g Christ ab dahm kahchim t amjed.
<sax> Earthly people are like the man made from the earth; heavenly people are like the man from heaven. ||| Wehsijj ach ab d amjedkamaj hegai mat g jewedkaj e nahto ch hab wa masma. Ch ahchim mach ab s‑wohochud hegai mat ia jiwia dahm kahchim t amjed hab wa masma mo hegai.
<sax> Just as we bore the likeness of the earthly man so we shall bear the likeness of the man from heaven. ||| Matt wo i wuhsh ab muhkig amjed k haha wo wepo masmak.
<sax> However, I tell you this, my brothers and sisters: our present bodies cannot inherit the kingdom of God. These decaying bodies cannot inherit what lasts forever. ||| Pi at an hu wo shaꞌi i wah dahm kahchim ch ed ihda jewed dahm t‑hon mo aihim g muhkig.
<sax> For this perishable body must be clothed with a body that never perishes. This mortal life must be clothed with immortality. ||| Ihda t‑hon at am gawul wo e juh mat pi hekid wo muh.
<sax> When this perishable body has been clothed with a body that never perishes, and this mortal life has been clothed with immortality, then the Scripture will come true that says, “Death has been totally conquered and destroyed. ||| T hab masma wo e wohokamch ihda mo an hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed:
<sax> Death—where's your victory? Death—where's your sting?” The sting that causes death is sin; and the power of sin is the law;  but praise God who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. ||| Bo wa masma g muhkig mo g si geꞌe koꞌoi. K g s‑koꞌok t‑namkidadag heg hekaj pi ap t‑chuꞌijig heg wa wepo mo g keꞌij. T wabshaba g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ gam hu hab i juh g keꞌij ab nakogk g s‑koꞌok t‑namkidadag. Jiosh at am i apꞌech mat hab masma wo t‑gewitojel g muhkig. Kuch heg hekaj si s‑hehgigam ab hoꞌigeꞌid.
<sax> So my dear brothers and sisters: be strong, stand firm, doing everything you can for the Lord's work, since you know that nothing you do in the Lord is wasted. ||| Pegih neh, ni‑wepnag, pi at wo shaꞌi heki e wua matt haschu am hab wo junihid g t‑kownalig Jesus wehhejed. Kumt heg hekaj s‑wihnam wo gegokkad e‑wohochudadag ed ch chum hekid wo si chikpanad wehhejed.
<sax> Now about “collecting money for fellow-believers.” I'm giving you the same instructions for you to follow as I did to the churches in Galatia. ||| Id ant hab wo ah heg amjed lial mamt am wo toꞌawad ha wehhejed hegam e‑wehm wohochuddam mo am kih Judea jewed ch ed. Bani ha ahg hegam wohochuddam mo am muꞌikpa kih Galasia jewed ch ed mat am wo toꞌawad g e‑lialiga.
<sax> On the first day of the week everybody should set aside some money you've earned. I don't want there to be any collections to have to be made when I'm with you. ||| Kumt ahpim hab wa masma hab waꞌap am wo haꞌi toꞌawad wehs domig ed mamtp heꞌekia wo i e nako am aꞌamichudk mam heꞌekia i ha gew.
<sax> When I get there I will write recommendation letters for whoever you choose, and they will take your donation to Jerusalem. ||| Kumt am wo haꞌi i ha chuhcha mat am wo i ui g em‑mahkigdag Jerusalem wui. Nt am wo ha oꞌohani g geꞌegedchu Jerusalem t am am jiwiak em‑wui. T id am wo i bei g em‑chuhchai k am wo hihi.
<sax> If it works out for me to go too, they can come with me. ||| Kunt ahni am epai wo ha oi matp d wo Jiosh tatchuik mant am wo hih.
<sax> This time I don't want to come and see you for just a short time. I hope I can stay for a while with you, if that's what the Lord permits. ||| Pi ant wo em‑nei am himadch Macedonia wui nani pi tatchua mant am wo wa tash em‑wehmajkahim matp d wo Jiosh tatchuik.
<sax> However I will stay on at Ephesus until Pentecost, ||| Bani ni‑elid mant ia wo haꞌichugk Ephesus kihhim t am ch ab wo ai g bahijida gegosig.
<sax> because a tremendous door of opportunity has opened up for me there, though there are plenty who oppose me. ||| Geꞌej o g ni‑apꞌedag mant am hab wo junihid g Jiosh chikpan iia, chum as hi wa muꞌijj ab ni‑wui gegok.
<sax> Now if Timothy arrives, make sure that he has nothing to fear by being with you, for he's working for the Lord just as I am. ||| Tp hems am wo jiwia g Timothy em‑shahgid. Kumt si s‑ap ab wo neidad no pi am hab waꞌap junihim g Jiosh chikpan hab masma mani ahni.
<sax> Don't let anyone look down on him. Cheerfully send him on his way so he can come and see me—the brothers and sisters and I are waiting for him. ||| Pi amt wo pi ap hab elidad mo d wabsh wechij oꞌodham ch wabshaba am wo i wehmt.

<sax> As for our brother Apollos: I urged him to go and see you together with the other believers, but he wasn't willing to go at the moment. He'll come and visit when he gets the chance. ||| Am amsh s‑neidamk g Apollos. Kuni ab chum si i gewkemhun mat am wo i em‑chehgim.

Aquila and Priscilla, along with the church that meets in their home, send their best wishes. ||| Hegam mo ab ihm g Christ iia Asia jewed ch ed o am i em‑ahgid mamt ab wo i s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌel.

<sax> I Paul write this greeting with my own hand. ||| Ia ant hejel wo oꞌoha g ni‑hoꞌigeꞌidadag am em‑wui.
<sax> Anyone who doesn't love the Lord should be excluded from the church. Come Lord! ||| Jiosh at gam hu hab wo i ha juh matp hedai pi ab hu wo tatchuad g t‑kownalig Jesus. Ia at ep wo jiwia g Jesus s‑hohtam.
<sax> May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. ||| Si o s‑hemajima g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ ab em‑wui ch baꞌich ab wo i em‑mah g i wehmtadag.
<sax> My love to all of you in Christ Jesus. Amen. ||| Ab ani si pihk ni‑elid wehs em‑hekaj ahpim ni‑wehm wohochuddam.
<sax> This is the message we received from him and that we declare to you: God is light, and there is absolutely no darkness in him at all. ||| Jesus o am t-ahgid mash g Jiosh d hekia tonlig.
<sax> If we claim to share this friendship with him and yet go on living in darkness, we're lying, and not living in the truth. ||| T wo ha iattogi matp hedai hab wo chei mo s-mahch g Jiosh k eda hab wo junihid g pi apꞌekam. Id o am s-chuhugam k ed him.
<sax> But if we are living in the light, as he is in the light, then we share in this friendship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, makes us clean from every sin. ||| Jiosh o d wohokam.

<sax> If we claim we haven't sinned, we turn him into a liar, and his word is not in us. ||| Jiosh o am t-tashogid matt wehsijj hab juh g pi apꞌekam. Kut hedai hab wo chei mo pi ha chuꞌijig k am wo e chehgi mo pi ab hu wohochud g Jiosh.
<sax> My dear children, I'm writing this to you so you shouldn't sin. But if anybody should happen to sin, we have someone who defends us before the Father—Jesus Christ, who is truly right. ||| Dam ni-aꞌaliga ab i s-wohochudk g haꞌichu ni-ahga.

<sax> But those who follow God's word have his love totally fill their hearts. This is how we know that we live in him. ||| Ahchim mach hab wua g Jiosh tatchui ach wohoꞌi ab si tatchua. Id at am wo t-chehgi mach woho d aꞌaligaj.
<sax> Whoever claims to be living in him should behave like Jesus. ||| Jiosh alidag o chum hekid am hab junihim g e-ohg tatchui. Kutt ahchim hab wo chum masmak mattp woho d aꞌaligaj g Jiosh.
<sax> My friends, I'm not writing to you giving some new commandment, but an old commandment you've had from the beginning. This old commandment is one you have already heard. ||| Pegih, ni-tatchui, pi ani em-ahgid g wechij chehanig am em-ahgidch mamt ab aꞌai wo si e tatchuad. Jiosh o wa heki hu hab masma t-chehani. Kum id ab kaichug heki hu waꞌi amjed.
<sax> But in a sense I am giving you a new commandment. Its truth is revealed in Jesus and in you, for the darkness is coming to an end and the true light is already shining. ||| T eda g Jiosh alidag am i wechijid t-wehhejed mat ab i t-mah g wechij doakag. Tonlig o gam hu hab i wua g s-chuhugam am t-wehhejed.
<sax> Those who say they live in the light but hate a fellow Christian  still have the darkness inside them. ||| Am o wabsh kia him s-chuhugam k ed matp hedai s-kehꞌid g e-wehnag, chum as hab wo kaijjid mo hab wua g s-apꞌekam.
<sax> Those who love their fellow Christians live in the light, and don't cause others to sin. ||| Tt am tonlig ch ed wo hihimad mattp woho ab wo si ha tatchuad g t-wepnag. T pi hedai wo pihk chuꞌi heg hekaj mach has masma.
<sax> Those who hate a fellow Christian are in darkness. They stumble around in the dark, not knowing where they're going because the darkness has blinded them. ||| K wabshaba am s-chuhugam k ed him hegai matp hedai wo s-ha kehꞌidad.
<sax> Dear friends, I'm writing to you children, for your sins have been forgiven through the name of Jesus. ||| Pi ant hab ahgk am wo em-oꞌohani mams pi mahch g Jiosh. Gm at hu hab i juh g em-chuꞌijig. Kum s-mahch.
<sax> For all the things of this world—our sinful desires, wanting everything we see, boasting about what we've accomplished in life— these things don't come from the Father but from the world. ||| Pi o d shaꞌi Jiosh hab elida matt hab wo s-junim g pi apꞌekam o si s-wohom wo s-behim mach haschu i neid o machs haschukaj wo si t-haschudad.

<sax> Dear friends, this is the last hour. As you've heard, the antichrist is coming. Many antichrists have already come. This is how we know this is the last hour. ||| Am am wa kah matsh an wo i e maskogi hegai mash d si obgaj g Jiosh alidag. Heki at hu muꞌi an i wuwha t-shahgid mo d obgaj.

<sax> They left us, but they didn't belong with us, for if they did, they would have remained with us. When they left they showed that none of them belonged with us. ||| T wo chum t-wehm wih matp d t-wehm wohochuddam k wabshaba am i t-dagito. K heg hekaj tasho mo pi woho d t-wehm wohochuddam.
<sax> But you have been anointed  with the Holy Spirit's blessing, and all of you know what's true. ||| Jiosh alidag at ab t-mah g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag. K heg am t-wehmaj ch i t-wehmt. Kuch heg hekaj s-mahch g wohokam.
<sax> I'm not writing because you don't know the truth, but because you do know it, and because no lie comes from the truth. ||| Pi o hekid g iattogi d wohokam. Kum s-mahch ihda nam pi s-mahch g wohokam. Nt heg hekaj am em-oꞌohani ihda.
<sax> Who is the liar?—anyone who denies that Jesus is the Christ. The antichrist is anyone who denies the Father and the Son. ||| Hegam mo hab kaij mo g Jesus pi d Jiosh alidag o wehs ha baꞌich d i s-chu iꞌattomkam ch d obgaj. Heg o hekaj e chehgid mo pi ab hu wohochud g Jiosh.
<sax> Anyone that denies the Son does not have the Father; anyone who acknowledges the Son has the Father too. ||| Hegam mo pi ab hu ihm g Jiosh alidag o hab waꞌap pi ab hu ihm g Jiosh. Hegam o ab waꞌi ihm g Jiosh mo hedai ab ihm g alidaj.
<sax> I'm writing this to warn you against those who want to lead you astray. ||| Am ant em-oꞌohani ab ha amjed hegam mo em-iattogid ch im hu hab i s-em-junimk ab amjed g Jesus. Kumt pi ab hu haꞌichu wo mahchim ha ab.
<sax> But the anointing you received from him means the Spirit lives in you, and you don't need to be taught by anyone. The Spirit's anointing teaches you about everything. It is the truth and not a lie. So live in Christ, just as you've been taught! ||| Pi o hab chum mahs mams wabsh chum hasko amjed wo i e gahgidahi mam haschu i pi amichud. Jiosh alidag at ab em-mah g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag. Kut heg chum hekid am wo em-wehmajk ch wehs wo em-mashchamad g wohokam. Kumt ab wo kaihamad g mashchamaj ch ab wo s-wohog elidad g Jiosh alidag
<sax> Now, my dear friends, continue to live in Christ, so that when he appears, we can be confident and not feel ashamed before him at his coming. ||| ch hab masma pi wo si e el mat hekid ep wo jiwia.
<sax> If you know he is good and right, then you also know that everyone who does what is right has been born of God. ||| Do hekia s-apꞌekam g Jiosh. Kumt heg hekaj wo s-mahchk mamtp hedai hab junihim g s-apꞌekam ch d aꞌaligaj.
<sax> Look at the amazing kind of love the Father has for us! This is why we can be called God's children—for that's who we are! The reason why the people of this world don't recognize us as God's children is because they don't recognize him. ||| Jiosh at hab t-juh mach d hahawa aꞌaligaj no pi si pihk e elid ab t-wui. Hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh alidag o pi mahch mach ahchim hab waꞌap d Jiosh aꞌaliga.
<sax> My friends, we are already God's children; however what we shall become hasn't been revealed just yet. But we do know that when he appears, we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he really is. ||| Batt wo chum masmak mo g Jiosh alidag nach pi hab waꞌap d aꞌaligaj.

<sax> All those who sin are lawless, because sin is lawlessness. ||| Dat wo pi ap chuꞌijkamk am Jiosh chehanig ed hegai mat hedai hab wo junihid g pi apꞌekam.
<sax> Dear friends, don't let anyone fool you: those who do what is right <span class="it">are</span> right, in the same way as Jesus is right. ||| Haꞌi o hab kaij mamt d wo s-apꞌekamk, chum hems pi am hu hab junihidch g s-apꞌekam.

<sax> The message you've heard from the beginning is simply this: we should love one another. ||| Ihda mani em-ahgid o d hegai mam kaichug ged hu i amjed mamt wehpeg kah. Ab g wo si pihk e elidad aꞌai e wui.
<sax> We cannot be like Cain, who belonged to the Evil One, and murdered his brother. Why did he murder him? Because Cain did what was evil, while his brother did what was right. ||| Neh, hema ash wa d Cain ch hab junihim g Jiawul tatchui. Kumt pi oidk am hab wo e junihid. Cain cheoj wehnag ash wa hab junihim g s-apꞌekam. Sh g Jiosh si tatchua. Tsh g Cain heg hekaj s-hehgam k mua.
<sax> So don't be surprised, my friends, if this world hates you! ||| Pi g wo shaꞌi e totodsid mat hems g hemajkam hab wa masma wo s-em-kehꞌidad.
<sax> The reason we know that we have changed from death to life is because we love our Christian brothers and sisters. Anyone who doesn't love remains dead. ||| S-mahch ach mo ab t-mahkch g Jiosh g wechij doakag nach pi si pihk t-elid ha hekaj g t-wehm wohochuddam ch hab masma ab ha neid mo d t-wepnag. Hegam mo pi pihk e elid ha hekaj g e-wepnag o hab sha masma mo g koꞌi.
<sax> All those who hate their Christian brothers and sisters are murderers, and you know that no murderers have eternal life within them! ||| Heg o wa wepo mo d ha muꞌakam matp hedai s-ha kehꞌid. Kuch s-mahch mo pi edgid g wechij doakag hegam mat hedai d wo ha muꞌakamk.
<sax> This is how we know what love is: Jesus laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for our Christian brothers and sisters. ||| Jiosh alidag at ab muh kots t ab t-wehhejed no pi t-hekaj si pihk e elid. Id o hekaj tasho mo haschu d pihk elidadag. Kutt wo si pihk t-elidad ha hekaj g t-wepnag am hugkam matt chum hems wo t-muhkid am ha wehhejed.
<sax> If one of you is living well in this world and you see your Christian brother or sister in need, but you don't show compassion—how can God's love be living in you? ||| Pi o shaꞌi pihk e elid ab Jiosh wui hegai mat hedai haꞌichu wo s-edgidad ch pi heg hekaj ab hu wo i wehmt g e-wehnag.
<sax> whenever we think we're in the wrong. God is greater than how we think, and he knows everything. ||| Hebaichujj ach ab haꞌichu t-chuꞌijigchud. K wabshaba g Jiosh baꞌich i s-gewkdag mach ahchim ch wehs haꞌichu s-mahch
<sax> Dear friends, if we're reassured we're not in the wrong, we can have confidence before God. ||| ch gam hu hab i juh hegai t-chuꞌijig. Tt hab pi haꞌichu ab hu wo t-chuꞌijigchud k ab wabsh wo i miabi g Jiosh pi shaꞌi has t-elidch.
<sax> We'll receive from him whatever we ask him for, because we follow his commands and do what pleases him. ||| Bach junihim g Jiosh tatchui ch hegai mo haschu ab t-chehani. K g Jiosh heg hekaj am hab t-junid mach haschu ab i tahni.
<sax> This is what he commands: we should trust in the name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as he commanded us to do. ||| K id d chehanigaj g Jiosh matt ab wo s-wohochudad g alidaj ch ab aꞌai t-wui wo si pihk t-elidad mo hab masma t-chehani g alidaj.
<sax> Those who keep his commands continue to live in him, and he lives in them. We know that he lives in us by the Spirit he has given us. ||| Mach hedai ab s-wohog elid g Jiosh att ab si t-hemakoj heg wehm. Jiosh at ab t-mah g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag. K id d Jiosh ch t-wehmaj. Kuch heg hekaj s-mahch mach d aꞌaligaj.
<sax> Dear friends, don't trust every spirit, but put the spirits to the test to find out whether they're from God, for there are many false prophets out there in the world. ||| Muꞌi at an i wuwhag k hab chum e wua mo d ha mihshmaddam.

<sax> How can you recognize God's Spirit? Every spirit that accepts Jesus Christ came with a human body is from God; ||| Ahchim o waꞌi t-wehmaj g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag mach hedai wohokamchud mo g Jesus d Jiosh alidag ch ia mahsi k d oꞌodham hab masma mach ahchim.
<sax> while every spirit that doesn't accept Jesus, that spirit isn't from God. In fact it is the spirit of the antichrist which you heard was coming, and which is already in the world. ||| Pi o am hu ha wehmaj g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag hegam mo hedai pi ab hu wohochud g Jiosh alidag. Am o hema ha wehmaj ch d Jesus obga. Heki am hu kah mat an wo i wuhsh g obgaj. K hemuch in haꞌichug no pi an ha wehmaj hegam mo pi ab hu wohochud g Jiosh alidag.
<sax> We belong to God and whoever knows God listens to us, while whoever doesn't belong to God doesn't listen to us. This is how we can distinguish the spirit of truth from the spirit of deception. ||| Pi o ab hu t-kaiham mach chum neneok ab amjed g Jiosh no pi pi mahch g Jiosh. Hegam o ab waꞌi t-kaiham mo hedai s-mahch g Jiosh. Bach masma s-mahch mo hedai edgid g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag. Heg o am ha tashogid g wohokam.
<sax> Dear friends, let's go on loving one another, for love comes from God. All those who love are born of God and know God. ||| Ab att wo chum si pihk t-elidad aꞌai t-wui no pi g Jiosh ab t-mahkch g pihk elidadag. Mamtp woho wo s-mahchk g Jiosh ch d aꞌaligaj ch wo si pihk e elidad.
<sax> Those who don't love don't know God, for God is love. ||| Jiosh o si t-tatchua ch heg hekaj si pihk e elid ab t-wui. K hegam mo pi edgid g pihk elidadag pi d shaꞌi aꞌaligaj.
<sax> How was God's love shown to us? God sent his one and only Son into the world so that we could live through him.  This is love! It's not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and he sent his Son to be the reconciliation for our sins. ||| Jiosh at ab i wuhshad g si hemako e alidag id dahm jewed. T heg ab nako g s-koꞌok t-namkidadag mach heg ab beihog. Kut hab masma ab t-mah g wechij doakag. Bat wa masma am t-tashogi g Jiosh mo si pihk e elid ab t-wui. Kutt heg amjed i s-mai g pihk elidadag k hahawa si pihk t-elid ab Jiosh wui.
<sax> Friends, if this is the way God loves us, we ought to love one another like this too. ||| Am o wa tasho mo ab t-wui si pihk e elid g Jiosh. Pegih, ni-wepnag, ahchim att hab waꞌap wo chum si pihk t-elidad ab aꞌai t-wui.
<sax> No one has ever seen God. However, if we love one another then God lives in us, and his love is fulfilled in us. ||| Pi ach hedai hekid shaꞌi neid g Jiosh g t-wuhpuikaj. K wabshaba heg ab t-mahkch g si geꞌe pihk elidadag. Kuch heg hekaj s-mahch mo t-wehmaj.
<sax> How can we know that we live in him, and that he lives in us? He's given us the ability to love by his Spirit. ||| Jiosh at ab t-mah g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag. K heg d Jiosh ch ab t-wehm kihdag. Kuch heg hekaj s-mahch mach d aꞌaligaj.
<sax> For we are witnesses to what we have seen and testify that the Father sent the Son as the Savior of the world. ||| Heki at hu am i kei g Jiosh g e-alidag mat ab wo i hih jewed wui k wo ha doꞌibia g hemajkam. Kuni si neid ihda ch heg amjed am em-ahgid.
<sax> This is how love is made complete in us so that we can be confident on judgment day: by the fact that we live just like him in this world. ||| Ab o t-mahkch g si geꞌe pihk elidadag. Kuch wepo masma ab si tatchua mo g alidaj ch hab s-ap t-taht k wo ai g lodaita
<sax> Where there is love there can be no fear. God loves us completely, and this love drives all our fears away. If we do fear, it's because we fear being punished, and this shows that we have not been fully re-made by the completeness of God's love. ||| k pi wo ehbidad. Gm at hu hab i juh g pi ap t-namkidadag g Jiosh no pi si pihk e elid ab t-wui. Kutt heg hekaj pi wo ehbidad ch wabsh aigo wo si pihk t-elidad ab wui. Pi o pihk e elid ab Jiosh wui hegai mat hedai wo s-ehbidad.
<sax> We love because he loved us first. ||| Wehpeg o si pihk e elid g Jiosh ab t-wui. Kuch heg hekaj edgid g pihk elidadag.
<sax> Anyone who says, “I love God,” but hates a Christian brother or sister, is a liar. Anyone who doesn't love a brother whom they can see, can't love God whom they can't see. ||| Pi o woho d Jiosh wohochuddam mo hedai pi ab hu pihk e elid t-wui ahchim mach d wohochuddam. Baꞌich o i s-hasig matt ab wo si tatchua hegai mach pi neid. Pi at wo e nako mat ab wo si tatchua g Jiosh matp hedai pi ab hu wo si ha tatchua g e-wepnag.
<sax> This is the command he gave to us: those who love God love their brothers and sisters too. ||| Ab o t-chehani g Jiosh ahchim mach ab si tatchua matt ab epai wo si ha tatchuad g t-wepnag.
<sax> Whoever trusts that Jesus is the Christ is born of God, and whoever loves the father also loves his child. ||| Dach Jiosh aꞌaliga wehsijj ahchim mach s-wohochud mo g Jesus d alidaj g Jiosh ch d si Kehshaj. Kutt ab aꞌai wo si t-tatchuad nach pi d t-wepngam. K g Jiosh d t-ohg.
<sax> How do we know that we love God's children? When we love God and follow his commands. ||| S-mahch ach mo d wohokam g t-tatchuidag ab aꞌai t-wui nach pi ab si tatchua g Jiosh.
<sax> Loving God means that we follow his commands, and his commands are not hard to bear. ||| K am wa tasho mach ab si tatchua g Jiosh nach pi ab s-wohog elid. K g chehanigaj pi shaꞌi wehch am t-wehhejed.
<sax> So there are three that give evidence:  the Spirit, the water, and the blood, and all three agree as one. ||| T g pahl wakonaj ch muhkigaj am wohokamch mo d Jiosh alidag ch d doakam id dahm jewed. K g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag hab waꞌap wohokamchud. Idam waik o am wohokamchud mo g Jesus d Jiosh alidag.
<sax> If we accept the evidence that human witnesses provide, then the evidence that God provides is much more important. The evidence that God provides is his testimony about his Son. ||| Neh, ab ach s-wohochud g oꞌodham mat ab haꞌijj wo t-ahgi mo si s-ap s-mahch. K g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga baꞌich i s-gewkdag mat heg am wohokamch g e-alidag.
<sax> Those trusting in the Son of God have accepted and hold on to this evidence. Those who don't trust God make God out to be a liar, because they don't believe the evidence God has given about his Son. ||| Kutt hedai ab wo s-wohoch g Jiosh alidag k wo si s-ap s-mahchk mo d wohokam. Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag at t-wehhejed wo wohokamch. Hegam mo pi wohochud g Jiosh oki hab elid mo t-iattogid.
<sax> The evidence is this: God has given eternal life to us, and we have this life through his Son. ||| Ab o i t-tashogid g Jiosh mo ab t-makiog g pi ha huhugedam doakag am gahi wuhshanim g e-alidag.
<sax> Whoever has the Son has life; whoever doesn't have the Son of God doesn't have life. ||| Ahchim mach ab ihm g alidaj ach edgid hegai doakag. K hegam mo pi ab hu ihm pi edgid.
<sax> I'm writing to tell those of you who trust in the name of the Son of God so you can be certain you have eternal life. ||| Id ant am em-oꞌohani ahpim mam ab ihm g Jiosh alidag mamt hekaj wo s-mahchk mam edgid ihda wechij doakag.
<sax> We can be confident that he will listen to us as long as we ask in accordance with his will.  If we know that he hears our requests, we can be sure that we will receive what we've asked him for. ||| Si ach s-mahch mat ab wo t-kaiha g Jiosh matt ab haꞌichu wo tai matp id am tatchuij oidch d wo haꞌichuk. Kutt heg hekaj ab wo i t-gewkemhunad ch ab wo haꞌichu tahnid nat pi woho am hab wo t-junidahid.
<sax> If you see your Christian brother or sister committing a sin that is not a deadly sin, you ought to pray and God will grant life to the one who's sinned. (But not for a deadly sin. There's a sin that is deadly, and I'm not saying people should pray about that. ||| Ab att wo tahnid g Jiosh mat gam hu hab wo i juh g ha-chuꞌijig g t-wehm wohochuddam matp ab wo e shohbi. Kut hab wo juh mach haschu ab tahni. Pi ani em-ahgid mams wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahu ha wehhejed hegam mat pi ab hu wo shaꞌi e shohbi.
<sax> We also know that the Son of God has come, and has helped us to understand so we can recognize the one who is true. We live in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God, and is eternal life. ||| K g Jiosh alidag ab t-mahkch g amichudadag matt wo s-mahchk g wohokam Jiosh ch wo edgidad g wechij doakag.

<sax> Dear friends, stay away from idol worship. ||| Kumt pi haꞌichu ep wo jioshchud k pi hedai ep ab hu wui wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahunad.
<sax> You were chosen by God the Father in his wisdom, made holy by the Spirit, so that you might obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood. May you have grace and peace more and more! ||| Jiosh at ab i em-gawulkai mamt d wo hemajkamgajk k ab em-mah g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag mat wo em-wehmajk ch am wo i kegch g em-dodakag.

<sax> Praise God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! Through his great mercy we have been born again and given a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. ||| Ab att hig wo si i hoꞌigeꞌel g Jiosh heg hekaj t-kownalig Jesus Christ.

<sax> This inheritance is eternal, it never spoils or fades, and it is kept safe in heaven for you. ||| Jiosh o an nahtokch g si s-kehg kihdag am t-wehhejed an dahm kahchim ch ed. T ihda apꞌechudaj chum hekid d wo hekiakamk ch pi hekid wo e padch.
<sax> Through your trust in him, God will protect you by his power until salvation arrives—the salvation that is ready to be revealed at the last day. ||| Ab ach s-wohochud g Jesus Christ.

<sax> These prove that your trust in God is genuine, just as fire is used to prove if gold is genuine—even though that too can be destroyed—and your faith is more valuable than gold! In this way your trust in God will be recognized and you will receive praise, glory, and honor when Jesus Christ appears. ||| Ihda em-shoꞌigchudadag at wo aꞌappe g em-wohochudadag k wo chehgi mo d wohokam hab masma mat g ohla g meikaj wo e aꞌappe mas d wohokam.

<sax> It was explained to them that they were not doing this for themselves, but for you—since what they spoke about you've now learned from those who shared the good news with you by the Holy Spirit that heaven sent. Even the angels are eager to find out about all this! ||| S-mahch ash mat pi wabsh hejel e wehhejed oꞌoha hegai mash am ha wui i e tashogid.

<sax> In complete contrast, you are a specially-chosen family, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people belonging to God. Consequently you can reveal the wonderful things he's done, calling you out of darkness into his marvelous light. ||| Kum eda ahpim ab s‑wohochud ch d Jiosh hemajkamga ch wehs d papal am wehhejed g t‑kownalig Jesus.

<sax> However there's no credit when you're punished for doing something wrong. But if you suffer for doing what is right, and you put up with it, then God's grace is with you. ||| Ab o d t‑wuikam g s‑koꞌok namkidadag mattp hab wo junihid g pi apꞌekam.

<sax> In fact this is what you were called to do, because Christ suffered for you and gave you an example, so you should follow in his footsteps. ||| no pi hab d elidaj matt s‑ap ab wo nako.
<sax> and when he was badly treated, he didn't retaliate. When he suffered, he didn't threaten to take revenge. He simply placed himself in the hands of the one who always judges rightly. ||| Ab amt wa si s‑koꞌokam has ah. T wabshaba pi ab hu aigo has ha ah. Si amt shoꞌigch. T wabshaba pi ha ebkiod k ab wabsh i e dagitokch Jiosh wui s‑mahchch mo heg d si s‑apꞌekam usagakam.

<sax> Wives, accept your husbands' authority in the same way, so that if some husbands refuse to accept the word, they may still be won over without words by the way you behave, ||| Ahpim uꞌuwi amt ab wo e dagitokch heheꞌejel e‑kuhkun ha wui k ch s‑ap wo ha nuhkudad chum hems hegam mo pi ab hu wohochud g Jiosh.

<sax> Husbands, in just the same way, be considerate to your wives as you live together with them. Though she may not be as strong as you are, you should honor her since she will inherit equally with you God's gift of life. Make sure to do this so nothing will get in the way of your prayers. ||| Ahpim chechoj amt ab wo has ha elidad g e‑hohonig nam pi s‑mahch mo pi am hu hugkam s‑gewkdag mam ahpim.

<sax> Don't pay back evil for evil, or retaliate when you're abused, instead you should give a blessing—because that's what you were called to do, so you could gain a blessing yourself. ||| Pi g am wo e agwua g pi apꞌekamkaj k pi ab hu wo i nodagi g pi kehg neꞌoki.

<sax> just keep your mind focused on Christ as Lord. Always be ready to explain to anyone who asks you the reason for the hope that you have. Do this in a gentle and respectful way. ||| Ab g wo has elidad g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ ch chum hekid wo e nahtokchid mamt s‑ap wo ahgi mat hedai ab wo i em‑kakke mam haschu wui ab e gewpkadch.
<sax> Make sure your conscience is clear, so that if anyone makes accusations against you, they will be embarrassed for speaking badly about the good way you live your life in Christ. ||| Kumt wabsh si s‑ap e taht k wabsh s‑hemajim ab wo ha ahgi.
<sax> He went to speak to those “imprisoned” ||| Id gahi wuhshanim Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag o wa g Jesus Christ am ha mihshmad hegam mo hemu d koꞌi ch gam hu si kuhpi.
<sax> that refused to believe, when God patiently waited in the time of Noah while the ark was being built. Only a few—in fact eight people—were saved “through water.” ||| Jiosh ash wa si s‑hemajim ab ha nenida g hemajkam mash eda g Noahbad ab s‑wohog elid ch nahtohim g geꞌe wahlko.

<sax> This water symbolizes baptism that now saves you, not by washing off dirt from your body, but as a positive response to God that comes from a clear conscience. It is the resurrection of Jesus Christ that makes your salvation possible. ||| Id ani wepogid g t‑pahl wakonadag.

<sax> Since Christ suffered physically, you must prepare yourselves with the same attitude he had—for those who suffer physically have turned away from sin. ||| E at shoꞌigch g Christ k hekaj am gewito g pi apꞌekam t‑wehhejed. Kumt id wo s‑chegitok namt pi hab waꞌap wo e shoꞌigch mamt wo gewito g pi apꞌekam.

<sax> People think it's strange that you don't join them anymore in this wild and excessive lifestyle, so they curse at you. But they will have to explain what they've done to the One who is ready to judge the living and the dead. ||| Hemu at e ai mamt haꞌasa hab juh hegai hab mahs pi apꞌekam.

<sax> Anyone who speaks should do so as though God is speaking through them. Anyone who wants to help others should do so through the strength that God gives, so that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. May glory and power be his forever and ever. Amen. ||| Mamtp hedai wo ha mihshmad k heg waꞌi Jiosh haꞌichu ahga wo ahgad. Mtp hedai ab wo mahksk mamt wo i ha wehmtad g hemajkam, mt am hab wo juh heg hekaj gewkdag mo g Jiosh ab em‑mahkch.

Don't be arrogant, lording it over those who have been put in your care, but be an example to the flock. ||| Am o haꞌi em‑nuhkudachud g Jiosh g hemajkam.

He's the one who judges our motives. ||| Jiosh at t-aꞌappem k am i t-chuhcha matt wo i ahgahi g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj.

<sax> Don't you remember, brothers and sisters, all our hard work— working day and night so we wouldn't be a burden to any of you as we shared God's good news with you? ||| Am amtp hu waꞌi s-chegito mach si chikpan wabsh i siꞌalim amjed ch mehk s-chuhugam k ed matt pi haꞌichukaj wo em-kudu.
<sax> You yourselves can testify as to how we acted, and God can too—how we treated you believers with a holy attitude, fairly and blamelessly. ||| Si ach wa s-ap ab em-neid ch pi hekid hab wua g pi apꞌekam ab hema i em-wui. Jiosh o s-mahch ihda. Kum ahpim hab waꞌap s-mahch.
<sax> You know how we cared for every one of you like a father caring for his own children. We encouraged you, comforted you, and shared with you our experience  so that you could live as God would want you to live—the God who calls you to his own kingdom and glory. ||| Jiosh o ab i em-waid mamt am wo apꞌedagk kihdaj ed ch ab wehmaj wo uꞌukchid g ab has elidadag. Kum s-mahch mach am i em-gewkemhun wepo masma mo g ha-ohg ch ab s-ap i em-neneokid ch i em-chehani mamt am hab wo masmak mam d Jiosh aꞌaliga.
<sax> Another thing: we're always thanking God that when you heard and accepted the word of God, you didn't treat it as some human words, but what it truly is, the word of God. This is what is at work in those of you who trust in him. ||| Heg ach waꞌi ahgachug Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch pi g hemajkam haꞌichu ha-ahga. Kumt hab waꞌi masma hab elid k hekaj ab i s-wohoch. Jiosh o am i chikpan em-shahgid ch am wohokamchud mo d haꞌichu ahgaj. Kuch hekaj chum hekid ab si hoꞌigeꞌelid.
<sax> The experience you brothers and sisters have had imitates that of God's churches that belong to Christ Jesus in Judaea. Just like your fellow Jewish Christians you suffered as they did at the hands of the Jewish leaders ||| Am am ha oidch hab e wua hegam e-wehm wohochuddam mo am aꞌai kih Judea ch ed. Ha-wehm oꞌodham o ha shoꞌigchud. K hegam wabsh s-ap ab nakog. Kum ahpim hab waꞌap wabsh s-ap ab nakog mo g em-wehm oꞌodham em-shoꞌigchud.
<sax> who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and chased us out. They don't please God and they are hostile to everyone, ||| Do hegam ni-wehm oꞌodham mat wa mua g t-kownalig Jesus. Kush d t-shohshon mat wa ha kokda g Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam. K hegam ni-wehm oꞌodham t-shoꞌigchud ch gm hu i t-wuwhas ahchim mach am ahgachug g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh.

<sax> trying to prevent us from speaking to the other nations to prevent them from being saved. They're always sinning to the maximum extent, but for them full judgment has arrived! ||| chum t-shohbidch ahchim mach ha ahgid g goꞌol hemajkam hegai mat hekaj wo e doꞌibia. T id ab wabsh baꞌich i geꞌedaj g pi ap ha-chuꞌijig. Kut heg gam hu ai mat ab ha wui wo jiwia g wehs s-koꞌok ha-namkidadag.
<sax> For what gives us hope, what makes us happy, what we are really proud of as we stand before our Lord Jesus Christ when he comes back—is having you there too!  You are our pride and joy! ||| M eda d ahpim mach am si em-hiwig ch em-hekaj wo si s-hehgigk ch ab wo si hoꞌigeꞌel g t-kownalig Jesus mat hekid ep wo jiwia.
<sax> So when we couldn't bear it any longer, we decided it would be best for us to stay behind in Athens,  and send Timothy on to you. He is our brother and God's co-worker in spreading the good news of Christ. We sent him to strengthen and encourage you in your trust in God ||| Am att i pi t-nako am em-chegitokch. Kum s-mahch matt am i kei g t-wehnag Timothy mat am wo him k am wo em-nei. Tt ahchim am hejel wih Athens kihhim t am. Timothy o si s-ap ahgachug g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh ab amjed g Christ. Kutt hab i t-ah mat am wo him k am wo i em-gewkemhun k am wo i gewkai g em-wohochudadag.
<sax> so that none of you would be upset by your troubles—for you know we should expect such things. ||| Kumt hab pi hedai wo shaꞌi dagito g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga heg hekaj e-shoꞌigchudadag. Am am wa s-mahch matt wo t-shoꞌigch id hekaj t-wohochudadag.
<sax> Even while we were with you we kept on warning you that we would suffer persecution soon— and as you well know that is exactly what has happened. ||| Id ach wa heki hu am em-ahgid mach eda am em-wehmajkahim. Kum s-mahch mat wa woho hab e juh.
<sax> This is why, when I couldn't stand it anymore, I sent to find out whether you were still trusting in God. I was concerned that the Devil  had successfully tempted you and that all our work had been for nothing! ||| Kunid s-gihug mat am hu wo i em-bijim g ge Jiawul. Kut wo heki e wua g t-chikpan am em-shahgid. Nt pi ni-nako manis am baꞌich ep wo i neahi k hekaj am i kei g Timothy mat wo s-mai mams am wabsh kia ab s-wohochud.
<sax> Now Timothy has just returned from visiting you and he has brought us good news of your trust in God and the love you have. He's told us that you still have fond memories of us, longing to see us just as we long to see you. ||| T hemuch ia ep jiwia ab em-amjed k ia uꞌapa g s-ta hohhoꞌidam ahga ab amjed g em-wohochudadag ch pihk em-elidadag. Am o t-ahgid mam chum hekid si s-ap am t-chegito ch hab wa masma chum s-t-neidamk mach ahchim has i masma chum s-em-neidamk.
<sax> This news really encouraged us while we were suffering troubles ourselves, brothers and sisters, knowing that you continue to hold on to your trust in God. ||| Muꞌi ach haꞌichu nakog ch muꞌi t-shoꞌigchud. K wabshaba g em-wohochudadag ab t-gewkemhun.
<sax> For us life is worth living now because you're standing firm in the Lord! ||| S-gegokim amki ab s-wohochud g t-kownalig Jesus. Kuch ab si t-nenenashanichud
<sax> May God our Father and our Lord Jesus make it possible for us to come to see you soon. ||| Mat hems wo waꞌi t-hiwigi g t-ohg Jiosh ch t-kownalig Jesus matt am wo wa ep em-nei.
<sax> May the Lord increase your love so it overflows to one another, and to everyone, just as we love you. ||| Ab ach tahni g Jiosh mat baꞌich ab wo i em-mah g gewkdag mamt hekaj wo si pihk e elidad ab aꞌai e wui ch ab ha wui g wehs hemajkam.
<sax> In this way may the Lord strengthen you so you may stand with minds that are holy and blameless before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his holy ones. ||| Kumt s-gegokim ab wo wohochudad g Jiosh ch ab wui wo gawulkdask ab amjed g pi apꞌekam mamt pi wo ha chuꞌijigk mat hekid ep wo jiwia g t-kownalig Jesus wehs ha wehm hegam mo d hemajkamgaj ch heki hu koi.
<sax> A few more things: Brothers and sisters, we plead with you and urge you in the Lord Jesus to behave in ways that please God, just as we instructed you. Of course you're already doing this, just do it more and more! ||| Pegih, t-wepnag, am ach wa em-ahgid mamt has masma wo himad g e-doakag ch hab wo hohhoꞌidach g Jiosh. Ab amt bei g haꞌichu t-ahga. Kuch hemuch ab si em-tahni ch ab em-chehani am wehhejed g t-kownalig Jesus mamt baꞌich am hab wo i junihid.
<sax> You remember the instructions we gave you on behalf of the Lord Jesus. ||| S-mahch am mach wa has masma am em-shelinid g gewkdajkaj.
<sax> What God wants is for you to live holy lives. So stay away from sexual immorality ||| Jiosh o em-tatchuid mamt ab wo si i e gawulkai pi apꞌekam amjed k wo si e nuhkud g hejel e-wehm kihkam wehhejed.
<sax> in order that each of you may control yourselves  in a way that is holy and respectful, ||| Ahpim chechoj amt wo s-mahchk mamt wo si s-ap ha hohnt am tahgio g Jiosh ch am hemajkam ha tahgio.
<sax> not indulging passionate lust like the heathen who have no knowledge of God. ||| Hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh o wabsh hejel e-tatchui wehhejed bebhe g uwi. Mt wabshaba ahpim pi hab masma wo be
<sax> So anyone who rejects this position isn't just rejecting what a human being is saying; they are rejecting God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you. ||| K heg hekaj ab t-mahkch g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag. Hegai matp hedai wo s-ohhod ihda mashchama at wo s-ohhod g Jiosh.
<sax> We certainly don't need to write and tell you to love fellow believers, because God teaches you to love one another— ||| Heki atsh hu i em-tashogi g Jiosh mamt wo si pihk e elidad wehs ha hekaj g e-wehm wohochuddam. K pi hab chum mahs machs am hu ep wo ge em-oꞌohani ab amjed.
<sax> and in fact you are demonstrating this love to all the believers throughout Macedonia. Even so we want to encourage you, brothers and sisters, to love more and more. ||| Si amsh pihk e elid wehs ha hekaj g e-wehm wohochuddam am wehs Macedonia jewed ch ed. Kuch wabshaba ab si em-tahni mamt baꞌich am hab wo i e junihid.
<sax> Try to live a quiet life, minding your own business, doing your own work, as we've already explained to you, ||| Am g wo i e nakog mamt wo s-dodolimak ch am hab wo junihid g hejel e-chikpan ch wo haꞌichu e gahgidad. Id ach wa heki hu hab em-ahgid.
<sax> so that your way of life may be respected by non-Christians and you won't have to rely on anyone to provide what you need. ||| Bamt masma pi hedai ab hu wo hiwgad mas ab wabsh wo em-mah hegai mam haschu i tatchua. T hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh wo em-nei mam s-chikpnadag k ab wo si has em-elidad.
<sax> We don't want you to be confused about what happens when people die,  brothers and sisters, so that you won't grieve like others who don't have any hope. ||| Si ach em-tatchuid mamt wo s-mahchk g wohokam ab ha amjed hegam mat heki hu koi. T hahawa pi wo i em-bijim g pi ap tahhadkam hab masma mat hab wo ha juh g pi wohochuddam.
<sax> Since we're convinced that Jesus died and rose again, we're also sure that God will bring with Jesus those who have died trusting in him. ||| Neh, ab at i wuhsh g Jesus muhkig amjed. Kuch s-wohochud ihda ch hekaj ab wui nenea mat g Jiosh ab ep wo i ha wuwhas hegam mat koi ab s-wohochudch g haꞌichu ahgaj ab amjed g Jesus.
<sax> What we're telling you comes from the Lord: those of us who are alive and still here when the Lord comes certainly won't precede those who have died. ||| Hegam atsh wo i wuwha ab amjed g muhkig matt koi an hu wo nam g t-kownalig Jesus.
<sax> So encourage one another with these words. ||| Ab g wo si e gewkemhunad id hekaj haꞌichu ahga.
<sax> Brothers and sisters, we don't need to write anything to you about prophetic times and dates. ||| Pi o hab mahs manis am hu wo em-oꞌohani ab amjed mas hekid hab wo i e juh ihda haꞌichu mani am ahg.
<sax> You yourselves know very well that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night. ||| Am am wa s-ap s-mahch mat chum s-aꞌagi wo e ai mat ep wo jiwia g t-kownalig Jesus. Neh, pi o ta machima mas hekid wo i jiwia g s-chu ehskam chuhug ch ed, o mas hekid wo i e ai mat g uwi ab wo taht g s-koꞌok k wo bei g ali. K hab waꞌap pi ta machima am ha wehhejed g pi e doꞌibiakam mas hekid ep wo jiwia g t-kownalig.
<sax> When people talk about peace and security suddenly they will be completely ruined. It will be just like the sudden onset of childbirth, and they certainly won't escape. ||| Idam at hab wo kaijjid mo wehs haꞌichu am wabsh i si s-apꞌe ch s-dodolima. T am wabsh wo si e ai mat wo e koꞌijid k pi wo e doꞌibia.
<sax> But you, brothers and sisters, are not in the dark about this so that you won't be caught by surprise when the Day of Judgment  arrives suddenly like a thief. ||| Kum eda ahpim e doꞌibiakam s-mahch ihda. K pi hab chum mahs mat s-aꞌagi wo jiwia hegai tash em-wui hab sha masma mo g s-chu ehskam.
<sax> For you are all children of light and children of the day. We don't belong to the night or to darkness. ||| Jiosh o haꞌichu t-tashogid. Kuch an uꞌukch g tonlig hab masma mo hegam mo am tash ed hihim.
<sax> So then we shouldn't be sleeping like everybody else—we should stay awake and keep ourselves clear-headed. ||| Pegih, tt wo chum s-nenenashanik ch pi hab wo masmak mo g nawkkoi.
<sax> For it's during the night that people sleep; and it's at night that they get drunk. ||| Hegam mo pi nenenashanik ch nawkkoꞌo o am eda g s-chuhugam.
<sax> He's the one who died for us so that whether we're alive or dead we shall live together with him. ||| Heg at muh t-wehhejed k i wuhsh matt d wo dodakamk wehmaj. K wabsh chum has masma s-apꞌe chum achs wo heki hu koi o in d wabsh wo kia dodakamk mat wo jiwia.
<sax> So encourage and strengthen one another, just as you are doing. ||| Mt heg hekaj ab wabsh wo si aꞌai e gewkemhunad ch ab aꞌai haꞌichukaj wo i e wehmajk mam am hab wa e junihim.
<sax> Brothers and sisters, we're asking you to respect those who work with you, who lead you in the Lord and teach you. ||| Ab ach si em-tahni mamt s-ap ab wo ha neidad g e-wanimeddam ch hegam mo am em-mashcham ch ab shohbidch g pi apꞌekam em-shahgid. Do Jiosh hab elida mo hab wua.
<sax> You should value them highly in love for the work they do. Live in peace with each other. ||| Ab g wo si has ha elidad ch s-ha hoꞌigeꞌidad no pi hab wua a Jiosh chikpan. Am g wabsh wo s-dodolim kihk e wehm.
<sax> We urge you, brothers and sisters, to warn those who are lazy, encourage those who are anxious, help those who are weak, and be patient with everyone. ||| Ab ach si em-tahni mamt wo ha ahgidad hegam mo s-papadma mat wo chikpanad. Ab g wo i ha gewkemhunad hegam mo pi wihnam gegok am e-wohochudadag ed. I g wo ha wehmtad hegam mo pi ha gewpdag ch ab wehsijj wo si ha bahbgi.
<sax> Make sure none of you pays back evil for evil, but always try to do good to one another, and to everyone. ||| Pi g am uhpam wo agwua mat hema s-koꞌokam wo em-juh k wabshaba chum hekid am wo i e nakogad mamt s-ap haꞌichu hab wo wuad ab aꞌai e wui ch ab wehs ha wui g hemajkam.
<sax> Always be full of joy, ||| Chum g hekid wo s-ap e tahtkkad.
<sax> never stop praying, ||| Chum g hekid wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahunad.
<sax> don't look down on prophecy, ||| Pi g am wo s-kaihogi hegam mo g Jiosh ab ha mahkch g haꞌichu ahga
<sax> make sure to check everything. Hold onto whatever is good; ||| k wabshaba wehs haꞌichu wo i aꞌappemad ch g s-apꞌekam ab wo uꞌukchid.
<sax> keep away from every kind of evil. ||| Im g hu wehs hab wo i juhni g pi apꞌekam.
<sax> May the God of peace himself make you completely holy, and may your whole being—body, mind and spirit—be kept blameless for when our Lord Jesus Christ returns. ||| Jiosh o ab t-mahkch g s-ap tahhadkam. Kuni ab tahni mat wehs gam hu hab wo i juh g pi apꞌekam ab em-amjed k wo si nuhkudad g em-doakag ch em-ihbdag ch em-hon mat d wo hekia s-apꞌekamk. Mt am hahawa pi wo ha chuꞌijigk mat ep wo jiwia g t-kownalig Jesus Christ.
<sax> The One who calls you is trustworthy, and he will do this. ||| Jiosh at ab i em-wai e wui k chum hekid hab junihim mo has i kaij.
<sax> Brothers and sisters, pray for us. ||| Am g wo t-wehhejed e hoꞌigeꞌidahunad.
<sax> Greet all the believers there affectionately. ||| Am g wo ha ahgid g t-wehm wohochuddam mat ab wo i s-t-hoꞌigeꞌel.
<sax> I'm requiring you by the Lord that this letter be read to all the believers. ||| Ni ab si em-chehani g t-kownalig Jesus gewkdagkaj mamt am wo neꞌokchul ihda oꞌohana am wehs ha wui g t-wehm wohochuddam amai.
<sax> When I was on my way to Macedonia I asked you to stay behind in Ephesus, so that you could speak with those who teach false ideas and insist that they stop. ||| Ab ani wa si s-ap m-ahgid mapt am wo wih Ephesus t am mani wa am him gam hu wo himk Macedonia wui. Am g wabsh i dakad ch am wo si ha keshwua hegam mo g iattogi chum ha mashcham.
<sax> They shouldn't concern themselves with legends and never-ending obsessions about ancestry. Such ideas only lead to pointless debates, instead of understanding God as we trust in him. ||| Idam o chum ha mashcham mo g hohoꞌoki aꞌagida ab wehnags g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch ep chum ha mashcham mat hemho wa wo s-chegitok g e-shohshonbad ha-chechgig. T wabshaba ihda ha-mashchama hab wo ha juh mat wo dagito g Jiosh hab elida k ab wabsh aꞌai wo e neꞌowinad. Bat waꞌi masma wo s-mahchk g Jiosh hab elida mat ab wo i s-wohoch g haꞌichu ahgaj.
<sax> The reason why I insist on this is so we may have love that comes from a pure heart, from a clear conscience and sincere trust in God. ||| Pt wo ha ahgi mat woho ab wo s-wohochudad g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch heg hab wo waꞌi junihid mo haschu s-mahch mo d s-apꞌekam ch hab pi wo e kudutad. Id at hab wo ha juh mat wo i geꞌeda g ha-tatchuidag.
<sax> Some have deviated from these things, and have ended up talking nonsense. ||| Haꞌi at dagito g e-wohochudadag k hekaj wabsh ha wehm e neꞌowin.
<sax> They have ambitions to be teachers of the law, but they have no idea what they're talking about or what they're so boldly announcing! ||| Idam o hab chum e elid mo d chehanig ha mashchamdam ch wabshaba pi amichud g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga chum as hab e elid mo s-e mahchk ch neneok.
<sax> Now we recognize that the law is good if people use it properly.  We also know that law isn't laid down for those who do what is right, but for those who are rebellious and ignore the law. It applies to people who have no use for God, who are sinful, who treat nothing as holy and are completely irreligious. It's for those who kill fathers and mothers, for murderers, ||| S-apꞌe o g chehanig. K wabshaba idam pi ap hekaj am chum ha shohbidch hegam mo hab wua g s-apꞌekam. K eda g chehanig chum e hekaj mat wo ha shohbi hegam mo g pi apꞌekam hab wua. Idam o pi ab hu has elid g Jiosh ch pi ab hu wohog elid. Haꞌijj o s-ha muꞌamk chum hems g e-ohg o g e-jeꞌe.

<sax> as determined by the wonderful good news of our blessed God which he entrusted to me. ||| Jiosh o ni-nuhkudachud ihda s-kehg haꞌichu e-ahga. K heg am t-tashogid ihda mant em-ahgi.
<sax> Our Lord in his grace filled me to overflowing with trust and love that comes from Christ Jesus. ||| Si at s-hemajim ab ni-wui i e tashogi. Nt hab ab i s-wohochud k ab i ni-hemakoj wehmaj k ab wui a pihk ni-elid.
<sax> You can trust this saying that everyone should accept: “Christ Jesus came to this world to save sinners,” and I'm the worst of them.  For this reason I was shown mercy—since I'm the worst sinner, Jesus Christ could demonstrate his infinite patience as an example to those who choose to trust in him and gain eternal life. ||| Neh, hema hab cheꞌidag o hab chuꞌig, “Ia at jiwia g t-kownalig Jesus jewed dahm mat wo ha doꞌibia g pi ap chuꞌijkam.” K id d si wohokam nat pi ab si s-ni-hoꞌigeꞌel.

<sax> These are the instructions I want to give to you, Timothy, my son, following the prophecies that brought you this far,  so you can fight the good fight! ||| Pegih, ni wehnag, Timothy, heki o hu am i t-tashogid g Jiosh maptki am hab wo junihid ihda chikpan. Kuni ab ep i m-gewkemhun mapt hab wo wa junihid. Hegai Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ab m-wui at hab wo masmak mo g s-kehg cheggiakud. Pt hekaj ab wui kehkkad g ge Jiawul.
<sax> Keep on trusting God and make sure you have a clear conscience. Some have refused to do this and have shipwrecked their trust in God. ||| An g si uꞌukchid g e-wohochudadag ch heg hab wo waꞌi junihid map haschu s-mahch mo d s-apꞌekam. Haꞌijj oki pi hab masma ch hekaj padch g e-wohochudadag.
<sax> Hymenaeus and Alexander are such people, and I have “handed them over to Satan” to teach them not to misrepresent God. ||| Hymanaeus ch Alexander oki haꞌi hegam ch pi ap has ahg g Jiosh. Nt gam hu i ha dagito ge Jiawul wui mat wo e shoꞌigchud k atp hems wo dagito g pi ap e-chuꞌijig.
<sax> First of all, I want to encourage you to pray for everybody: make requests of God, ask on their behalf, and give thanks. ||| Si ani s-m-ahgidamk mapt wo haꞌichu ha ahgi g t-wehm wohochuddam.

<sax> Pray like this for kings and all types of leaders so that we may live quiet and peaceful lives, always thinking about God and taking life seriously. ||| K hab ep mahs mat wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahunad am ha wehhejed g kokownal ch uꞌusagakam mat idam s-ap hab wo junihid g e-chikpan.

<sax> For there is one God, and one mediator of God and mankind—the man Christ Jesus. ||| Do waꞌi hemako g t-ohg Jiosh. K hab waꞌap d waꞌi hemako g si Kehshaj ch d Jesus Christ ch d waꞌi hegai mat i t-hemakoch g Jiosh wehm. Jesus Christ at t-wepo e juh mat d wo oꞌodhamk
<sax> He gave himself so we could all be won back, demonstrating the evidence at the right time. ||| ch ab wo bei g s-koꞌok t-namkidadag k hab wo t-doꞌibia. Id o am t-chehgidch mo wehs hemajkam s-ha doꞌibiamk g Jiosh.
<sax> I was appointed to share this message and be its messenger,  a teacher to the foreigners about trusting God and the truth (I'm not lying, I'm telling the truth!). ||| Kut heg hekaj am i ni-kei mant wo i ahgahi ab amjed g alidaj k wo ha mashcha g gawul mahs hemajkam g wohokam.

<sax> What I really want is for men everywhere to pray sincerely to God.  No anger or arguments! ||| Bant wo chei mat wahm g chechoj ab wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahunad Jiosh wui ch atp hems am wo uhgk uhꞌul e-nohnhoi. S-ap at haꞌichu hab wo elidad ch pi wo shaꞌi s-bagak ab hedai i wui.
<sax> In the same way, women should dress sensibly, modestly, and appropriately. They should be attractive not in their hairstyle or by wearing gold or pearls or expensive clothes, ||| Kunt hab ep wo chei mat g uꞌuwi wabsh s-ap ab wo e enigadadch ch ep s-ap hab wo juhkchid g e-moꞌo mat pi heg hekaj wo chum si e hahaschudad.
<sax> but by the good things they do—as is appropriate for women who claim to follow God. ||| Ab o ha ab mat chum hekid am hab wo junihid g s-apꞌekam ch heg amjed wo e chehgidch mo d wohochuddam.
<sax> Women should learn quietly, respecting their place. ||| Ab o d ep ha-wuikam mat wabsh s-bahbagi ch s-dodolim ab wo kaiham k wo mahchid g Jiosh himdag.
<sax> I don't allow women to be instructors, or to dominate men; let them remain quiet. ||| Ahni ani pi shaꞌi ha hiwgid g uꞌuwi mas wo ha mashcha g chechoj o am ha dahm wo e uhꞌulinchid.
<sax> However women will be saved through becoming mothers, as long as they continue to trust and love, and to live holy, sensible lives. ||| T g Jiosh heg hekaj ab ha mah g uꞌuwi mat wo e shoꞌigch hekid am i ha mamsijid g aꞌal.

<sax> He should be someone who doesn't get drunk or become violent, but is gentle, and is not argumentative or greedy for money. ||| Pi o hab chuꞌig mas wo nawkkoꞌod o s-hohtam wo babgatad o wo ha kawnid o heg waꞌi lial ab wo si tatchuad.
<sax> He must handle his own family well. His children must respect what he tells them to do. ||| S-hemajim at am wo ha dahmk g e-wehm kihkam. T g aꞌaligaj ab wo wechok ch ab wo si has elidad.
<sax> (For if a man doesn't know how to manage his own family, how can he manage God's church?) ||| Pi at has masma wo s-ap i ha wanim g e-wehm wohochuddam matp pi ap wo ha wanim g e-wehm kihkam.
<sax> He should not be a new believer, in case he gets so full of himself he falls under the same condemnation as the devil. ||| Pi at d wo hema hegamk mat hemuch ab i s-wohoch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga nat pi am hu wo chum si e haschudad ch wo i gei hab masma matsh wa g ge Jiawul hab e juh.

<sax> They should be tried out first, and if they can't be faulted then let them serve as deacons. ||| Wehpeg amt am wo i ha mamche k am haha wo i ha chuhcha matp s-ap am hab wo masmak.
<sax> Their wives should be respected too. They should not slander people with gossip, and they should be self-controlled and trustworthy in all they do. ||| Uꞌuwi chikpandam at hab waꞌap s-ap d wo uꞌuwik ch pi wo chu ahgamk ch pi wo nawkkoꞌod ch pi wo chu iattomk.

<sax> Even though I hope to see you soon, I'm writing about all this to you so that  if I'm delayed you'll know how people should behave themselves in God's house. This is the church of the living God, the support pillar and foundation of the truth. ||| Bani chum ni-tahtk mant s-hohtam am wo i m-chehgim. Tp wabshaba hems pi wo ni-apꞌet.

<sax> There's no question about it: the revealed truth about God is amazing! He was made known to us in human form, he was vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, declared to the nations, trusted in by the world, and taken up in glory! ||| Pi o wa ta machima matt has masma wo s-apꞌekamk am Jiosh tahgio. T wabshaba id am i t-tashogi g Jiosh. K d wohokam ihda mo an hab chuꞌig neꞌi ed:
<sax> However the Spirit very clearly explains that in the last times some will abandon their trust in God, and will listen to deceptive spirits and beliefs that come from demons. ||| Si o tasho am i ni-tashogid g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag mat ab wo i e ai g tash mat muꞌi wo dagito g e-wohochudadag.

<sax> These hypocritical liars, whose consciences have been seared, ||| Hegam mat chum hekid wo ha iattogidad at pi wo shaꞌi e kudutad heg hekaj nat pi ged hu wabsh wo i ha apꞌet.
<sax> since it is made sacred by the word of God and by prayer. ||| Bo kaij g Jiosh mat g hoꞌigeꞌidahuna am wo i apꞌech nenaj ed.
<sax> If you point out these things to the brothers and sisters you will be a good minister  of Christ Jesus. You gain strength by trusting in the truth, and in the good teaching you've followed. ||| Dapt wo s-apꞌekam piongajk g Jesus Christ maptp am wo i ha ahgi g t-wehm wohochuddam ihda haꞌichu mashchama. Kupt an wabsh s-ap wo uꞌukchid g e-wohochudadag ch wehs haꞌichu mashchama ab amjed map hab hi wa masma hab e wua.
<sax> Reject what is irreligious, and old wives' tales. Make sure your exercise is spiritual— ||| Pi g am hab masma hekaj g hohoꞌoki aꞌagida mas d Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. Pi at hab wo em-juh mamt wo s-aꞌapꞌek am Jiosh nena ed. Am apt wo si e mashchamad mapt am hab wo junihid s-apꞌekam himdag.
<sax> for while physical exercise is useful to some extent, spiritual exercise is much more useful. For “it has promise for the present life, and for the life to come.” ||| S-apꞌe mapt wo e momoisha k wo s-gewkk. K wabshaba ab him g tash mat wo huhug ihda. K heg hekai baꞌich i s-apꞌe mapt wo i e gewkai am e-wohochudadag ed. Id o ab m-mahkch g s-apꞌekam doakag idani ch imhab i baꞌich.
<sax> You can trust this saying that should be accepted by everyone. ||| Do si wohokam ihda haꞌichu ahga. K hab chuꞌig mat wehs ab wo i chum s-e wohoch.
<sax> The reason we work and do the best we can is because our hope is in the living God. He is the Savior of all people, especially of those who trust in him. ||| Jiosh at wehs wo ha doꞌibia hegam mat ab wo i s-wohoch g haꞌichu ahgaj k am wo i e gewpkai wui. Kuch ab s-wohochud ch heg hekaj am si t-nakog ch muꞌi haꞌichu ab nakog matt wo ha ahgi hemajkam ab amjed ihda.
<sax> This is what you should teach. Tell everyone to follow your instructions. ||| Am g i ha mashcham ihda mani m-ahgid k ab i ha chehani mat am hab wo junihid.
<sax> Don't let anyone look down on you because you are young. Be an example to those who trust in God—in the way you speak, the kind of life you live, in love, in trust, and in purity. ||| Bapt masma s-ap hab wo e junihid ch s-ap wo neokad.

<sax> Think carefully about these things, and dedicate yourself completely to them so that everyone can see the progress you're making. ||| T hab ab wo i e gewkemhunad g wohochuddam an m-neidch.
<sax> Mind what you're doing and what you're teaching. Keep going with all of this, because as you do so you'll save both yourself and those who listen to you. ||| Si g s-e nenꞌoid map has e junihim ch haschu ha mashcham k hekaj pi wabsh wo heki wua g e-doakag. T hegam mat ab wo m-kaiha hab waꞌap pi wo heki wua g e-dodakag.
<sax> Don't rebuke a man who is older than you. Instead, encourage him as if he were your father. Treat younger men as brothers, ||| Pi g ab wabsh si chehmod g keli oꞌodham k wabshaba ab wabsh wo s-ap haꞌichu kakke hab masma mapt g hejel e-ohg hab chum masma hab wo juhkchid. Wechij oꞌodham apt hab masma ab wo ha neidad mo d m-wepnag.
<sax> older women as mothers, younger women as sisters, with the highest standards of decency. ||| ch g oꞌoki hab masma map g e-jeꞌe ch g wechij uꞌuwi hab masma mo d m-uꞌuwiga. Pt wabsh si s-ap wo ha chegitokad.
<sax> Help widows who don't have a family. ||| Am g ha ahgid hegam mo am hemiap e mihshmad mat wo ha nuhkud hegam mo d si heheꞌejel wiꞌikam uꞌuwi.
<sax> For the Christian responsibility of a widow's children or grandchildren is to do their duty for their own family, and repay their parents by helping them out. This is what pleases God. ||| K wabshaba pi ab hu ha ab mas wo ha nuhkud hegam mo ge aꞌaliga. Idam ha-aꞌaliga at wo chum ha nuhkud nat pi ha geꞌegel. K d Jiosh tatchui mat aigo epai wo i ha wehmtad,
<sax> Now a real widow, having no family, alone and without support, puts her hope in God and prays for help night and day. ||| Hegam mo woho d si heheꞌejel wihpkam o heg ab waꞌi hiwig Jiosh ch chum hekid ab tahni g i wehmtadag. Idam amt wo ha nuhkudad
<sax> But a widow who concentrates on pleasing herself is already dead, even though she's still physically alive. ||| ch wabshaba wabsh wo ha dagito hegam mo wabsh e gahgid g s-tahhadkam.
<sax> Only widows over sixty who have been faithful to their husbands should be put on the list. ||| Pi at an hu wo ha ui g wechij uꞌuwi mat wo ha nuhkud. Hegam mat wo i ha wehmtad at wo aisk g chuhdpo wehst-mahm aꞌahidag ch d wo hegamk mo s-ap e nuhkudahim g e-kunbad wehhejed
<sax> The widow should have a reputation for doing good. Did she bring up children properly? Has she been hospitable? Has she washed the feet of church members? Has she helped those who were in trouble? Has she really tried to do good in every way? ||| ch s-ap ha geꞌegel g aꞌal ch s-ap ha nuhkud g Jiosh wohochuddam ch wehsko s-e mahch mo haꞌichukaj i ha wehmt hegam mo tatchua g i wehmtadag, chum as hems pi d wo ha-machigak.
<sax> Don't take on widows who are younger, because when their physical desires make them want to re-marry they abandon their dedication to Christ.  In this they are guilty of breaking their previous commitment. ||| Wechij uꞌuwi atp hems ep wo s-kuhkuntam mo eda hab chum kaij mat pi hab wo e juh k wabsh wo chikpani g Jiosh, neh, k hab masma wo e chuꞌijigchud k gam hu hab wo i e juh ab amjed g Christ.
<sax> They also get used to a lazy life, just visiting each other in their homes. Not only lazy, but they gossip and meddle, talking about things they shouldn't. ||| Haꞌi atp hems wabsh wo s-e papadmakamch an oiopodch ha-kihki oidch, wahm baꞌich i pi apꞌe mat wo mai g has ahgadag k an wo gantanad g pi kehg haꞌichu ahga.
<sax> So my best advice is that younger widows marry and have children and take care of the home. That way there's no opportunity for criticism from the Enemy.  However some have already gone the way of Satan. ||| Haꞌi at heki hu hab masma hab e juh k am i oi g Jiawul. Id o hekaj baꞌich i a-apꞌe mat g wechij uꞌuwi ep wo kuhkunt k wo mahmadt k wo s-ap dagioꞌi g e-kihdag. T heg hekaj g t-obga pi wo e nako mas wo pi ap has t-ahgad.
<sax> Any Christian woman who has widows in the family should help them, so that the church is not burdened with the responsibility, and can help those widows who are truly in need. ||| Am g ha ahgid g uꞌuwi mat wo i ha dagioꞌi g heheꞌejel wihpkam e-hajuni k pi ab hu hedai wo mohtoꞌi. Hegam mo am hemiap e mihshmad at hegam wo waꞌi ha dagioꞌi mo d si heheꞌejel wihpkam
<sax> Elders who direct the church well should be seen as doubly valuable,  particularly those who work in speaking the Word and in teaching. ||| Am g wehs ha ahgid mat ab wo si has i ha elidad hegam mo d kekel em-wanimeddam ch s-ap am hab junihim g e-chikpan, wahm hegam mo si chikpan ch hab junihim g mashchama ch mihshmda.
<sax> As Scripture says, “You must not muzzle the ox when it is threshing the corn.” Also, “The worker deserves to be paid.” ||| An o oꞌohanas Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana ed:
<sax> Before God and Christ Jesus, and the holy angels, I instruct you to follow these instructions without bias. Don't do anything from an attitude of favoritism. ||| Am g wehs wepo masma hab ha juhni idam mani m‑shelinid k pi hedai shaꞌi gam hu wo i gawulkai. Id ani si s‑bahbagi ab m‑chehani am ha tahgio g Jiosh ch Jesus ch am ha tahgio g hekia s‑apꞌekam anghil.
<sax> Don't be in a hurry to lay hands on anyone; and don't get involved in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure. ||| Pi g am wabsh si s‑e hohtkid mapt am wo hema i kei mat wo chikpani g Jiosh. Tp hems d pi ap chuꞌijkam. Kut d wo m‑chuꞌijig mapt s‑hohtam am i kei.
<sax> Don't just drink water, but use a little bit of wine because of your bad stomach—you're sick so often! The sins of some people are really obvious, and they are clearly guilty, but the sins of others are not seen until later.  Similarly some good works are obvious, and even those that are hidden won't be for long. ||| Haꞌi o g pi ap ha‑chuꞌijig am tasho e neid. Kum s‑ap s‑mahch ch pi woho am hu wo i ha chuhcha idam.

Chum as hi wa pi am hu i si tasho ch wabshaba pi wo ehsto g s‑kehg ha‑chikpan imhab i baꞌich.
<sax> All who are bound under slavery should consider their masters worthy of respect, so that God's name and Christian beliefs won't be defamed. ||| Hegam wohochuddam mo d nenehol at ab wo si has ha elidad g e‑aꞌamo. T heg hekaj pi hedai wo has ahgad g Jiosh ch pi wo has ahgad g t‑mashchama.
<sax> Slaves who have Christian masters should not disrespect them because they are brothers. Instead they should serve them even better, because those who are benefiting from their service are fellow-believers they should love. Teach these instructions, and encourage people to follow them. ||| Hegam mo g ha‑aꞌamo hab waꞌap d wohochuddam at baꞌich ab wo i si has ha elidad ch baꞌich i s‑ap wo ha chikpani nat pi g ha‑chikpan d wo ha‑apꞌedagk g ha‑wehm wohochuddam.
<sax> Those that teach different beliefs, and don't listen to good counsel, particularly the words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the true teachings of God,  are arrogant and don't understand anything. They're obsessed with speculation and philosophical debates which only lead to jealousy, arguments, malicious gossip and evil suspicions— ||| Ho o wabsh chum si e hahaschud ch d wabsh pi haꞌichu mahchim hegam mat hedai i pi heg hekaj wo ha mashcha t‑kownalig Jesus Christ mashchama.

<sax> the constant arguing of people whose minds are totally corrupt and who have lost the truth, thinking that they can profit financially from religion… ||| Kut hegam wo ha kawhainad matp hedam pi ap haꞌichu chegito ch pi mahch g wohokam ch hab chum elid mat g oꞌodham wo s‑e kaisch id hekaj t‑himdag.
<sax> But knowing and following God is so incredibly satisfying! ||| K wabshaba id d s‑wohokam s‑t‑kaisdag matt wo himad g s‑apꞌekam ch wo si s‑ap t‑tahtkkad, chum achs pi haꞌichu wo edgidad.
<sax> Those who are determined to become rich fall into the trap of temptation, following many foolish and damaging impulses. ||| Hegam mo s‑e kaischudamk at heg hekaj hab wo s‑junim g pi apꞌekam. T g ha‑tatchui gam hu hab wo i ha juh ab amjed g Jiosh. Kut haꞌi ep wo ha padch.
<sax> For the desire to be rich leads to many kinds of evil results. Some of those who longed for this have turned away from the truth, and have hurt themselves, experiencing a lot of pain. ||| Nahnko mahs pi apꞌekam o ab shohshon heg amjed mat hema heg waꞌi lialkaj wo si pihk e elidad. Haꞌi at heg hekaj im hu hab i e juh ab amjed g e‑wohochudadag k oi wa muꞌi haꞌichu pi ap tahhadkam ab nako.
<sax> But you as a man of God should run away from such things. You should seek to do what is right, practice true religion, and trust in God. Aim to love, to be patient, and gentle. ||| Pi g hab masma hab e juhni mo hegam mani am ha ahg nap pi d Jiosh chikpandamga.

<sax> Fight the good fight as you trust in God. Hold on tightly to the eternal life to which you were called. This is what you promised to do in front of many witnesses. ||| Am g si e gewkad wehhejed g Jiosh k wo s‑wihnam uꞌukchid g e‑wohochudadag mapt hekaj am wo i wah Jiosh kihdag ed hab masma mat g s‑melidkam hab wo e juh mat wo ha gehg.
<sax> My charge to you before God the Life-giver, and before Christ Jesus who testified to the good news before Pontius Pilate,  is to follow faithfully what you've been told so you will be above criticism until our Lord Jesus Christ appears. ||| Bapt wabsh masma hab wo e juh matsh wa g t‑kownalig Jesus natsh pi heg s‑ap ah g wohokam am tahgio hegai geꞌe kownal mo hab chehgig Pontius Pilate.

<sax> Warn those who are rich in the present world not to become proud. Tell them not to place their trust in wealth that is so insecure but in God who so freely gives us everything for our enjoyment. ||| Ab g i ha chehani hegam mo d s‑kakais mat pi wo si e hahaschudad heg hekaj haꞌichu e‑eniga ch pi ab hu wo hiwgad ch wabshaba ab wo hiwgad g Jiosh.

<sax> If we are in distress, it is for your comfort and salvation. If we are being comforted, it is for your comfort, which results in you patiently bearing the same sufferings that we suffer. ||| Ahchim ach wa t-shoꞌigchud am i em-wehmajch mamt wo e doꞌibia.

<sax> You help us by praying for us. In this way many will thank God for us because of the blessing that God will give us in response to the prayers of many. ||| Kum ahpim am i t-wehmaj am e hoꞌigeꞌidahunch t-wehhejed. T g Jiosh am hab wo juh mam haschu ab tahni k ab wo s-t-hoꞌigeꞌel. T muꞌi ab wo hoꞌigeꞌel g Jiosh t-hekaj.
<sax> We take pride in the fact—and our conscience confirms it—that we have acted properly towards people, and especially to you. We have followed God's principles of holiness and sincerity, not according to worldly wisdom but through the grace of God. ||| Jiosh o si s-hemajim ab t-mahkch g gewkdag.

<sax> For we are not writing anything complicated that you can't read and understand. I hope you'll understand in the end, ||| Heg ach am waꞌi em-oꞌohanid mamt haschu s-ap wo neꞌokchulid k wo s-amich. Am ani hab hi wa chum em-elid mamt am hu wa hebai wehs s-ap wo s-amich
<sax> even if you only understand part of it now, so that when the Lord comes you will be proud of us, just as we are of you. ||| mam haschu wabsh heꞌes i s-amichud hemu. Kumt hekaj baꞌich ab wo si has i t-el hab masma matt ahchim ab wo si has em-el mat hekid wo jiwia g t-kownalig Jesus.
<sax> Because I was so sure of your confidence in me I planned to come and visit you first. That way you could have benefited twice,  as I would go on from you to Macedonia, and then return from Macedonia to you. Then I would have had you send me on my way to Judea. ||| D ant huꞌi heki hu hab masma i chum apꞌech mant am wo i em-nei am himadch Macedonia wui k am ep wo i em-nei ab uhpam himadch.

<sax> Why did I change my original plan? Do you think I make my decisions lightly? Do you think that when I plan I'm like some worldly person who says Yes and No at the same time? ||| Nt eda pi koi am hu i em-chehgim. Kumki haꞌi hab ni-elid mani wabsh pehegi neok ch pi woho am hu hab wo ni-juh mani wa has i kaij.
<sax> Just as God can be trusted, when we give you our word it's not both Yes and No. ||| K eda pi woho ihda. Jiosh o s-mahch mani hab chum s-junimk mani haschu hab i ahg mant hab wo juh.
<sax> God has given both us and you the inner strength to stand firm in Christ. God has appointed us,  placed his stamp of approval on us, and given us the guarantee of the Spirit in our hearts. ||| Do Jiosh mat am i t-gewpkadch Christ himdag ed ab t-mahk g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag. K heg am wohokamchud mach d hemajkamgaj ch wehs wo bei hegai mo ab t-makiog.
<sax> I call God as my witness that it was to avoid causing you pain that I chose not to come to Corinth. ||| S-mahch o g Jiosh mani pi em-kudutamk ch heg hekaj pi koi am hu ep em-wui hih. Baꞌich o i s-apꞌe mamt wehpeg am wo i apꞌech hegai mo pi apꞌe am em-shahgid.
<sax> This isn't because we want to dictate how you relate to God, but because we want to help you have a joyful experience—for it's by trusting God that you stand firm. ||| Pi o hab chum chuꞌig machs ahchim am wo em-nuꞌichkwuhid em-wohochudadag ed. Baꞌich o i s-apꞌe matt am wo i em-gewkemhu em-wohochudadag ed. Kumt hab wo s-gegokkad heg eda.
<sax> That's why I decided that I would avoid another sad visit with you. ||| Am ant si i ni-oidahim k hab i ni-ah mantki pi am hu wo i em-chehgim hemu manis wo ge s-em-kehꞌel.
<sax> For if I make you sad, who will be there to make me happy? It won't be those I've made sad! ||| Mt pi wo ap e taht mantp hab wo ni-juh. Nt ahni hab waꞌap pi wo ap ni-taht.
<sax> That's why I wrote what I did, so that I wouldn't be sad over those who should make me happy. I was so sure that all of you would share in my happiness. ||| Heg ant hekaj am wabsh em-oꞌohani.

<sax> I was crying many tears when I wrote to you, in great anguish and with a heavy heart—not to make you sad, but so you would know how much love I have for you. ||| Si ani pi ap ni-tahtk ch muꞌi ni-ohꞌog iawua am em-oꞌohanidk nani pi si pihk ni-elid em-hekaj.

<sax> Not to put it too strongly, but the person caused more pain to all of you than to me. ||| Ab at i em-mah g pi ap tahhadkam hegai mat am si pi ap has chuꞌi em-shahgid. Kuni pi tatchua manis ab wabsh wo si em-chehmo.
<sax> So I urge you to publicly affirm your love towards him. ||| Am g dahm ep wo ahgid mam ab si pihk e elid wui.
<sax> That's why I wrote: so I could discoverer your true character and whether you're doing everything you were told to do. ||| S-mahchimk ani am i em-oꞌohanidk mams ab wo s-ni-wohog el. Kumt wa woho am hab e juh.
<sax> Anyone you forgive, I forgive too. What I have forgiven, whatever it may be, I have forgiven before Christ for your benefit. ||| Kunt hab waꞌap ab wo i s-hoꞌigeꞌel hegai mat pi ap has chuꞌi mamtp ahpim ab wo i s-hoꞌigeꞌel.
<sax> In this way Satan will not be able to take us in, because we know the tricks he thinks up. ||| T hab pi wo e nako g Jiawul mas wo t-wohppoꞌi ihda t-wehnag. S-mahch ach mo hab wa s-e junimk.
<sax> Now when I arrived in Troas to spread the good news of Christ, the Lord opened a door of opportunity for me. ||| Pegih, nt wa pi am hu em-wui hih am himadch Macedonia wui k wabshaba am hih Troas wui. Tki g Jiosh am apꞌech mant am i ahgachug g haꞌichu ahgaj amai.
<sax> But my mind wasn't at peace because I couldn't find my brother Titus. So I said goodbye and went over to Macedonia. ||| Nt am hu hebai ni-kudu nat pi pi oi jiwia g Titus am i em-chehgimedk. Kunt am i ha hoꞌigeꞌel g t-wehm wohochuddam amai k gam hu hih Macedonia wui. T am ni-nam g Titus k am ni-ahgid mamt s-ap am hab juh g ni-neꞌoki.
<sax> But praise be to God, who always leads us in a triumphal procession in Christ, and reveals through us the sweet scent of his knowledge wherever we go! ||| Kuni heg amjed ab si ihm g Jiosh mat am i apꞌech hegai mo pi apꞌe am em-shahgid. Jiosh o chum hekid ab t-mahkch g gewitoidag hekaj hegai mat g Christ am t-wehhejed hab juh. Haꞌichu t-ahga ab amjed g Christ o an wehsko e gantan hab sha masma mat g s-ap uhwchu wehsko wo e hewagi mat hebai wo e mehi.
<sax> We are like a fragrance of Christ to God, rising up from among those who are being saved as well as those who are dying.  To those who are dying it is the smell of decay, while to those who are being saved it is the scent of life! But who is up to such an assignment? ||| Hegam mat wo e doꞌibia o ab si s-hohhoꞌid ch kah mo g Jiosh ab ha makiog g pi ha huhugedam doakag. K hegam mat pi wo e doꞌibia pi hohhoꞌid ch kah mo am hihim pi ha huhugedam muhkig wui. Pegih, do si s-has haꞌichu chikpan ihda.
<sax> You are our letter, written in our hearts, that everybody reads and knows about.  You demonstrate that you are a letter from Christ, delivered by us; not written with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not written on stone slabs but on human hearts. ||| Ahpim mamt ab i s-wohoch g haꞌichu ni-ahga am heg wa wepo mam d oꞌohanaj g Christ ch am wohokamchud mani d kehshaj. K id pi an hu oꞌohanas hohodai t ab hab masma mash wa hegai heki hu wehst-mahm chehanig ch wabshaba an oꞌohanas em-dodakag ed nat pi g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag gawul em-juh k am i em-apꞌech heg hekaj haꞌichu ni-ahga. Kut wehs wo nei mat has em-juni g Jiosh k wo s-mahchk mani d Christ kehsha.
<sax> We have total confidence before God through Christ. ||| Id ani hab kaij nani pi ab hiwig g Jiosh heg hekaj mat g Christ hab t-juni.
<sax> Not that we would consider ourselves able to do this on our own—it's God who gives us this capacity! ||| Pi o d hejel t-gewpkdag ch wabshaba d Jiosh gewkdag mach hekaj am hab junihim g Jiosh chikpan.
<sax> He also gave us the ability to be ministers of a new agreement, based not on the letter of the law, but on the spirit. The letter of the law kills, but the spirit gives life. ||| K ihda mach ahgachug d wechij haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh. K ab haꞌi kaiham. K g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag ab ha mahk g wechij doakag. Pi o hab masma hegai hekiukam haꞌichu ahgaj ch wabshaba d chehanig. K g pi ap chuꞌijkam heg hekaj s-mahch mo ab ha wui him g s-koꞌok ha-namkidadag.
<sax> However, the old way of relating to God, written in letters carved in stone, ended in death, even though it came with God's glory—so much so that the Israelites couldn't even bear to look at Moses' face because it shone so brightly, even though the glory was fading. ||| Hegai hekiukam chehanig ash an oꞌohanas hohodai t ab. Tsh g Jiosh am ha chehgi g e-gewkdag ch e-tonlig matsh wa ab ha mah ihda g Tutuligo. Mosesbad wuhiosha ash wa si tonod heg hekaj Jiosh gewkdag mash wa an wehmajkahim doꞌag t ab ch ab bei hegai chehanig. Tsh pi shaꞌi e nako g wehmaj oꞌodham mas ab wo i nei g Mosesbad.

<sax> If that was so, shouldn't the new way of relating to God in the Spirit come with even greater glory? ||| k wabshaba baꞌich am t-chehgidch g e-gewkdag mo ab t-mahkch g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag. K heg am t-eda chikpan.
<sax> If the old way that condemns us has glory, the new way that makes us right with God has so much more glory! ||| Do si s-has haꞌichu hegai hekiukam chehanig mach hekaj s-mahch mo ab t-aihim g s-koꞌok t-namkidadag heg hekaj pi ap t-chuꞌijig. Pegih, k baꞌich d i si haꞌichu hegai haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh mach hekaj s-mahch mo gam hu hab i junihog g pi ap t-chuꞌijig matt d haha wo s-apꞌekamk am tahgio.
<sax> For the old that was once glorious has no glory at all in comparison with the incredible glory of the new. ||| T wabsh pi e haꞌichuch g gewkdaj g hekiukam chehanig am t-wehhejed no pi baꞌich i s-gewkdag g Christ haꞌichu ahga.
<sax> We don't have to be like Moses, who had to put on a veil to cover his face so the Israelites wouldn't be dazzled by the glory, even though it was fading away. ||| Mosesbad atsh wa ab maꞌish g e-wuhiosha matsh g wehmaj oꞌodham pi ab hu wo nei hegai tonlig mo ab ab tonod ab amjed g Jiosh gewkdag. Sh hegam pi neid mo huhughim hegai tonlig. Ch ahchim hi pi ab hu maꞌishch hegai Jiosh gewkdag mo ab t-ab e chehgidch.
<sax> In spite of that, their hearts became hard. For right up until today when the old agreement is read, the same “veil” remains. Only through Christ can it be removed. ||| K eda wabsh kia e ehstokch muꞌi ha wehhejed g ni-wehm oꞌodham. K heg hekaj pi mahch mo huhughim g gewkdaj hegai hekiukam chehanig. Im at hu hab wo i e juh hegai pi ha-amichudadag mat hekid ab wo i s-wohoch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ab amjed g Christ.
<sax> Even today, whenever the books of Moses are read, a veil covers their minds. ||| Chum wa hems id i tashkaj o heg wa wepo mo ab maꞌishpi g ha-amichudadag mo hekid am i neꞌokchulid hegai haꞌichu ahga mat g Mosesbad an oꞌoha.
<sax> But when they turn and accept the Lord, the veil is removed. ||| Neh, ab atsh i e maꞌishpiꞌo g Mosesbad matsh hekid ab ep i miabi g Jiosh. T idam ha-amichudadag hab waꞌap wo i e maꞌishpiꞌo mat hekid ab wo i miabi g Jiosh.
<sax> Now the Lord is the Spirit, and wherever the Spirit of the Lord is, there's freedom. ||| Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag o d Jiosh ch am haꞌichug t-doakag ed am i t-apꞌechudk g Jiosh wehhejed. Kuch hab t-wulꞌokch mach pi chum t-apꞌechud g chehanigkaj.
<sax> So all of us, with our faces unveiled, see and reflect the glory of the Lord as in a mirror. We are being transformed into the same mirror image, whose glory grows brighter and brighter. This is what the Lord the Spirit does. ||| Pi o ab hu maꞌishpi g t-amichudadag ahchim mach ab ihm g Christ. Kuch ab wui nea ch ab chehgidch g gewkdaj ch tonligaj hab sha masma mo g neidakud. K g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag am si gawul t-junihim. Tt hekaj baꞌich wo i wepo masmak g Christ.
<sax> So then, since God in his mercy has given us this new way of relating to him, we don't give up. ||| Ab o s-t-hoꞌigeꞌid g Jiosh ch ab t-chehani matt am wo ahgachugad g haꞌichu ahgaj. Heg ach hekaj pi haꞌichukaj t-shohbidch ch heg am hab wua.
<sax> But we have given up secret, shameful acts. We don't behave in deceitful ways and we don't distort the word of God. We demonstrate who we are by revealing the truth before God so everybody can decide in their own minds. ||| Pi ach hab wua g s-aꞌagi haꞌichu ch pi ha iattogid ch pi am hu gawul wua g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. Jiosh o s-mahch mach am ahg g wohokam ch am i t-nakog matt wo s-apꞌek am hemajkam ha-nena ed.
<sax> We are not promoting ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord. In fact we are your servants for Jesus' sake. ||| Pi ach hejel t-amjed haꞌichu ahgachug. Jesus Christ o d t-kownalig. Kuch heg amjed an ahgachug ch d wabsh em-pionag wehhejed.
<sax> For God who said, “Let light shine out of the darkness,” shone in our hearts to illuminate the knowledge of God's glory in the face of Jesus Christ. ||| Jiosh atsh am wa i tonlid g s-chuhugam ged huꞌi si wehpeg. K heg ha wepo mat am epai i tonlid g t-doakag nat pi t-mahtchul g Christ. K heg am t-chehgidch g Jiosh.
<sax> But we have this treasure in clay jars, to show that this supreme power comes from God and not from ourselves. ||| Dach wabsh chum hemajkam. K eda g Jiosh ab t-mahkch g e-gewkdag. T hab wo s-e mahchk mo d wa Jiosh gewkdag ch am t-eda. Kuch heg hekaj hab sha masma mo g bid hahaꞌa mat hema g lai am ha eda wo toꞌakchid g s-e-kaisdag.
<sax> We are attacked from every direction, but we are not crushed. We are at a loss as to what to do, but never in despair. ||| Muꞌikko ach haꞌichukaj t-kudut. K wabshaba pi haꞌichu t-shohbidch. Hebai ach haꞌichu pi aꞌamichud ch wabshaba am wabsh baꞌich i t-gewpkad.
<sax> We are persecuted, but never abandoned by God. We are knocked down, but not dead yet! ||| Muꞌikko am t-shoꞌigchud. K wabshaba g Jiosh chum hekid t-wehmaj. Hebai am hi wa chum si s-koꞌokam has t-wua. Ch wabshaba pi t-koꞌijid.
<sax> In our bodies we always share in the death of Jesus, so that we can also demonstrate the life of Jesus in our bodies. ||| Chum o hekid am hab chuꞌig g muhkig t-wehhejed mamt wa hab masma hab juh g Jesus. K hab masma am tasho e neid g Jesus doakag am t-doakag ed.
<sax> While we live we are always under the threat of death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus may be revealed in our mortal bodies. ||| T-doakag oidch o am hab chuꞌig mattp hems wo t-muhkid am wehhejed g Jesus. K hab wa masma ab e chehgidch g Jesus doakag id amjed t-chuhkug mo am him muhkig wui.
<sax> As a result, we are facing death so that you may have life! ||| S-ni-mukimakam o chum hekid am hab chuꞌig nani pi am hab junihim ihda chikpan. K am wa s-apꞌe namt pi id hekaj ab bei g wechij doakag.
<sax> These trivial troubles we have only last for a little while, but they produce for us an ever-increasing degree of glory. ||| Hebaichujj ach hab hi wa elid mo shaꞌi si geꞌej g t‑kudutadag iia. K wabshaba heg ab wui t‑uꞌa g woho si geꞌe apꞌechudaj g Jiosh. Heg eda at g Jiosh chum hekid ab wo si has t‑elidad. T pi an hu wo haꞌichugk g jewed t ab t‑kudutadag.
<sax> We don't concern ourselves with what can be seen, for we look forward to what can't be seen. What we see is temporary, but what we can't see is eternal. ||| Ab ach wui t‑gewpkadch hegai apꞌedag, chum achs hi wa chum pi neid g t‑wuhpuikaj. Hegai mach haschu i neid hemu at wabsh wo huhug. T wabshaba pi hekid wo huhug hegai mach am wui t‑gewpkadch.
<sax> We know that when this earthly “tent” we live in is taken down, we have a house prepared by God, not made by human hands. It is eternal and is in heaven. ||| Ihda t‑chuhkug o heg wa wepo mo d wabsh uhksha nat pi wabsh wo e padch. Kutt wabshaba wo edgidad g baꞌich i s‑kehg honshpadag an dahm kahchim ch ed. T id g Jiosh hab wo t‑juni. Kut hab wo masmak mo g si s‑kehg kih ch pi hekid wo e padch.
<sax> We sigh with longing for this, wanting so badly to be clothed with this new heavenly home.  When we put on this clothing we won't be seen naked. ||| Hebaichujj ach si i shahshani nach pi am chum s‑hihimimk dahm kahchim wui ch s‑behimk hegai s‑kehg honshpadag mat g Jiosh ab wo t‑mah.
<sax> While we are in this “tent” we sigh, being weighed down by this life. It's not so much that we want to take off the clothing of this life but that we look forward to what we shall be clothed with, so that what is mortal may be overwhelmed by life. ||| Pi ach hab ahgch shahshani machs im hu hab i s‑junimk ihda t‑honshpadag ch wabshaba hab ahgch matt oi ab wo bei hegai wechij t‑honshpadag an dahm kahchim ch ed k pi d haha wo mukimkamk.
<sax> It's God himself who prepared us for all this, and who provided the Spirit as a guarantee to us. ||| Jiosh at am i t‑apꞌech id wehhejed k ab t‑mah g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag mat wo t‑wehmajk ch am wo i wohokamch mo haschu ab t‑makiog.
<sax> So we remain confident, knowing that while we are at home here in our physical bodies, we are away from the Lord. ||| Pegih, si ach s‑ap t‑tahtk ch ia chewed,
<sax> (For we live by trusting in God, not by seeing him). ||| chum achs pi neid g t‑kownalig Jesus, nach pi ab s‑wohochud ch hab s‑ap himchud g t‑doakag.
<sax> For all of us must appear before Christ's seat of judgment. Each of us will receive what we deserve for what we have done in this life, whether it is good or bad. ||| Wehsijj att hemho wa am wo i t‑chehgi Christ wui mat am wo t‑aꞌappem k ab wo i t‑mahkhi g t‑namkidadag mattp has i masma s‑ap hab junihim o pi ap hab junihim hegai chikpan mo ab t‑mahkch iia.
<sax> Knowing how we are in awe of the Lord, we try to convince others. It's clear to God what we are, and I hope that it's clear to your minds too. ||| S‑toꞌo ehbidam hab mahs g Jiosh lodaita. Kuni heg hekaj ab si i ha chehani g hemajkam mat wo hiwigi mat g Jiosh am wo i ha apꞌech e tahgio. S‑mahch o g Jiosh mo id d wohokam mani em‑ahgid. Kuni hab chum em‑elid mam ahpim hab waꞌap s‑mahch.
<sax> We are not trying to speak well of ourselves again, just trying to give you the opportunity to be proud of us, so you can answer those who are proud of outward show and not what they are inside. ||| Pi ani hejel chum ni‑haꞌichuchud. K wabshaba muꞌijj ab si has ha elid hegam mo si s‑kehg hab mahs pi shaꞌi mahchk g ha‑iꞌibdag. Kuni am haꞌichu em‑ahgid mamt hekaj wo e nakog k ab wo uhpam i nodagi g ha‑neꞌoki.
<sax> If we are “crazy people,” it's for God. If we make good sense, it's for you. ||| Haꞌi ash hab ni‑elid mani ge pi ni‑mahch ch hab ni‑junihim. Ni eda wabsh s‑gewkam am hab junihim g Jiosh tatchui. Kum ahpim s‑mahch mani s‑ni‑tahtk ch am hab ni‑junihim em‑wehhejed.
<sax> Christ's love urges us on, because we're absolutely sure that he died for everyone, and so everyone died. ||| E at muhkid g Christ wehs t‑wehhejed no pi ab si t‑tatchua. Kuch hekaj ab aigo si tatchua ch hemho wa am hab s‑junimk g tatchuij. Id o heg wa wepo matt ahchim wehmaj koi
<sax> Christ died for everyone so that they shouldn't live any longer for themselves, but for him who died and rose again for them. ||| nach pi hahawa pi am hu hab junimk g hejel t‑tatchui ch wabshaba heg tatchui am hab s‑junimk mat e muhkid k ep e chegito k i wuhsh t‑wehhejed.
<sax> From now on we don't look at anyone from a human point of view. Even though we once viewed Christ this way, we don't do so any longer. ||| Heki ani hu wa hab ni‑elid mani s‑mahch mo has chuꞌig g hemajkam ch s‑mahch mat has wo chum chuꞌigkad hegai mat d wo Jiosh si Kehshak. Ni wabshaba hemuch id s‑mahchimk ab amjed g Jiosh.
<sax> That's why anyone who is in Christ is a new being—what was old is gone, the new has come! ||| Do si wechij doakam matp hedai ab i e hemakoj g Christ wehm. Im at hu hab i e juh g hekiukam haꞌichu. T g wechij haꞌichu ab i wuhsh.
<sax> So we are ambassadors for Christ, as though God is pleading through us: “Please, won't you come back and be God's friend?” ||| Neh, kuch si s‑hemajim ab em‑waid am wehhejed g Christ mamt ab wo i hiwigi g Jiosh mat am gawul wo i em‑juh mamt hahawa pi d wo obgajk.
<sax> God made Jesus, who never personally sinned, experience the consequences of sin so that we could have a character that is right as God is right. ||| Wehs at ab abch g e‑alidag g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig mat heg hekaj ab wo t‑abch g Christ s‑apꞌekam ahchim matt ab wo i s‑wohoch.
<sax> As workers together with God we also plead with you not to make your acceptance of God's grace worthless.  Just as God said, “At the right time I heard you, and on the day of salvation I rescued you.”  Believe me: now is the right time! Now is the day of salvation! ||| Bo chuꞌig an Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana ed mo hab kaij g Jiosh:
<sax> I've been speaking bluntly, my Corinthian friends, loving you with a big heart! ||| Neh, id ani wehs ahg si ni‑ihbdag amjed nani pi ab si em‑tatchua.
<sax> We haven't kept our love from you, but you have kept your love from us. ||| Pi ani d ahni manis pi ab hu em‑tatchua. Dam ahpim haꞌi mam pi ab hu ni‑tatchua.

<sax> Don't join together with people who don't believe—for what connection does goodness have with wickedness? What do light and darkness have in common? ||| Pi g ab hu wabsh wo si e behꞌi ha ab hegam mo pi ab hu ihm g Jesus Christ. Shaht hig masma g s‑apꞌekam ab wo e wehnadk g pi apꞌekam? Shaht masma g tonlig ab wo e wehnadk g s‑chuhugam.

<sax> Please make room in your hearts for us! We haven't done anyone wrong, we haven't corrupted anyone, and we haven't taken advantage of anyone. ||| Ab g wo si i s‑ni‑hoꞌigeꞌelid. Pi ant hedai shaꞌi s‑koꞌokam has juh manis has i masma ha iattogid o manis haschukaj i ha padch o manis haschu i ha ehs.
<sax> I'm not saying this to condemn you—as I already told you, you mean so much to us that we live and die together with you! ||| Pi ani heg hekaj hab kaij ihda manis ab haꞌichu em‑abchud. Am am wa s‑mahch mani ab si em‑tatchua. Kut pi haꞌichu wo shaꞌi i t‑gawulkai, chum hems g muhkig.
<sax> I speak up very strongly for you because I am so proud of you. You are such an encouragement to me. I am so happy for you despite all our troubles. ||| Ab ani si has em‑elid ch ab si em‑hiwig ch si s‑hehgig ch am si i ni‑gewkaj, chum as muꞌi haꞌichu t‑kudut.
<sax> When we arrived in Macedonia we didn't have a minute's peace. We were attacked from every direction, with external conflicts and inner fears. ||| Wehsko o wa an hab chuꞌig g kudutadag mant eda am jiwia Macedonia jewed ch ed. Muꞌijj o wa ni‑kawhain. Kuni wa am ni‑kudut nani ge s‑mahch mam has masma hab e junihim.
<sax> Even so, God who encourages the downhearted, encouraged us with Titus' arrival. ||| K wabshaba g Jiosh chum hekid ab t‑mahk g gewkemhuna mach eda t‑kudut. Kunt wa ab i ni‑gewkemhu mat am ni‑nam g Titus.
<sax> Not just by his arrival, but also by the encouragement you gave him. He told us how you were longing to see me, how sorry you were, and how concerned you were about me, which made me even happier. ||| Heg o si s‑ap e tahtk ch am ni‑ahgid mamsh chum si s‑ni‑neidamk ch si pi ap e tahtk heg hekaj mat haschu has e juh am em‑shahgid. K hab kaij mamsh ab ha wui gegok hegam mo has ni‑ahg. Kuni hekaj baꞌich i si s‑hehgig hemuch.
<sax> Even though I made you sorry by the letter I wrote, I don't regret it—though I did regret it because the letter did hurt you, but just for a while.  I'm happy now, not for hurting you, but because this pain led you to change your minds. You were made sorry in a way God would want, and so weren't harmed by us in any way. ||| Si amsh pi ap e tahtk am neꞌokchulidk g ni‑oꞌohana. Kuni wa chum pi hohhoꞌid mant heg am em‑oꞌohani.

<sax> The kind of sorrow God wants us to have makes us change our minds and brings salvation. This kind of sorrow leaves no sense of regret, but worldly sorrow brings death. ||| Bo wa masma hekaj g Jiosh g pi ap tahhadkam am t‑doakag ed matt gam hu wo s‑ohhod g pi ap t‑chegitoi k wo bei g s‑ap tahhadkam.

<sax> We are so encouraged by this. Added to our own encouragement, we were so pleased to see how happy Titus was, because you set his mind at rest. ||| Kuch ab i t‑gewkemhun mamtsh ab bei g i wehmta.
<sax> I boasted to him about you, and you didn't let me down. Just as all I've told you is true, my boasting about you to Titus has proved to be true too! ||| nant pi si s‑ap has em‑ah ab wui. Kumt pi si ni‑edawua. Chum ach hekid g wohokam ahg ab em‑wui. Kut hab waꞌap am e wohokamch hegai mant am ahgi g Titus ab em‑amjed.

<sax> I am so happy that I can be completely confident of you. ||| Si am s‑ap hab junihim hegai mani has i kaij. Kuni heg hekaj ab si em‑hiwig ch si s‑hehgig.
<sax> Brothers and sisters, we want to let you know about the grace of God shown to the Macedonian churches. ||| Neh, t‑wepnag, am ach s‑em‑ahgidamk mat haschu wa hab juh g Jiosh am ha shahgid g wohochuddam amai Macedonia jewed t am.
<sax> Even though they have suffered terrible trouble, they are overflowing with happiness; and even though they are very poor, they are also overflowing in their generosity. ||| Muꞌi shoꞌigdag at nakog k wabshaba wabsh si s‑hehgig ch si s‑ap e tahtk ch am hab wua g mahkig mo eda d wa chum si shoꞌigkam.
<sax> I can confirm that they gave what they could, in fact even more than that! By their own choice ||| Bat juh ihda mahkig mat heꞌes i e nako, pej baꞌich i mo heꞌes i chum e nakog, wabsh hejel hab e elidk.
<sax> they kept on pleading with us to have a part in this privilege of sharing in this ministry to God's people. ||| Ab at si t‑tai matt wo ha hiwigi mat hab wo juh ihda k hab masma am wo i ha wehmt hegam mo d Jiosh hemajkamga ch si e shoꞌigchud amai Judea t am.
<sax> Since you have an abundance of everything—your trust in God, your eloquence, your spiritual knowledge, your complete dedication, and in your love for us—make sure that your abundance also extends to this gracious ministry of giving. ||| Si am geꞌe haꞌichu ab apꞌedag ch ab si s‑wohochud g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch haꞌichu s‑mahch ab amjed g Jiosh ch s‑kehg neneok ch s‑wapagima ch ab si t‑tatchua.

<sax> I'm not ordering you to do this, but to prove how sincere your love is in comparison with the dedication of others. ||| Pi ani ab hu s‑gewkam em‑chehani mamt hab wo juh ihda.

<sax> For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Even though he was rich, he became poor for you, so that through his poverty you could become rich. ||| Am am wa s‑mahch mat has masma am chehgi g e‑hemajimatalig g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ.

<sax> This is my advice: it would be good if you finished what you started. Last year you were not only the first to give but the first to want to do so. ||| Bani masma hab elid ihda mamt am wo i nahto hegai mamt wa am hab i chum juh haꞌakid.

<sax> Now finish what you planned to do. Be as keen to finish as you were to plan, and give as you are able. ||| Pegih, am g wo i e gewpkad k wo nahto. Bamt wa masma s‑wapagimam am wo i nahto mamt wa ged hu i wehpeg hab e juh.
<sax> If the willingness is there, it's fine to give what you have, not what you don't have! ||| Mt wo s‑ap e taht k am hab wo juh mamt heꞌes wo i e nako. T g Jiosh wo wa s‑hohhoꞌi.
<sax> This is not to make things easier for others and harder for you, but simply to be fair.  At the moment you have more than enough and can meet their needs, and in turn when they have more than enough they can meet your needs. In that way everyone is treated fairly. ||| Pi ani hab ahg mams ahpim wo e shoꞌigch am i ha wehmajch hegam wohochuddam mo e shoꞌigchud. Idani am haꞌichu s‑edgid ch hekaj wo i ha wehmt. T hegam am epai wo i em‑wehmt mamtp hekid wo i tatchua g i wehmta. Bamt masma am aꞌai wo i e wehmt mamt hekid wo i tatchua g i wehmta.
<sax> As Scripture says, “The one who had much didn't have any excess, and the one who didn't have much didn't have too little.” ||| Bat masma hab wo e juh hegai mo an hab chuꞌig Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana ed ch hab chuꞌig:
<sax> We're also sending with him a brother who is praised by all the churches for his work in spreading the good news. ||| Am ani hema ep ahgid mat wo oi g Titus. Id o s‑ap ahgachug g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh. K heg hekaj wehsko ab si has elid g t‑wepnag.
<sax> He was also appointed by the churches to go with us as we deliver this gracious offering we're carrying. We do this to honor the Lord and to show our eagerness to help others.  We want to guard against anyone criticizing us about how we use this gift.  We're concerned to do things the right way, not only in the eyes of the Lord, but also in the eyes of everyone. ||| K id d ha‑kehsha mat wo t‑oi matt am wo i ui g em‑mahkig ha wui hegam mach am i s‑ha wehmtamk. Si ach s‑t‑nenꞌoid matt s‑ap hab wo juh ihda em‑wehhejed. T hab pi hedai has wo t‑ahg k wabshaba ab wo has elidad g Jiosh.
<sax> We're also sending with them another brother who has proved to be reliable on many occasions, and who is eager to help. He is now even more eager to help because of the great confidence he has in you. ||| Pegih, t am wo oi g Titus ihda t‑wehnag. Muꞌikko att am aꞌappe ab tahnich mat am wo i t‑wehmt. Kuki chum hekid s‑t‑wehmtamk, wahm hemuch no pi ab si has em‑elid.
<sax> If anyone asks about Titus, he is my companion. He works with me on your behalf. The other brothers are representatives from the churches and an honor to Christ. ||| Kum s‑mahch mo g Titus d ni‑wehm chikpandam ch am wo i em‑wehmt. K idam haꞌi mat am wehmaj wo hihi am d ha‑chuhchai g t‑wepnag ch ab si haꞌichuchud g Christ.
<sax> So please welcome them before all the churches and show them your love, proving how rightly proud we are of you. ||| Ab ani si s‑ap has em‑ahg am ha tahgio. Kumt am wo ha chehgi mam ab si ha tatchua. T hegam mat am i ha chuhcha wo s‑mahchk mani g wohokam am ha ahgid.
<sax> I really don't need to write to you about this offering for God's people.  I know how keen you are to help—I was boasting about this to those in Macedonia that you in Achaia have been ready for over a year, and your enthusiasm has encouraged many of them to give. ||| S‑mahch ani mam tatchua mamt wo i ha wehmt g shoꞌigkam e‑wepnag, chum anis hems pi am hu wo em‑oꞌohani heg amjed. Ia ani wa heki hu si s‑ap has em‑ahg ha wui idam t‑wepnag am ha ahgidch mamt heki hu hab i e ah haꞌakid mamt am wo i ha wehmt hegam shoꞌigkam. Id at muꞌijj am si i ha gewpkai.
<sax> But I'm sending these brothers so that my boasting about you regarding this won't be proved wrong, and that you're prepared, just as I said you would be. ||| Kuni idani am ha ahgid idam t‑wepnag mat am wo hihi em‑wui. Mt wo si e nahtokch heg hekaj e‑mahkig. Kut pi wabsh wo heki e wua g s‑kehg ni‑neꞌoki ab em‑amjed.
<sax> This is just in case some Macedonians should come with me and find you unprepared. We, not to mention you, would be really embarrassed if this project failed! ||| Tp hems wo haꞌi t‑wehmajk g Macedonia t am hemajkam. Kunt wo si ni‑el mamtp pi wo e nahtokch mani eda si s‑ap em‑ahg am ha wui. Mt ahpim hab waꞌap wo si e el.
<sax> Everybody should give as they've already decided—not reluctantly, or because they have to, for God loves those who give with a cheerful spirit. ||| Mt wabshaba hejel hab wo e ah mamt heꞌekia ab wo i ha mah. Pi o ab hu t‑chehani g Jiosh machs ab haꞌichu wo ha mah no pi s‑hohhoꞌid matt si s‑ap t‑taht k am hab wo juh g t‑mahkig k pi wo ge s‑daꞌad.
<sax> God is able to graciously provide you with everything, so that you will always have all you need—with plenty to help others too. ||| Jiosh at wo e nako mat ab wo em‑mah hegai mam haschu i tatchua. Kumt chum hekid wo edgidad mam haschu i tatchua hejel e wehhejed ch am dahm ep wo edgidad mamt am hab wo juh g i wehmta.
<sax> As Scripture says, “He gives generously to the poor; his generosity is everlasting.” ||| Neh, bo chuꞌig an Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana ed:
<sax> This is me Paul, personally appealing to you through Christ's kindness and gentleness, the one who is “shy” when I have to face you but who is “bold” when I'm not there. ||| Haꞌijj amsh hab kaij manish s‑em‑kehꞌid wabsh em‑oꞌohanidch ch antsh ep wo s‑hemajimak am ep jiwiak. Pegih, bani wa masma chum si s‑hemajima mo g Christ.
<sax> I'm pleading with you, so that the next time I'm with you I won't have to be as tough as I think I'll have to be, boldly dealing with those who think we behave in worldly ways. ||| Am g wabsh wo s‑dodolimak. Nt hab pi wo em‑kehꞌel am jiwiak.
<sax> Even though we live in this world, we don't fight as the world does. ||| In ach d dodakam jewed dahm ch wabshaba pi hab masma hab t‑junihim mo hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh.
<sax> Our weapons are not of this world but God's mighty power that destroys fortresses of human thinking, demolishing misleading theories.  Every high wall that stands tall and proud against the knowledge of God is knocked down. Every rebel idea is captured and brought into obedient agreement with Christ. ||| Hegam o ab wui gegok g Jiosh ch ha iattogid ch ab si haꞌichuchud g hejel haꞌichu e‑mahchig. K wabshaba ahchim ab t‑mahkch g Jiosh g gewkdag. Kuch heg gewkdagkaj wehs gewito ihda pi apꞌekam ch pi g hejel t‑gewkdagkaj.
<sax> When you are completely obeying Christ then we're ready to punish any disobedience. ||| Pegih, am amt wo i e chehgi mam am wehs e dagitokch id eda Christ himdag. Nt haha wo s‑koꞌokam ha namkid hegam mo am wa haꞌichukaj pi am hu wehs i e dagitokch.
<sax> I'm not trying to scare you by my letters. ||| Pi ani hab ahgch am em‑oꞌohanid manis wo em‑tods.
<sax> People say, “His letters are tough and severe, but in person he's feeble, and he's a useless speaker.” ||| Tp hems hema hab wo chei, “Paul o si s‑ta keꞌidam kaij ab t‑oꞌohanidch ch wabshaba ia t‑wui jijiwhia ch pi gewkdag. K g neꞌokij d wabsh pi haꞌichu.”
<sax> People like that should realize that what we <span class="it">say</span> through letters when we're not there we will <span class="it">do</span> when we are there! ||| T eda hegai mat hab wo wa chei wo chum s‑mahchk mant hab wa masma hab wo chei hekid am em‑wehmajkch mani has i kaij am ni‑oꞌohana ed.
<sax> I hope you can put up with a little more foolishness from me—well you already do put up with me!  I agonize over you with a divine kind of jealousy, for I promised you to a single husband—Christ—so that I could present you as a pure virgin to him. ||| Pi o hab chum chuꞌig manis hab masma hejel ni‑wehhejed wo neokad. Kuni eda ab si em‑tatchua am wehhejed g Christ. Kumt hekaj ab wo ni‑kaiha. Bam sha masma mam d hohntaj. Kuni si s‑em‑daꞌa hab masma mo g Jiosh mamt wo si e nuhkud g Christ wehhejed.
<sax> I worry that in some way, just as the serpent deceived Eve with his devious cunning, that you might be led astray in your thinking from your sincere and pure commitment to Christ. ||| Am g wo s‑chegitok matsh wa pi wohoch g Jiosh hegai wehpeg uwi mash hab chehgig Eve. Jiawul atsh wa s‑aꞌagi iattogi am gahi wuhshanim g wamad. Kuni s‑gihug mat hab waꞌap wo em‑juh am gahi ha wuhshanim hegam mash chum em‑iattogid. Kumtp hems wo s‑ohhod g Christ
<sax> If anyone comes and tells you about a different Jesus to the one we shared with you, you easily go along with them, accepting a different spirit to the one you received, and a different kind of good news to the one you believed. ||| namsh pi ha hiwgid ch ab ha kaiham. Ab ani em‑ahgid hegai mo haschu am i ni‑tashogid g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ab amjed g Christ. Kumsh eda haꞌi ab ha kaiham hegam mash gawul haꞌichu am em‑ahgid ab amjed.
<sax> I don't believe I'm inferior to these “super-apostles.” ||| Idam amsh haꞌi ab si has ha elid hab masma mo d Christ chuhchai. Ni eda ahni hig woho d kehshaj.
<sax> Even though I may not be skilled in giving speeches, I do know what I'm talking about. We have made this absolutely clear to you in every way. ||| M o hi wa woho mani pi am hu i si s‑mahch g amogida. Kuni wabshaba s‑mahch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch am em‑wui i tashogid.
<sax> This is as certain as the truth of Christ that is in me: nobody in all Achaia will stop me boasting about this! ||| Am ani em‑ahgid wehsko Greece jewed ch ed mant pi wo em‑hiwigi mams ab wo ni‑namkid mani eda am ahgachug g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga em‑shahgid.
<sax> And why? Because I don't love you? God knows that I do! ||| Pi ani heg hekaj hab kaij ihda manis pi ab hu em‑tatchua. Jiosh o s‑mahch mani ab si em‑tatchua.
<sax> I'll continue to do what I've always done, so as to remove any opportunity for those who want to boast that their work is the same as ours. ||| K wabshaba haꞌi hab chum kaij mash hab masma chikpan mani ahni. Ni eda ahni pi haꞌichu em‑kowlant. K idam hi em‑kowlant ch hab em‑iattogid. Am ash chum ni‑wepo e wua ahni mani d Christ kehsha. Pegih, t hemho wa wo chum ahgad g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga pi ab hu haꞌichu em‑kowlantch.
<sax> These people are false apostles, dishonest workers, who pretend to be apostles of Christ. ||| K wabshaba pi d wohokam Christ chuhchai ch haꞌichu ha iattogid ch chum t‑wepo e wua ahchim mach d si s‑wohom Christ chuhchai.
<sax> Don't be surprised at this for even Satan himself pretends to be an angel of light.  So it's no wonder then if those who serve him pretend to be agents of good. But their final end will be in accordance with what they've done. ||| Am o wa tasho mat hab masma hab wo e wuad no pi d Jiawul pionag. Jiawul o chum e wepogid g s‑apꞌekam anghil. T g piongaj hab waꞌap wo e wepogidad ahchim mach am ahgachug g s‑apꞌekam. T wabshaba g Jiosh s‑koꞌokam wo ha namkid heg hekaj.
<sax> Let me say it again: please don't think I'm being foolish. However, even if you do, accept me as someone who is foolish, and let me also boast a little. ||| Haꞌi amsh hab ni‑elid mani wabsh pehegi neok. Nt eda am wo em‑ahgi g wohokam ab amjed g ni‑chikpan. Ab g wo kaiham mant has wo chei.
<sax> What I'm saying is not as the Lord would say it—all this foolish boasting. ||| Pi o ab hu ni‑chehani g t‑kownalig Jesus mant hab kaidam wo neokad.
<sax> But since many others are boasting in the way the world does, let me boast too. ||| Nt wabshaba am hab wo ni‑juh no pi muꞌijj wabsh hejel si e haschud.
<sax> I'm so sorry that we were too weak to do anything like that! But whatever people dare to boast about, I dare to do too. (Here I'm talking like a fool again). ||| Haꞌi ash hab ni‑elid mani pi hab masma ab em‑wui mo hegam nani pi si ni‑elid. Pegih, woho o wa mant wo si ni‑el mantp hab wo masmak. Hegam o si e haschud ch e wehhejed neneok. Pegih, nt ahni hab waꞌap ni‑wehhejed wo neo.
<sax> Are they Hebrews? Me too. Are they Israelites? Me too. Are they descendants of Abraham? Me too. ||| Neh, bash e aꞌaga mash d Tutuligo ch d Jiosh hemajkamga ch d Abrahambad amjedkam. Pegih, ahni ehp.
<sax> Are they servants of Christ? (This will sound like I'm talking crazy). But I have done so much more. I've worked harder, been imprisoned more often, whipped more times than I can count, faced death time and again. ||| Bo kaij mo d Christ pionag. Nt ahni hab wo chei mani baꞌich d i si piongaj mo hegam, chum ams hab wo ni‑elidad mani wabsh pehegi neok. Baꞌich ani i si s‑gewkam chikpan ch baꞌich i muꞌikko ni‑kuhpach g Christ wehhejed. Baꞌich amt i muꞌikko ni‑gewitta. Muꞌikko ant chum alo muh.
<sax> Five times I received from the Jews the forty lashes less one. ||| Hetaspo at am hugkam ab ni‑chuꞌijigch g ni‑wehm Tutuligo mat waikko gamai humukto ni‑gewitta.
<sax> Three times I was beaten with rods, once I was stoned, three times I was shipwrecked. Once I spent twenty-four hours adrift on the ocean. ||| Waikko at ni‑gewitta g Rome t am hahaꞌichu. Hemho amt ni‑maꞌichkwua. Waikko at wachum g wahlko mani an eda. Kuni hemako tash ch hemako chuhug chehmoꞌim am wiꞌinoghim shuhdagi ch ed.
<sax> During my many journeys I have faced the dangers of crossing rivers, robber gangs, attacks from my own countrymen, as well as from foreigners. I have faced danger in cities, in the deserts, and on the sea. I have faced the danger of people who pretend to be Christians. ||| S‑to o ehbidama am ni‑wehhejed mani hebai i oimmed. An o hab chuꞌig g wiꞌindag ch muꞌij g s‑chu eꞌeskam. Haꞌijj o s‑ta ehbidam s‑ni‑kehꞌid g ni‑wehm oꞌodham ch gawul mahs oꞌodham.

<sax> I have faced hard labor and struggles, many sleepless nights, hungry and thirsty, often going without food, cold, without enough clothing to keep warm. ||| Muꞌikko ant si gewko k pi ha kohsig ch hebai d bihugimkam ch tonomkam. Muꞌikko ani pi ha haꞌichu hugi ch pi ha kih ch s‑wihonagi eniga.
<sax> Besides all this, I face the daily concerns of dealing with all the churches. ||| Am baꞌich ehp mani wehs tashkaj si ha chegitok hegam mo ab ihm g Christ ch an aꞌai hab chuꞌig.
<sax> The God and Father of the Lord Jesus—may he be praised forever—knows I am not lying. ||| Jiosh alidag o d ni‑kownalig. K g Jiosh s‑mahch mo wehs woho ihda mani em‑ahgid. Kunt chum hekid ab wo si hehgchulidad.
<sax> While I was in Damascus, the governor under King Aretas had the city guarded in order to capture me. ||| Neh, hegai kownal mo ab wecho g geꞌe kownal Aretas at wa am i ha chuhcha g shondal ab Damascus kihhim kihjeg t ab mat an wo ni‑be k wo ni‑kuh.
<sax> But I was lowered in a basket from a window in the city wall, and so I escaped from him. ||| Mt wabshaba an ni‑dai washomi ch ed k ab i ni‑huduni hodai kolhai amjed. Nt hab hi wa al masma ni‑doꞌibia.
<sax> I suppose I have to boast, even though it doesn't really help. Let me go on to visions and revelations from the Lord. ||| Pi at haꞌichu wo ni‑apꞌet manis wo em‑ahgi hegai mani haschu am hab junihim. Heg ant wo waꞌi em‑ahgi mat haschu g Jiosh am ni‑chehgi.
<sax> I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was taken up to the third heaven (whether physically in the body, or out of it, I don't know, but God knows).  I know that this man (whether taken up physically in the body, or apart from it, I don't know, but God knows), ||| Heg at am uhgk i ni‑bei e‑kihdag wui an dahm kahchim ch ed.

Heg ani hi wa s‑mahch mant an i ni‑nei Jiosh kihdag ed.
<sax> how he was taken up into Paradise, and heard things too wonderful to be spoken, in words so sacred that no human being is allowed to say. ||| An ant s‑ta kakaim haꞌichu kah. K g Jiosh pi ni‑hiwgid manis am wo ah.
<sax> Something like that I'll boast about, but I won't boast about myself, except for my weaknesses. ||| Id ant ab wo si has ah mat g Jiosh am ni‑chehgi k pi ahni ab hu hejel has wo ni‑ah. Jiosh o ab ni‑chehgidch g e‑gewkdag nani pi d wabsh shoꞌig pi gewkam hemajkam.
<sax> I wouldn't be foolish if I wanted to boast, because I'd be telling the truth. But I won't boast, so that nobody will think more of me than what they see me doing or hear me saying. ||| Kuni muꞌi haꞌichu hab wua heg hekaj gewkdaj ch wabshaba pi em‑ahgid nani pi pi tatchua mas hedai ab hu wo si has ni‑elidad heg hekaj. Heg amt waꞌi hekaj ab wo si has ni‑elidad mam haschu i neid mani hab wua ch haschu i kah mani hab kaij.
<sax> But he told me, “My grace is all you will need, for my power is effective in weakness.” That's why I happily boast about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may reside in me. ||| Kut hab masma i nodagi g e‑neꞌoki, “Baꞌich at i s‑ap wo e chehgi g ni‑gewkdag ab m‑ab mapt wabsh s‑ap wo nakogad g e‑shoꞌigdag napt pi pi wo e nako maps hejel wo nako. Heg waꞌi ni‑gewkdagkaj apt wo e nako.”
<sax> So I appreciate weaknesses, insults, troubles, persecutions, and difficulties that I suffer for Christ's sake. For when I'm weak, then I'm strong! ||| Heg o am chehgidch g e‑gewkdag am ni‑wehhejed mani hekid i mukialig. Kuni heg hekaj wabsh si s‑ap ni‑tahtk mani mukialig ch ab nakog g s‑koꞌok has ahgadag ch s‑wehch haꞌichu ch shoꞌigchudadag ch kudutadag wehhejed g Christ.
<sax> I'm talking like a fool, but you made me do it! You should really have been speaking well of me, for in no way am I inferior to the super-apostles,  even though I don't count for anything. ||| Ab o em‑ab mamt ni‑wehhejed wo neneokad ab ha wui hegam mash has ni‑ahg am em‑shahgid. Msh wabshaba pi hab e wua. Kunt hemho wa am ni‑wehhejed has wo chei, chum anis pi hohhoꞌid manis hab wo ni‑juh nani pi d wabsh pi haꞌichu.

<sax> Yet the marks of an apostle were patiently demonstrated among you—signs, wonders, and powerful miracles. ||| Bani wa junihim g s‑hasig haꞌichu ch muꞌi haꞌichu ab nakog mani wa eda am ahg g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga em‑wui. K id am chehgidch mani d Christ kehsha.
<sax> In what way were you inferior to the other churches except I wasn't any burden to you? Please forgive me for doing you wrong! ||| S‑ap ani hab ni‑junihim ab em‑wui hab wa masma mani ab wehs ha wui hegam mo an aꞌai d Christ ihmdam, heg hi wa mani pi em‑hiwgid mams ab wo haꞌichu ni‑namkid. Ab g wabsh wo s‑ni‑hoꞌigeꞌid mani pi em‑hiwgid.
<sax> Now I'm preparing to visit you for the third time, and I won't be a burden to you. I don't want what you have, I want you yourselves! After all, children shouldn't save up for their parents, but parents should for their children. ||| Id o d i waikkokam mant am wo i em‑chehgim.

<sax> Well, even if that's so, I wasn't a burden to you. Maybe I was being devious, and tricked you with my cunning ways! ||| S‑mahch am mani pi haꞌichukaj shaꞌi em‑wechun. Kumsh eda haꞌi hab kaij manish wabsh em‑iattogid
<sax> Maybe you're thinking that all along we've been just trying to defend ourselves. No, we speak for Christ before God. Everything we do, friends, is for your benefit. ||| Naꞌams haꞌi hab ni‑elid mani gam hu wabsh chum ni‑oan id hekaj mani wa hab kaij. K eda pi hab chuꞌig. Am ani Jiosh tahgio hab kaij hegai mo d Christ tatchui. K wehs hegai mach haschu hab i junihim d i em‑wehmtadag.
<sax> I do worry when I visit that somehow I won't find you as I would want to, and that you won't find me as you would want to! I'm afraid that there will be arguments, jealousy, anger, rivalry, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorder. ||| S‑gihug ani mant wo cheh am jiwiak mamt gawul wo masmak mani hab masma chum em‑tatchuid.

<sax> I'm afraid that when I visit, my God will humble me in your presence, and that I will be weeping over many of those who have sinned previously, and who still have not repented of impurity, sexual immorality, and indecent acts that they committed. ||| T heg wo ni‑mah g si edadag am Jiosh tahgio.

<sax> Even though he was crucified in weakness, now he lives through the power of God. We too are weak in him, but you will see that we live with him through the power of God. ||| Woho o wa mat e wepogi g shoꞌig pi gewpkam oꞌodham k ab e muhkid kots t ab. T wabshaba g Jiosh am chehgi g e‑gewkdag. K g Christ hahawa ep doakam heg gewkdagkaj.
<sax> Examine yourselves to see if you are trusting God. Put yourselves to the test. Don't you yourselves realize that Jesus Christ is in you? Unless you have failed the test… ||| Am g wo si e mamche k am hejel wo i e aꞌamich mams am hi wa s‑ap hab chuꞌig e‑wohochudadag oidch.

<sax> However, I hope that you realize that we have not failed the test. ||| k hab wa masma wo s‑mahchk mani ahni hab waꞌap woho d wohochuddam.
<sax> We pray to God that you won't do anything bad—not so we can show we passed the test, but so you can do what is good, even if we appear to be failures. ||| Ab ani si ni‑hoꞌigeꞌidahun Jiosh wui mamt pi am hu hab wo junihid g pi apꞌekam ch wabshaba g s‑apꞌekam am hab wo junihid, chum as wo pi ap ni‑ahgad hegam mo s‑ni‑kehꞌid.
<sax> That is why I write about this while I'm not with you, so that when I am with you I won't have to treat you harshly by imposing my authority. The Lord gave me authority for building up, not for tearing down. ||| T‑kownalig Jesus o ab ni‑mahkch g gewkdag mant wo shohbi g pi em‑apꞌekam.

<sax> Finally, brothers and sisters, I say goodbye. Continue to improve spiritually. Encourage one another. Be in agreement. Live in peace, and the God of love and peace will be with you. ||| Pegih, ni‑wepnag, haꞌas ant hab wo chei. Am g wo i e nakogi mamt wehs ab wo i e dagito Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag wui.

<sax> I was delighted to discover that some of your children are following the truth, just as the Father commanded us. ||| Si ani s-ap ni-tahtk ch ia haꞌi ha neid g em-wehm kihkam. K idam an uꞌukch g wohokam hab masma mo ab t-chehani g Jiosh.
<sax> Now I'm telling you, dear lady, not as a new instruction, but following what we've understood from the beginning, that we should love one another. ||| Kuni ab wehs i em-gewkemhun mamt ab aꞌai e wui wo si pihk e elidad. Pi o d wechij chehanig ihda mani am em-ahgid. Edgid ach ihda ged hu i shohshon k amjed.
<sax> This is what love is: we should follow God's commands. The command, just as you heard right from the beginning, is that you should live in love. ||| Kutt ab aꞌai t-wui wo si pihk t-elidad ch hekaj am wo t-chehgidad mach ab s-wohog elid ihda chehanigaj g Jiosh.
<sax> All those who become extremists and don't continue to follow the teaching of Christ don't have God with them. Those who continue to follow the teaching of Christ have both the Father and the Son with them. ||| Hegam matp hedai am gawul wo juh g Jiosh alidag mashchama o pi shaꞌi mahch g Jiosh. S-mahch ach g Jiosh ch ep s-mahch g alidaj ahchim mach am oidch hab masma g alidaj mashchama.
<sax> If people come to you and don't show evidence of Christ's teaching, don't take them in, don't welcome them— ||| Kumt heg hekaj pi ab hu wo ha kaihamad hegai mat hedai wo chum s-em-mashchamam k eda pi wo ahgachugad g Jiosh alidag mashchama.

<sax> for if you encourage them you share in their evil work. ||| mamt pi ab hu wo i ha wehmt hegam mat am wo ahgachugad g pi wohokam.
<sax> I have so many things to tell you that I won't write any more with paper and ink, for I hope to visit you and talk with you face to face. How happy that would make us! ||| Muꞌi ani haꞌichu s-em-ahgidamk ch wabshaba pi id hekaj am i em-oꞌohani nani pi am s-himimk mant wo em-neid k wo em-wehm neo. Kutt am t-wehm si s-ap wo t-tahtkk.
<sax> Greetings to you from the children of your chosen sister. ||| Ia o haꞌi kih g t-wepnag ch ash si pihk e elid em-hekaj.
<sax> May you have ever more grace and peace as you grow in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord. ||| S-mahch am g Jiosh ch ep s-mahch g t-kownalig Jesus. K heg hekaj ab si s-em-hoꞌigeꞌid ch ab baꞌich wo i em-mahkad g s-ap tahhadkam.
<sax> Through his divine power we have been given everything that's important to live a God-centered life. This comes through knowing him who called us to himself by his own glory and goodness. ||| Pegih, s-mahch ach g Jiosh. K heg hekaj ab t-mahkch wehs hegai mach tatchua matt hekaj s-ap wo himchudad g t-doakag ch d wo s-apꞌekamk. Ab at i t-gawulkai ab t-chehgidch g si s-tondam e-gewkdag ch s-e-apꞌekam.
<sax> Through these promises you can share in the divine nature, being rid of the corruption caused by this world's evil desires. ||| Si geꞌe haꞌichu atsh hab wo t-juni g Jiosh. Kumt ab i s-wohochud k hab wo edgidad g Jiosh doakag ch wo e doꞌibia ab amjed hegai pi apꞌekam mo in haꞌichug heg hekaj pi ap ha-tatchui g hemajkam.
<sax> add to reverence, affection for fellow-believers, add to affection for fellow-believers, love. ||| Ab o em-ab mamt ab ep wo si ha tatchuad g e-wehm wohochuddam ch ab wo si pihk e elidad chum hems ha hekaj g hemajkam.
<sax> The more you have these qualities, the more they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. ||| Neh, id amt wehs eda am wo e nakogad ch hekaj s-wapagim am hab wo junihid g tatchuij g t-kownalig Jesus Christ.
<sax> For anyone who doesn't have such qualities is short-sighted, or blind. They forget that they've been cleansed from their past sins. ||| Kutp hedai pi hab wo junihid ihda ch hab wo masmak mo g pi neadam no pi pi ap neid mat gam hu hab i juh g Jiosh g pi ap chuꞌijigaj.
<sax> So, brothers and sisters, be all the more determined to make sure you are truly “called and chosen.” If you do this, you won't ever fall. ||| Neh, mt hekaj am baꞌich wo i si e nako mamt si s-wihnam wo bei hegai mat haschu wehhejed ab i em-waid k ab i em-gawulkai g Jiosh. T hab pi hekid hab wo e juh mams wo i shul ab amjed g Jiosh.
<sax> You will receive a tremendous welcome into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. ||| Jiosh at s-ap ab wo em-mah g apꞌedag mamt am wo i wahp t-doꞌibiakam Jesus Christ kownaltalig ed.
<sax> That's why I always remind you about these things, even though you know them already, and you stand firm in the truth that you possess. ||| Heki amki hu s-mahch ihda mani ia em-ahgid ch s-wihnam gegok heg eda wohokam mamt ab bei. Nt wabshaba am wo i em-chechegitolidad mamt wo s-chegitok ch ab s-ap wo bei g e-apꞌedag.
<sax> But I still think it's a good idea to encourage you by giving you reminders while I live.  I know the time when I shall leave this life will be coming soon— our Lord Jesus Christ has made this clear to me. ||| E o aihim mant im hu hab wo i ni-juh mad hab ni-ahgid g t-kownalig Jesus Christ. Ni hekaj hab ni-ahg mant am wo si em-chechegitolidad wehs ihda am hugkam mant hebai hugkam d wo doakamk.
<sax> I will do my best so that when I'm gone you will always be able to remember these things. ||| Am ant wo i ni-nako mant am wo oꞌoha wehs ihda. Mt hab masma chum hekid wo s-chegitokad am i dahm mant hekid im hu hab wo i ni-juh.
<sax> We ourselves heard this voice speak from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain. ||| Id achd kah mo ab neok dahm kahchim t amjed anai machd an wehmaj doꞌag dahm.
<sax> We also have the confirming word of prophecy that's absolutely trustworthy, and you will benefit from paying close attention to it. It's like a lamp that shines in a dark place until the day dawns, and the morning star rises in your hearts. ||| Id o am si wohokamchud mo haschu heki hu am ahg g Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam. Haꞌichu ha-ahga o wabsh heꞌes ab i t-mahkch g amichudadag hab sha masma matp hems g kanjel t-tonlidch am s-chuhugam k ed.

Mt heg hekaj wo s-chegitok g haꞌichu ha-ahga g Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam k ab wo e dagitokch Jesus wui.
<sax> Most of all you should realize that no prophecy of scripture is a matter for interpretation based on the whims of an individual,  for no prophecy originated in human ideas, but prophets spoke for God as they were moved by the Holy Spirit. ||| Haꞌichu ha-ahga o pi d wabsh hemajkam haꞌichu ha-ahga. Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag o am ha tashogid g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. T heg hekaj pi hedai wo e nako mas wabsh g hejel e-mahchigkaj wo i tashogi g haꞌichu ha-ahga.
<sax> But just as there were false prophets among the people then, there will be false teachers among you. They subtly introduce false and destructive teachings, even denying the Lord who redeemed them, quickly bringing destruction on themselves. ||| An atsh wa haꞌi i wuwha mash wa e wepogid g Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam ch wabshaba wabsh ha iattogid g hemajkam. Kut hab waꞌap in wo i wuwha em-shahgid hegam mat wo chum em-mashcha g pi wohokam k wo padch g em-wohochudadag. Jesus Christ o d t-doꞌibiakam. K wabshaba idam pi wohokamchud. S-hohtam at im hu hab wo i ha juh g Jiosh mat hekid wo e ai g ha-tashga.
<sax> Many will follow their immoral perversions, and because of them people will condemn the way of truth. ||| Muꞌijj at am ha oidch hab wo junihid g s-bihtagi haꞌichu hab ha-juni. T heg hekaj muꞌi hemajkam wo pad has ahgad g Jesus himdag.
<sax> They will greedily exploit you with false tales. However they are already condemned: their sentence has been hanging over them for a long time, their destruction won't be postponed. ||| Hegam mo em-iattogid ab amjed g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga o wabsh s-uꞌimkch g em-lialiga. K wabshaba am e nahtokch g Jiosh mat wo ha lodait k im hu hab wo i ha juh.
<sax> For God didn't even spare the angels when they sinned. He threw them into Tartarus, holding them in dark pits ready for judgment. ||| Si o tasho mo e aihim g lodaita tash. Haꞌi atsh am shul g anghil pi apꞌekam ch ed. Tsh g Jiosh am ha shul s-chuhugam k ed k am ha uꞌukch mat haha wo ha lodai geꞌe lodaita tash ed.
<sax> God didn't spare the ancient world either, but he protected Noah who told people about the God who did right. He was one of the eight who were saved when God sent a flood upon a world of evil people. ||| Muꞌijj g heki hu hemajkam ash wa pi ab hu wohog elid g Jiosh. Kutsh hab juh g geꞌe wiꞌindag matsh ha wiꞌin. Sh eda am wa chum ahgahim g s-apꞌekam ihda mash hab chehgig Noah. Tsh id doꞌibia g Jiosh ch wewaꞌak ehp g wehmaj kihkam.
<sax> As you can see, the Lord is able to rescue from their troubles those who respect him, and to keep the wicked until the day of judgment when their punishment is completed. ||| Wehs ihda o am t-tashogid mo g Jiosh e nahtokch mat wo ha doꞌibia g s-apꞌekam oꞌodham ab amjed g ha-kudutadag k s-koꞌokam ab wo ha namkid g pi apꞌekam mat wo e ai g geꞌe lodaita tash.
<sax> This is especially so for those who follow their corrupt human desires, and contemptuously disregard authority. Arrogant and proud, they're not even afraid to defame heavenly beings. ||| Jiosh at baꞌich i si s-koꞌokam wo ha namkid hegam mo d wabsh totonto ch pi ap hekaj g e-chuhkug ch pi ab hu wohog elid g t-kownalig Jesus Christ.
<sax> Angels, on the other hand, even though they are stronger and more powerful, don't disparage them before the Lord. ||| Anghil o ha baꞌich i s-gewpkdag ch eda pi shaꞌi koꞌokam ab ha abchud hegam hahaꞌichu am tahgio g Jiosh.
<sax> These people are like mindless beasts, produced like farm animals to be captured and slaughtered. They condemn things they don't know anything about, and just like animals they will be destroyed. ||| K eda hegam s-chu iꞌattomkam pi haꞌichu am hu chegito hab masma mo g mischini haꞌichu doakam ch s-koꞌokam has ahg hegai mo haschu pi amichud. T g Jiosh wo ha hugio hab masma mamtp hems wo mua g haꞌichu doakam.
<sax> They will be paid back in harm for the harm they have done. Their idea of fun is to commit their evil lusts in broad daylight. They are stains and blemishes on your community. They enjoy their deceptive pleasures even while they eat together with you. ||| S-koꞌokam at ab wo bei g e-namkidadag heg hekaj mo am hab junihim g pi apꞌekam. Dash ha-hohhoꞌida mat chum hems tash ed hab wo junihid g si s-uam haꞌichu. Am ash em-wehm e gegosid. K d si edadag mo hab s-junimk g iattogida.
<sax> They're always on the lookout for adulterous relationships—they just can't stop sinning. They seduce the vulnerable; they have trained themselves in greed; they are offspring under a curse. ||| Heg o waꞌi tatchua mat g uꞌuwi an wo ha neidad ch pi ap haꞌichu am wo chegitod. Shahag wepo mo pi ha huhuge g pi ap ha-tatchui. S-uꞌimk o hegai mo pi ab hu d ha-wuikam ch im hu hab pi apko i ha wanimed hegam mo pi gewpkdag. Jiosh o heki hu ab ha mohtoꞌidch g s-koꞌok namkidadag.
<sax> They have abandoned the right path and went astray, following the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved to be paid for doing evil. ||| Heki at hu i e mehkod ab amjed g s-apꞌekam hab masma matsh wa hema hab e juh mash hab chehgig Balaam. Ihda Balaambad ash d chum Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam ch wabshaba s-uꞌimk g lial am hab junihidch g pi apꞌekam.
<sax> But he was told off for his evil actions—a dumb donkey spoke with a human voice and stopped the prophet's foolishness! ||| Tsh g Jiosh shohbi g pi ap haꞌichu hab elidaj am hab juhk g wuhlu shoigaj mat haha wabsh neo.
<sax> They promise them freedom, even though they themselves are slaves to depravity. “You are a slave to whatever conquers you.” ||| no pi am ha ahgid mo wabsh chum haschu s-apꞌe ch eda hejel e wupulshch g pi apꞌekamkaj. Matp haschukaj wo e gewito g oꞌodham k heg hekaj wo e wulshchid.
<sax> If people manage to escape from the evil influence of the world by knowing the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and then get tangled up in sin again and are defeated, they are worse off than they were in the first place. ||| Hegam s-chu iꞌattomkam at s-mai g wohokam ab amjed g t-kownalig Jesus Christ k hekaj wo chum e doꞌibia. Kut heg hekaj baꞌich wo i pi apꞌek mat am ep wo e wupulsh g pi apꞌekamkaj.
<sax> It would have been better not to have known the right way of truth, than to have known it and then turn away from the sacred instructions they'd been given. ||| Ab o ha mahkch g Jiosh g haꞌichu e-ahga. K wabshaba baꞌich i s-apꞌe mat hems pi wo kah matp wabsh gam hu wo s-ohhod.
<sax> This proverb has come true for them: “The dog has returned to its own vomit, and the washed pig has gone back to rolling in the mud.” ||| T am wo e wohokamch ihda hab ha-cheꞌidag:
<sax> My friends, this is my second letter to you. In both of them I've tried to stir you up and remind you to think clearly with pure minds. ||| Pegih neh, ni‑wepnag, id o d waꞌi gokkokam mant am i em‑oꞌohanid k am i em‑chegitol idam haꞌichu.
<sax> Remember the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets, and what the Lord and Savior commanded through your apostles. ||| Chum ani si em‑tatchuid mamt wo s‑chegitok g haꞌichu ha‑ahga g Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam ch ep wo s‑chegitok hegai chehanigaj g t‑doꞌibiakam kownal Jesus mo g am chuhchaij am wa em‑ahgid.
<sax> Above all you should know that derisive people will come in the last days, full of mockery and following their own evil desires. ||| Mt wo s‑mahchkad mat am wo i e aihi mat ep wo jiwia g Jesus, t an haꞌi wo i wuwha mo heg waꞌi hejel e‑tatchui am hab s‑junimk. Idam at wo has em‑ahgad
<sax> “So what happened to this coming he promised?” they ask. “Right from the time our ancestors died, everything's continued as it always has, ever since creation began.” ||| ch pi ab hu has wo elidad g wohokam ch hab wo kaijjid, “Mki wabsh hejel e iattogid mam hab chechꞌe matsh ep wo uhpam jiwia g Jesus. T eda pi jiwia. T muꞌijj heki hu waꞌi koi g t‑shohshon. Wehs haꞌichu o am hab wabsh i e junihim mo has i e junihim ga hu hebai i amjed mashp hekid in i e nahto g jewed.”
<sax> But by means of that same divine command the heavens and the earth that now exist are reserved for destruction by fire at the day of judgment when the wicked will be destroyed. ||| K hab wa masma wabsh g e‑neꞌokikaj an uꞌukch g Jiosh g dahm kahchim ch jewed ch ab wo ai mat wo ha lodai g pi ap hemajkam k im hu hab wo i ha juh mei ch ed.
<sax> However, my friends, don't forget this one thing: that for the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years is like a day. ||| Id amt ep wo s‑chegitok mo g mihl aꞌahidag hab waꞌi masma mo g hemako tash am wehhejed g Jiosh.
<sax> The Lord is not delaying the fulfillment of his promise, as some define delay, but he is being very patient with you. He doesn't want anyone to be lost, but everyone to come and repent. ||| K wabshaba am hemajkam t‑wehhejed shahag wepo mo si chewaj g tash mat g Jiosh am hab wo juh hegai mash hab s‑t‑junidamk. K eda g Jiosh si s‑ha bahbgi g hemajkam ch ab chum ha nenida no pi pi hab chum shaꞌi elid mas hedai wo huhug am pi apꞌekam ch e d pi gam hu s‑ohhodk g pi ap e‑chegitoi.
<sax> However the day of the Lord will come, unexpectedly like a thief. The heavens will explode with a thunderous roar, and the elements  will be destroyed as they are burned up. The earth and everything in it will vanish. ||| Neh, no hig pi woho mo pi ta machima mas hekid g s‑chu ehskam am wo wah em‑kih ed? Pegih, k hab waꞌap pi ta machima mas hekid ep wo jiwia g t‑kownalig Jesus. S‑hohtam atsh wo jiwia. Kutsh wo si s‑kaidam huhug g dahm kahchim k wo meitto g tash ch huhuꞌu ch jewed.
<sax> Since everything is going to be destroyed in this way, what kind of people should you be? You should be living lives that are pure, dedicated to God, ||| Wehs haꞌichu atsh wo huhug. Mt heg hekaj ab wo chum si i e dagitokch Jiosh wui
<sax> waiting expectantly and being eager for the coming of the day of God. That day the heavens will catch fire and be destroyed, and the elements will melt in the heat. ||| ch ab wo nenidad hegai tash ch am wo e nakogad mat hems s‑hohtam wo e ai.
<sax> But as for us, we are looking for new heavens and a new earth that God has promised where everything is right. ||| Sh wabshaba g Jiosh hab kaij mat heg i dahm am haha wo nahto g wechij dahm kahchim ch wechij jewed. Tsh g s‑apꞌekam an hab wo waꞌi e junihid anai. Neh, id ach ab si nenida.
<sax> So, my friends, since you're anticipating these things, make sure you'll be found pure and blameless, and at peace with God. ||| Pegih oi g wo, tt hig am wo si i t‑nako matt wo si s‑apꞌek am Jiosh tahgio k wo si s‑ap t‑tahtkkad ab aꞌai t‑wui. T g Jiosh s‑ap ab wo t‑neidad.
<sax> My friends, since you already know this, make sure that these errors of the wicked don't lead you astray, and you don't fall from your firm position. ||| Am am wa heki hu s‑mahch wehs ihda, ni‑wepnag. Hegam mat pi ab hu wo wohog elidad g Jiosh at gam hu hab wo i e juh ab amjed. Kumt wo s‑e nenꞌoidad mamt pi am hu ha oidk hab wo e junihid.
<sax> May you grow in the grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. May he have glory, both now and forever! Amen. ||| Am att hig wo i t‑nako matt ab baꞌich wo i mahchid g t‑doꞌibiakam kownal Jesus Christ ch baꞌich wo i bei g i wehmtadag ab amjed. Heg ach ab si hehgchulid ch chum hekid ab wo si ihmad.

<sax> We keep on thanking God for you, brothers and sisters—we just have to! This is the right thing to do because your trust in God is growing in leaps and bounds, and the love you all have for each other increases more and more. ||| Chum ach hekid ab si hoꞌigeꞌid g Jiosh em-hekaj, t-wepnag. Am amsh si i gewkahim e-wohochudadag ed ch baꞌich i si pihk e elid ab aꞌai e wui.
<sax> We speak so proudly of you among the churches of God because of your patient courage and trust in God during all the persecution and trouble you're going through. ||| Kuch heg hekaj si s-ap t-tahtk ch wehsko ha ahgidahim g t-wehm wohochuddam ab em-amjed. Msh am em-shoꞌigchud nam pi ab s-wohochud g Jiosh. Kumsh eda s-ap ab nakog g e-shoꞌigdag am wehhejed g Jiosh.
<sax> For this is evidence that God is right in the decisions he makes, and that you deserve the kingdom of God for which you are suffering. ||| Id o am wohokamchud mat am i em-apꞌech g Jiosh e wehhejed k pi ab hu haꞌichu wo em-abch am lodaita ch ed. Am am e shoꞌigchud wehhejed g Jiosh kownaltalig. K g Jiosh hab em-elid mam d s-apꞌekam ch am wo i em-wahpki e-kihdag ed.
<sax> Since God does what's right he will deal appropriately with those who cause you trouble. ||| Jiosh at s-ap hab wo juh g lodaita. Hegam mo em-shoꞌigchud at wo e shoꞌigch heg hekaj.
<sax> He will free you from your suffering—and us too—when the Lord Jesus appears from heaven in blazing fire with his powerful angels, ||| Kumt ahpim wo e doꞌibia ab amjed g e-shoꞌigchudadag. Jiosh at hab wo juh ihda mat hekid ep wo jiwia g t-kownalig Jesus ab dahm kahchim t amjed. T ia wehmaj wo dada g anghiligaj k wo si s-gewkdagk.
<sax> on the day when he comes to receive glory from his people, admired by all those who trust in him. This includes you because you were convinced about what we told you. ||| Id at hab wo e juh mat hekid ia ep wo jiwia g t-kownalig Jesus. Kut g gewkdaj am haha wo i chehgi mat t-doꞌibia k ab i t-gawulkai e wehhejed.
<sax> That's why we continue to pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of what he's called us to do. May God powerfully fulfill every desire you have to do good and every action that comes from trusting him ||| Pegih, heg ach hekaj chum hekid ab t-hoꞌigeꞌidahun Jiosh wui am em-wehhejed.

<sax> so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be honored by what you do—and in turn you are honored by him through the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ. ||| Kumt ab wo si haꞌichuchudad g t-kownalig Jesus. T heg hab waꞌap ab wo si em-haꞌichuchudad. Jiosh at si s-hemajim am i apꞌech g e-alidag wehm mat id hab wo em-juni.
<sax> Talking about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and how we're brought together to him, brother and sisters— ||| Bach wa em-ahgid mat ep wo jiwia g t-kownalig Jesus Christ k ab e wui wo i t-ui.
<sax> please don't become upset or concerned by any spiritual revelation, or message, or letter supposedly from us that makes you think that the day of the Lord has already come. ||| Kush am hema em-ahgid mat heki hu hab e juh. Pi g am wo shaꞌi e kudut k pi shaꞌi ha wohochud, chum as hems hab wabsh e wua mo heg am ha tashogid g Jiosh o atp hems em-ahgid matt ahchim hab masma haꞌichu oꞌoha.
<sax> Don't let anyone deceive you in any way, because the Rebellion must come first, and the lawless man be revealed, the one whose end is destruction.  He is the enemy of God, and proudly sets himself up over everything that is called God and is worshiped. He even installs himself in God's Temple, claiming to be God. ||| Koi at e ai.

<sax> Don't you remember that I told you all this while I was still with you? ||| Am am wa s-chegito mani wa am wa heki hu em-ahgid ihda mani eda am em-wehmaj.
<sax> Now you know what's keeping him in check, because he will be revealed for what he is at the appropriate time.  For the secret ways of lawlessness  are already at work; however he who now restrains it will continue to do so until he is out of the way. ||| S-mahch am mo g pi apꞌekam an e shohbidch hemu. T wabshaba has tash in hu hab wo i e juh hegai mo an shohbidch.
<sax> But we just have to keep on thanking God for you, brothers and sisters loved by the Lord, because God from the beginning chose you to be saved through the Spirit who makes you right as you trust in the truth.  This is what he called you to through the good news we shared with you, so that you could participate in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ. ||| Mt wabshaba ahpim wo e doꞌibia ab amjed g s-koꞌok e-namkidadag.

<sax> Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God the Father (who through his grace gave us eternal confidence and a trustworthy hope), ||| Ab o t-wui si pihk e elid g t-kownalig Jesus Christ g Jiosh t-ohg wehm ch ab si s-t-hoꞌigeꞌel. Kuch heg hekaj ab wui t-gewpkadch.
<sax> encourage you and strengthen you so you can say and do everything that is good. ||| Ahchim ach ab tahni mat ab wo i em-gewpkadch mamt g s-apꞌekam am hab wo junihid ch hab wo kaijjid.
<sax> Lastly, brothers and sisters, please pray for us, so that the Lord's message may spread and be truly appreciated, just as it is by you— ||| Ab g wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahun, t-wepnag, k ab wo tai g Jiosh mat pi ab hu wo e shohbi g haꞌichu t-ahga ab amjed t-kownalig Jesus. T muꞌijj ab wo si has i elid k ab wo s-wohog el hab masma mo am hab e wua em-shahgid.
<sax> and that we may be kept safe from immoral and evil men, because not everyone trusts in God. ||| Pi ap hehemajkam o pi ab hu wohochud g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch ab t-wui gegok. Kumt am wo si e hoꞌigeꞌidahunad mat wo t-doꞌibia g Jiosh ab ha amjed.
<sax> But the Lord is trustworthy and will strengthen you, and protect you from the Evil One. ||| Jiosh at hemho wa am hab wo juh mo haschu i t-ahgid. S-mahch ach mat ab wo i em-mah g gewkdag k wo em-nuhkud mat pi wo em-gehg g Jiawul.
<sax> We have great confidence in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do what we told you. ||| Dam t-wehm wohochuddam. Kuch heg hekaj hab em-elid mam am hab junihim hegai mach ab i em-mashcham ch am hab wabsh wo i junihid.
<sax> You certainly know that you should follow our example, because while we were with you we weren't lazy, ||| Am am wa t-neid mach wa pi shaꞌi papadma mach wa am em-wehmajkahim. Kum am wa s-mahch mamt am chum t-oidk hab wo wa masmak.
<sax> —we didn't eat anyone's food without paying for it. Instead we worked hard day and night so we wouldn't be a burden to any of you. ||| Si ach wa chikpan chum hems s-chuhugam k ed matt am wo wa haꞌichu ha namkidad hegam mach hedai i kih am dadha mamt pi haꞌichu wo heki gei t-wehhejed.
<sax> Not that we don't have the right to do so—but we wanted to be an example to you, so that you could copy what we did. ||| Bo hi wa chum mahs mach apꞌedag mamt ab haꞌichu wo i t-namkid nach pi d Jiosh pionag em-wehhejed. Ch wa wabshaba hejel t-dagioꞌid matt am wo em-chehgi mamt has wo chum masmak.
<sax> Even while we were with you we gave strict instructions that anybody who didn't want to work shouldn't eat. ||| Bach wa em-ahgid mach eda am em-wehmaj mamt pi wo ha gegos hegam mo pi tatchua mat wo chikpanad.
<sax> But now we hear that there are some lazy busybodies among you who don't work at all. ||| Kah ach mo am em-shahgid haꞌi s-papadma ch pi chikpan ch wabsh himchud g has ahgadag.
<sax> We're ordering such people, urging them in the Lord Jesus, to settle down and work to pay for their own food. ||| Ch ab si ha chehani g t-kownalig Jesus Christ gewkdagkaj ch ab ha gewkemhun mat am wabsh wo i e bahbgi k wo chikpanad ch hekaj wo e dagioꞌidad.
<sax> Brothers and sisters, don't give up doing good. ||| Kumt ahpim mam wabsh s-ap am hab e junihim am hab wabsh wo i junihid g s-apꞌekam ch pi wo dagito
<sax> Take note of anyone who doesn't do what we're telling you in this letter, and make sure you don't associate with them, so that they may become embarrassed. ||| ch wabshaba wabsh wo dagito hegai matp hedai pi ab hu wo wohog elidad ihda mani ia em-chehani. Tp hems ab wo wa bei g si edadag k am wo i e apꞌech.
<sax> Notice the greeting to you from me, Paul, in my own handwriting. This is my signature on every letter I write. ||| Ahni Paul ant ia hahawa si hejel haꞌichu wo oꞌoha hab masma mani hab wa wua an wehs ni-oꞌohana ed. Mt hab masma wo s-mahchk mani d ahni.
<sax> May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. ||| Neh, ab at wo baꞌich i s-em-hoꞌigeꞌel g t-kownalig Jesus Christ.
<sax> I'm sending it to you Timothy, my dear son. May you have grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord. ||| Ab g ni-kaiham ahpi map d ni-alidag t-wohochudadag ed.
<sax> I'm always thinking of you and I'm so thankful to God, whom I serve as my ancestors did, with a clear conscience. I never forget to mention you in my prayers. ||| Chum ani hekid ab si hoꞌigeꞌid g Jiosh mani hekid i ni-hoꞌigeꞌidahun m-wehhejed. Jiosh ash wa am ha tashogid g t-shohshon matt has masma wo himad g t-doakag ch ab wo si has elidad. Kuni hab masma hab ni-wua ch hab pi shaꞌi ni-kudut.
<sax> I remember how you cried, and I so want to see you! That would make me really happy. ||| P ahpi hab waꞌap ab s-wohochud g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh. Kuni s-chegito mapt si pi ap e taht mant hekid am i m-dagito. Kuni s-m-neidamk mapt ep wo si s-hehgigk.
<sax> I keep in mind your sincere trust in God, the same trust that your grandmother Lois and mother Eunice also had—and I know that same trust continues in you. ||| Am apt ha oidk hab e juh g e-huꞌul Lois ch e-jeꞌe Eunice mapt ab i s-wohoch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.
<sax> That's why I want to remind you to revitalize God's gracious gift to you which you received when I placed my hands on you. ||| Pt wo s-chegito matt ab toa g t-nohnhoi m-ab k am m-wehhejed t-hoꞌigeꞌidahu. T g Jiosh ab m-mah g gewkdag k am m-chehgi mapt has i mahs chikpan hab wo junihid wehhejed. Pegih, pt wo i e gewkad k am hab wo junihid.
<sax> God didn't give us a spirit that makes us fearful, but a spirit of power and love and good sense. ||| Jiosh at ab t-mah g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag mat an wo t-uꞌukchid ch ab wo t-mahkchid g gewkdag ch pihk elidadag ch dodolimadag ahchim mach d hemajkamgaj. Kutt heg hekaj pi haꞌichu wo shaꞌi ehbidad.
<sax> He gave this grace to us in Christ Jesus before the beginning of time, and is now revealed in the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus. He destroyed death, making life and immortality brilliantly clear through the good news. ||| Ia at jiwia g t-doꞌibiakam Jesus Christ k am i t-tashogi g Jiosh hoꞌigeꞌidadag. Kah att g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj k s-mai matt has masma s-ap am wo gahi wuwha g muhkig edgidch g pi ha huhugedam doakag.
<sax> I was appointed speaker, apostle, and teacher of this good news. ||| Jiosh at am i ni-kei mant wo ahgachugad g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj ch wo ha mashchamad.
<sax> That's also the reason I'm suffering all this, but I'm not ashamed, because I know whom I've trusted. I'm confident that he can look after what I've entrusted to him until the Day he returns. ||| Kuni heg hekaj hab muꞌi ni-shoꞌigchud ch pi shaꞌi has ni-elid id amjed nani pi s-mahch hegai mani ab s-wohochud. T heg wo e nako mat s-ap wo ni-nuhkudad mant wehs am hab wo juh mat haschu wehhejed ab i ni-gawulkai k ab wo ai mat ep wo jiwia.
<sax> You should follow the model of good advice that you learned from me, with an attitude of trust and love in Christ Jesus. ||| Ab ani m-mashcham mo has chuꞌig g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. Kupt heg wo waꞌi ahgahid nap pi heg s-wohochud ch ab si tatchua g Christ ch d hemako heg wehm.
<sax> Guard the truth that was entrusted to you through the Holy Spirit who lives in us. ||| Am o t-eda g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag ch ab t-mahkch g gewkdag. Kutt hekaj am wo si s-ap nuhkud g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh.
<sax> You already know that everyone from Asia has abandoned me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes. ||| Am ap wa s-mahch mat ia wabsh i ni-dagito hegam mo ab Asia t amjed ia ni-wehmajkahim, chum wa g Phygelus ch Hermogenes.
<sax> May the Lord be kind to the family of Onesiphorus, because he often took care of me and wasn't embarrassed about me being in prison.  When he was in Rome, he took the trouble to search for me, and he found me. ||| K wabshaba g Onesiphorus pi has e elid mani d lihso ch an i ni-gahghi ia jiwiak Rome kihhim t am am hugkam mat ni-cheh k muꞌikko ia i ni-chehgimed k ab ni-mamka g s-ap tahhadkam. Kuni ab tahni g Jiosh mat baꞌich ab wo i s-ha hoꞌigeꞌel hegam Onesiphorus.
<sax> May the Lord grant him his blessing in the Day of Judgment. (Timothy, you're very much aware of how much Onesiphorus did for me when he was in Ephesus). ||| Jiosh at wo wa s-hoꞌigeꞌel g Onesiphorus heg i tash ed matt ab wo nam g Jiosh. S-mahch ap mat heꞌes haꞌichu s-ap am hab ni-juni g Onesiphorus amai Ephesus kihhim t am.
<sax> Suffer together with me like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. ||| Neh, bapt masma wo e shoꞌigch mat g shondal am hab junihidch g e-chikpan am wehhejed g Jesus Christ.
<sax> A soldier on active duty doesn't get caught up in the business of everyday life. He wants to please the one who enlisted him. ||| S-mahch ap mat g shondal wehs hab wo junihid hegai mat g uhgchugaj ab wo cheha ch pi haꞌichu wo hiwigi mas wo shohbi. Kupt ahpi hab waꞌap wo masmak am wehhejed g Jiosh.
<sax> Similarly athletes who compete in the games don't win a prize if they don't keep to the rules. ||| S-mahch ap mat g s-melidkam pi ab hu wo bei g e-gehgewi heg hi wa mat am hab wo junihid g ha-chehanig. Kupt ahpi hab waꞌi masma wo bei g e-gehgewi mapt am Jiosh tatchui oidk hab wo e junihid.
<sax> The farmer that does all the hard work should be the first to benefit from the crop. ||| Hegai mo si chikpan g e-esha at wehpeg ab wo ui g e-oda mat wo bai. Kupt ahpi hab waꞌap ab haꞌichu wo i nei am chikpank g Jiosh wehhejed.
<sax> Think about what I'm telling you. The Lord will help you to understand all this. ||| Am g i oidahim ihda mani m-ahgid. T g Jiosh am wo i m-wehmt mapt wo s-amich.
<sax> Focus your mind on Jesus Christ, a descendant of David, who was raised from the dead. This is my good news, ||| Jesus Christ o hab waꞌap d oꞌodham ch ab s-ap nakog g shoꞌigdag. T g Jiosh ab uhpam i wuhshad heg i dahm mat muh. Do ihda s-kehg haꞌichu ahga mani am ahgachug. Kupt am wo oidahid mat haschu ab nako g Christ ch s-ap ab wo nako g e-shoꞌigdag.
<sax> and I'm suffering imprisonment because of it as if I were a criminal—but the word of God is not imprisoned. ||| Ni ahni hab waꞌap ni-shoꞌigchud am ahgachugch ihda s-kehg haꞌichu ahga hask mam ep ge ni-wulshch g e hukshchim wapainomikaj hab masma mantp d si pi ap hemajkam. K wabshaba g Jiosh neꞌoki pi e wulshch.
<sax> Despite all this I'm willing to keep on going for the sake of God's people so that they may gain the salvation of Christ Jesus that is eternal glory. ||| Am ani wabsh i ni-dagitokch mantp haschu ab wo i nako ha wehhejed hegam mat g Jiosh am i apꞌech mat wo e doꞌibia. Idam at ab wo i s-wohoch g haꞌichu t-ahga ab amjed g Jesus Christ. T g Jiosh chum hekid ab wo si has ha elidad.
<sax> Make sure you work hard so you can present yourself to God and gain his approval. Be a worker that doesn't need to be embarrassed, using the word of truth correctly. ||| Am g si i e nakog mapt d wo si s-ap piongajk g Jiosh ch si s-ap am wo ha mashchamad g Jiosh wohokam mapt pi wo shaꞌi si e elidad.
<sax> Avoid pointless chatter because people who do this are heading away from God.  Their teachings are as destructive as gangrene that destroys healthy flesh. Hymenaeus and Philetus are like this.  They have deviated from the truth by saying that the resurrection has already happened, which has ruined some people's trust in God. ||| Haꞌi at dagito g wohokam k ha mashcham mat heki hu ab i wuwha g koꞌi muhkig amjed. Gohkajj idam mo id hekaj ha iattogid o d Hymanaeus ch Phyletus. K g ha-mashchama padchud g ha-wohochudadag hab masma mat g pi kehg hihwdag wo em-cheawuagi. Pi g ha wehm aꞌagad g ha-mashchama. Gm at hu hab wo i m-juh ab amjed g Jiosh.
<sax> But God's solid, trustworthy foundation stone stands firm, with this inscription, “The Lord knows those who belong to him,” and “Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord should stay away from all that is evil.” ||| T wabshaba g Jiosh s-wihnam shondad g e-neꞌoki mat pi hedai wo shaꞌi gawul juh. K an oꞌohanas:
<sax> A stately home doesn't just have cups and bowls made of gold and silver. It also has ones made from wood and clay. Some are made for special use; others for more commonplace functions. ||| Neh, matp hems am wo haꞌichugk g nahnko mahs hohashahaꞌa am s‑kais kih ed. Tp hems haꞌi d wo ohlak ch haꞌi d wo plahtak ch haꞌi d wo uhsk ch haꞌi d wo bidk. Kut wo e hekaj hegam mo s‑namkig ha wehhejed g s‑has hahaꞌichu. T g pi namkigchu wabsh chum has masma wo e hekaj.
<sax> So if you get rid of what is evil, you will become a cup or bowl that is holy and special, useful to the Lord, ready to do all that's good. ||| Pegih, t g Jiosh hab wa masma si s‑has haꞌichukaj wo t‑hekaj mattp hedai wo t‑kegchudch ab amjed g pi apꞌekam natt pi wo t‑nahtokch ch wo i t‑gawulkadch wehhejed.
<sax> Run away from anything that fires up the desires of youth. Run after what is right and trustworthy, run after love and peace along with those who are true and pure Christians. ||| Pegih, pi g am i e dagito pi apꞌekam ch ed k am s‑ap wo i e gewkadch s‑apꞌekam k ed ch am hab wo junihid mapt haschu wo ha ahgi ch wo si pihk e elidad wehs ha hekaj ch wo si s‑ap e tahtkkad ab ha wui g e‑wehm wohochuddam. T hegam mo ab ihm g Jiosh ch s‑ap haꞌichu chegito m‑wehm hab wo masmak.
<sax> Avoid foolish and childish debates, for you know they only lead to fights. ||| Bant ep wo chei mapt pi wo ha neꞌowi hegam mat wabsh wo has hu kaijjid ch pi e mahch ch e neꞌowin. S‑mahch ap mat id am wabsh wo ha uꞌapa kawhaina ch ed.
<sax> For the Lord's minister must not fight, but be kind to everyone, able to teach, patient, ||| Jiosh pionag at pi wo chum ha kawhainad ch wabsh wo si s‑hemajimak ab wehs ha wui ch wo si s‑ap ha mashchamad
<sax> Be aware that there will be troubled times in the last days. ||| Si g s‑chegitok mat wehs haꞌichu wo s‑hasigk mat d wo i ha oidch tatshk.
<sax> People will love themselves and love money. They will be boastful, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, and without God in their lives. ||| Hemajkam at wo s‑chu daꞌad ch wo si pihk e elidad g lialkaj ch wo chum si e hahaschudad. Muꞌi hemajkam at wo aꞌai s‑koꞌokam has e ahgad ch pi ab hu uhpam wo i nodgidad g s‑apꞌekam. Muꞌi at wo has ahgad g Jiosh. T g aꞌal pi ab hu wo wohog ha elidad g e‑geꞌegedga.
<sax> Heartless and unforgiving, they'll commit slander and have no self-control. Brutal people who hate what's good, ||| Muꞌi hemajkam at wo pi aꞌamdagk ch pi hedai ha hekaj wo pihk e elidad ch haꞌichu wo e iattogidad ab aꞌai e amjed ch wo s‑ta ehbidamak ch wo s‑ta kekeꞌidamak. Muꞌi at wo s‑ohhodad g s‑apꞌekam.
<sax> they will betray others and be totally thoughtless. They are absurdly full of themselves, living so much for pleasure that they don't care about loving God. ||| Muꞌi at pi ab hu wo ha tatchuad hegam mo d chum ha‑naipijju ch has am wabsh wo si e wuad ch pi ab hu wo tatchuad g Jiosh ch wabshaba g pi kehg s‑tahhadkam ab wo tatchuad.
<sax> They may give an outward impression of being religious, but they don't actually believe it works. Stay away from these people! ||| Hemajkam at hi wo wa e mihshmdad ch wabsh pi wo wohochudad hegai mo haschu ab chum kah ch im hu hab wabsh wo i juh g Jiosh gewkdag. Pi g am hu ha wehmajk idam hab mahs hemajkam.
<sax> They're the kind of people that slip into homes and take control of vulnerable women who are burdened down by the guilt of sin and distracted by all kinds of desires. ||| Haꞌi at am wabsh ep wo si i wahpkad ha‑kihki ed ch wo s‑ap ha iattogi g uꞌuwi. T hegam mo pi gewkpdag am e‑wohochudadag ed ab wo ha kaihamad no pi tatchua g pi apꞌekam ch e kudut g e‑chuꞌijigkaj
<sax> These women are always trying to learn but they're never able to understand the truth! ||| ch pi mahch g wohokam, chum as hems hi wa chum s‑mahchimk.
<sax> Just like Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, these teachers also oppose the truth. They are people with corrupted minds whose supposed trust in God is a lie. ||| Hegam mo ha iattogid o ab wui gegok g wohokam hab masma mo wa Jannesbad ch Jambresbad ab wui gegok g Mosesbad. Ho o wabsh pi ap haꞌichu chegito ch d ep hegam mat pi e nako am Jesus wohochudadag ed.
<sax> how I've been persecuted and what I've suffered. You know what happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra—the troubles I had and how the Lord rescued me from all of them. ||| S‑mahch ap mam ni‑shoꞌigchud. Kuni muꞌi haꞌichu s‑koꞌok nakog. S‑mahch ap mant muꞌi haꞌichu nako am Antiok t am ch Iconium t am ch Lystra t am. T wabshaba g Jiosh ni‑doꞌibia wehs amjed ihda.
<sax> Of course it's true that everyone who wants to live a life devoted to God in Christ Jesus will experience persecution, ||| Kupt ahpi hab waꞌap wo e shoꞌigch natt pi wehs wo t‑shoꞌigch ahchim mach tatchua matt am wo oidad g s‑apꞌekam doakag ab si i t‑dagitok Jesus wui.
<sax> while wicked people and frauds will do well, going from bad to worse, deceiving others and deceiving themselves too. ||| T wo i e gewpkai g pi apꞌekam ch s‑chu iꞌattomkam k baꞌich wo i ha iattogidad g hemajkam ch hejel wo e iattogidad.
<sax> But you must hold onto the things you've learned and are convinced are true. You know who taught you. ||| Tt wabshaba ab i m‑mashcha g wohokam. Kupt ab si s‑gewkam i s‑wohochud k wo s‑wihnam uꞌukchid s‑mahchch matt hedai m‑mashcha.
<sax> From your childhood you've known the holy Scriptures which can give you understanding for salvation by trusting in Christ Jesus. ||| S‑mahch ap map ga hu i e‑alijk amjed ab kaiham g Jiosh oꞌohana. K id d hegai map amjed ab bekch g e‑amichudadag. Kupt hekaj ab i s‑wohoch g Jesus Christ k e doꞌibia.
<sax> All Scripture inspired by God is useful for teaching, for confronting what is wrong, for setting us straight, and for telling us what is right. ||| Ab o tashogid g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag hegai mo g Jiosh tatchua mat an wo e oꞌohan k d wo t‑mashchamak.

<sax> This is what I instruct you to do before God and Christ Jesus who will judge the living and the dead when he comes to establish his kingdom. ||| Jesus at am s‑ap wo i nahto g e‑kownaltalig ia ep jiwiak k wo ha lodai wehs hemajkam, chum hems hegam mat eda d wabsh wo kia dodakamk.

<sax> They will stop listening to the truth and wander off following myths. ||| k g wohokam mashchama wo dagito k ab wo hiwgad g hohoꞌoki aꞌagida.
<sax> You need to keep your wits about you at all times. Put up with troubles, do the work of sharing the good news, fulfill your ministry. ||| Pt wabshaba ahpi wo si s‑e nenꞌoidk ch wo s‑e chegitok wehs haꞌichu k ed ch ab wo nako g shoꞌigdag.

<sax> For I'm about to be sacrificed—the time of my death is approaching. ||| Ahni at hi e ai g ni‑tashga mant wo ni‑muhkid.

<sax> Now there's a prize reserved for me—the crown for a life lived according to what is right. The Lord, (who is the judge that always does what's right), will give that to me on that Day. And not just to me, but to everyone who longs for his coming. ||| K heg am waꞌi wiꞌis mant wo bei g s‑apꞌekam ni‑gehgewi nani pi g s‑apꞌekam am hab junihim.

<sax> Please try to come to me as soon as you can. ||| Am g i e nakog k s‑hohtam ab i ni‑chehgimed
<sax> Demas has abandoned me because he loves the things of this world more, and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia. ||| nant pi hejel ia wih.

<sax> You watch out for him too, because he was very much against what we were saying. ||| Neh, pt wo si s‑e nenꞌoidad ab amjed no pi shaꞌi si wui kehk g haꞌichu t‑ahga.
<sax> When it came to my first defense,  no-one stood up for me—everyone abandoned me. May they not be blamed for this. ||| Hegam mat wo chum i ni‑wehmt at ia wabsh i ni‑dagito mamt wa wehpeg ni‑lodai. Ab ani tahni g Jiosh mat pi ab hu wo ha abch ihda.

<sax> Please try to come before winter. Eubulus sends his best wishes—and Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers and sisters too. ||| Am g i e nakog k ab wo i hih mat koi wo e ai g s‑hehpichꞌedkam.

<sax> I did write about this to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves being in charge, refuses to accept our authority.  So if I do visit, I will make it clear what he's been doing. He's been making malicious accusations against us. Not satisfied with doing that, he refuses to welcome any other brothers. He won't let anyone else welcome them either, and throws those who do so out of the church. ||| Id ani chum em-tashogid heki hu ni-oꞌohana ed ahpim mam am e wehm e mihshmad.

You rejected the One who is Holy and Right, and demanded a murderer be released to you.  You killed the Author of life, the one God raised from the dead—and we are witnesses to this.  By trusting in Jesus' name this man was healed by him. You see this man here; you know him. Through trusting in Jesus this man has received complete healing right in front of all of you. ||| Jiosh si Kehsha at hab t‑juni nach pi ab hiwig.

<sax> If so, all of you should know, and all the people of Israel, that it was in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, the one you killed on a cross and whom God raised from the dead—it's because of him that this man stands before you completely healed. ||| Pegih, nt wo em‑ahgi mat g Jesus Christ ab i t‑mah hegai gewkdag matt hekaj doaj ihda oꞌodham.

<sax> When they heard what had happened, they prayed to God together: ||| Tsh am i kaiok am ha hekaj e hoꞌigeꞌidahun k hab kaij, “T‑kownalig Jiosh, wehs ap uꞌukch g gewkdag ch nahtokch g dahm kahchim ch jewed kahchim ch ge kahchki ch wehs haꞌichu mo haschu am i ha eda.

<sax> Now Lord: look at all their threats against us! Help us your servants to speak your word really boldly.

<sax> When they had finished praying, the building they were meeting in was shaken. All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit, and spoke the word of God boldly. ||| Tsh am i haꞌasa e hoꞌigeꞌidahu.

<sax> None of them needed anything because those who had lands or properties sold them. ||| Sh haꞌi am ha gagda g e‑oꞌoidag ch e‑kihki ch ab i uꞌu g lial
<sax> They took the proceeds and presented them to the apostles to be shared with those in need. ||| ch ab ha mamka g Jesus chuhchai mash hekid i e tatchua. Sh am hahawa aꞌai ha mamka hegam mash pi haꞌichu edgid. Sh hekaj pi hedai haꞌichu pi edgid.
<sax> Joseph, the one the apostles called Barnabas (meaning “son of encouragement”), was a Levite, a Cypriot national. ||| Sh hema d Joseph ch ab Cyprus jewed t ab d kihkam ch d chum papal ha wehm chikpandam nash pi ab d Levibad amjedkam.

<sax> He sold a field that belonged to him. Then he brought the money and presented it to the apostles. ||| Id atsh gagda g e‑oidag k ab i ui g namkigaj k wehs ha mah g Jesus chuhchai.
<sax> Now a man called Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold some property. ||| Sh am hema d Jesus ihmdam ch hab chehgig Ananias. Kush g wehmaj kihkam hab chehgig Sapphira ch hab waꞌap d Jesus ihmdam. Kutsh ihda Ananias epai gagda g haꞌichu e‑eniga
<sax> He kept back some of the money he received for himself, and brought the rest to present to the apostles. His wife knew what he was doing. ||| k hab masma hab chum e juh mat wehs ha mah g namkigaj g Jesus chuhchai k wabshaba ged hu haꞌi si toa e‑wohshag ed.
<sax> Then Peter asked him, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back some of the money from the land you sold? ||| Sh hab kaij g Peter ab wui, “Shahchu apt ahgk hiwigi g Jiawul mat am pad haꞌichu hab juh m‑ihbdag ed.

<sax> While you had the land, didn't it belong to you? And after you sold it, didn't you still have control over what you did with the money? Why did you decide to do this? You haven't lied to human beings, but to God!” ||| Hegai haꞌichu m‑eniga o d m‑eniga mapt koi gagda. Pt am i gagda. K hegai namkigaj d m‑lialiga. Pt eda hab juh ihda si geꞌe pi apꞌekam.

<sax> Peter asked her, “Tell me, did you sell the land for this price?” ||| Kush heg ab wui hab kaij, “Namt haꞌakia ui g lial mamt gagda g haꞌichu e‑eniga?”
<sax> Then Peter told her, “How could you agree together to swindle the Spirit of the Lord? Look, those who buried your husband are just returning, and they'll carry you out too!” ||| Sh hab kaij g Peter, “Ms haschu ahgk hig ahpi g e‑wehm kihkam wehm hab chum i e taht mamt wabsh wo piꞌich g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag?

<sax> Immediately she fell down dead at his feet. The young men came back in and found her dead, so they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. ||| Tsh am ha hekaj muhk k i gei wecho. Tsh ab i wahp g wechij oꞌodham k am nei matki muh k gam hu i be k ged hu cheh hugidaj an g wehmaj kihkam.
<sax> Great fear spread through the whole church, as well as among everyone who heard what had happened. ||| Tsh wehsijj ab si s‑ehbeni g Jesus ihmdam ch hegam ehp mo hedai i kah ihda.
<sax> Many miraculous signs were performed among the people by the apostles. All the believers used to meet together in Solomon's porch. ||| Kush s‑hasig haꞌichu s‑ta neidamam hab junihim g Jesus chuhchai am ha shahgid g hemajkam. Sh wehsijj si s‑ap e hehemapad hegam Jesus ihmdam heg wecho Solomonbad watto.
<sax> Nobody else dared to join them even though they were greatly respected. ||| Sh g hemajkam ab si has ha elid ch wabshaba si s‑e gihug mat ab wo i ha wehmt.
<sax> However many men and women came to believe in the Lord. ||| Tsh oi wa muꞌi ab i s‑wohoch g haꞌichu ha‑ahga ab amjed g Jesus k ab i ha wehmt. Haꞌi d chechoj ch haꞌi d uꞌuwi.
<sax> However, the high priest and those with him (who were Sadducees) became very jealous and decided to intervene. ||| Tsh g uhgchu pahl ch hegam mash hab waꞌap am oid g Sajusi himdag si s‑koꞌokam s‑ha hehgam g Jesus chuhchai
<sax> They arrested the apostles and threw them in the public jail. ||| k am i ha cheha g geꞌe cheopi nuhkuddam mat wo ha kuh. Tsh wa woho am ha kuh.
<sax> But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and led them out. ||| Tsh wabshaba heg i s‑chuhugam ab g anghil am si kuhpiꞌo g kukpaikud k ab i ha wuwhas g Jesus chuhchai k hab ha ahg,
<sax> “Go to the Temple and tell the people everything about this new way of life!” he told them. ||| “Am g wo uhpam hihim k am wo i gegokiwua geꞌe cheopi ch ed k wo ha ahgi g hemajkam mat has masma wo bei ihda pi ha huhugedam doakag.”
<sax> They did as they were told and went into the Temple at around dawn and began teaching. ||| Kutsh ab wohog elid k am hihim k am i wahp geꞌe cheopi ch ed mat wabsh i chum mahsi k am ha hekaj i ha mashcha g hemajkam.
<sax> But when the officials went to the prison they couldn't find the apostles so they went back and told the council, ||| Kutsh am chum hihi g geꞌe cheopi nuhkuddam mat wo ha ui. Kush pi am hu haꞌichug.
<sax> “We found the prison all locked up, with guards at the doors. But when we had them open up, we couldn't find anyone inside.” ||| “M att dada kukpaikud am k am chum nei. K ab wabsh kia yahwidag. K g lilso ha nuhkuddam ab ep gegok kihjeg t ab. Tt wabshaba am i chum kuhpiꞌo g kihjeg. K pi am hu hedai haꞌichug.”
<sax> Now when the captain of the Temple guards and the chief priests heard this they were totally baffled, and wondered what was going on. ||| Tsh am i ha kaiok am wabsh i pi amich mas hebai has e juh g ha‑lilsoga.
<sax> The apostles were brought in and made to stand in front of the council. ||| k am ha uꞌapa ha wui g e jehnigiddam.
<sax> “Didn't we order you not to teach in this name?” the high priest demanded to know. “Now look—you've filled the whole of Jerusalem with your teaching, and you're trying to blame us for his death!” ||| “Chum ach s‑gewkam pi em‑hiwgid mams an hu wo aꞌagad hegai Jesusbad. T eda g em‑mashchamadag ab amjed heki hu wehsko chehmo g Jerusalem. Kum ahpim ab chum t‑abchud g muhkigaj.”
<sax> But Peter and the apostles answered, “We have to obey God rather than men.  The God of our forefathers raised Jesus from the dead—the one you killed by hanging him on a cross.  God exalted him to a position of honor at his right hand as Prince and Savior, as a way to bring repentance to Israel, and for the forgiveness of sins.  We are witnesses of what happened, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him.” ||| Sh hab kaij hegam Peter, “K wabshaba g Jiosh am t‑ahgid matt am wo wa ahgahid ihda mach haschu i si t‑wuhpuikaj neid.

<sax> When the council heard this they were furious and wanted to kill them. ||| Tsh wabsh wohoꞌi babgat hegam e jehnigiddam k wabsh chum s‑ha kokdaimk.
<sax> But then one of the council members stood up to speak. He was Gamaliel, a Pharisee and a doctor of law who was respected by everyone. He ordered the apostles sent out for a short while. ||| Sh wabshaba am da hegai mash d Gamaliel ch d chehanig ha mashchamdam ch am oid g Palasi himdag. Sh wehsijj ab si has elid g hemajkam. Kutsh am i kekiwua k am ha ahgi mat gm hu wo shaꞌi i ha wuwhas g e‑lilsoga. Tsh wa woho hab ha juh.
<sax> Gamaliel addressed the council: “Leaders of Israel, be careful what you plan to do to these men. ||| Sh hab hahawa kaij ihda ab ha wui g e jehnigiddam, “Ni‑hajuni, am g wo s‑e nenꞌoidk mamt has wo ha juh idam oꞌodham.
<sax> Some time ago Theudas tried to make a name for himself, and about four hundred men joined him. He was killed and all who followed him were scattered and it came to nothing. ||| Hekid o hu i mat am hema i e maskogid k hab chehgig Theudas ch hab kaij mo d ge haꞌichu s‑mahchim.

<sax> Then after him Judas of Galilee came along at the time of the census, and he attracted some followers. He also died, and those who listened to him were dispersed. ||| T amjed am hema ep i e maskogi eda mat g hemajkam e kuint k hab chehgig Judas ch am Galilee t am d oꞌodham.

<sax> They were convinced by what he said. So they called the apostles back in, had them whipped, and ordered them not to say anything in the name of Jesus. Then they let them go. ||| k hab ha ahg g geꞌe cheopi nuhkuddam mat am wo i ha wahpki g lilso k wo ha gewitta. Tsh wa woho hab e juh. Kutsh ab ep si ha ahgi mat pi am hu wo shaꞌi aꞌagad g Jesus k hahawa ha dagito.
<sax> The apostles left the council, happy to be considered worthy to suffer shame for the name of Jesus. ||| Kush wabsh si s‑hehgig idam Jesus chuhchai am i wuwhak natsh pi ab si has i ha el g Jiosh k ab i ha mah g apꞌedag matsh si e shoꞌigch wehhejed g Jesus.
<sax> Every day they continued to teach and proclaim Jesus as the Messiah, in the Temple and from house to house. ||| Pi atsh shaꞌi haꞌasa aꞌaga g Jesus k wabshaba wehs tashkaj am wabsh i ha mashcham g hemajkam geꞌe cheopi ch ed ch am ha‑kihki ed mo g Jesus d Jiosh si Kehsha.
<sax> At this time, when the number of believers was increasing rapidly, the Greek-speaking believers started arguing with the Aramaic-speaking believers. They complained that their widows were being discriminated against in the daily distribution of food. ||| Kush am i muꞌidahim hegam mash am oid g Jesus himdag.

<sax> The twelve apostles called all the believers together, and told them, “It's not appropriate for us to give up spreading the word of God so we can wait at tables. ||| Tsh am i kah g Jesus chuhchai k am wehs i ha hemapad k hab kaij, “T‑wepnag, pi o apꞌe machs wabsh wo dagito g mihshmda ab amjed g Jiosh k im hu g lial wo hudawogad.

<sax> Everybody was happy with the arrangement, and they chose Stephen, (a man full of trust in God and of the Holy Spirit), Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus (originally a Jewish convert from Antioch). ||| Kumtsh ab si i s‑hohhoꞌi mo has kaij k am wewaꞌak i ha chuhcha.

<sax> But some started arguing with him. They were from the synagogue called “the Free,” as well as Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and people from Cilicia and Asia Minor. ||| Tsh wabshaba haꞌi ab wui gegokiwua mash am hebai e wehm e mihshmad g Tuhligo e‑himdag.

<sax> They stirred up the people, and together with the elders and the teachers of the law, they came and arrested him. They brought him before the council, ||| Kush wa woho hab kaij idam ch hekaj i ha kudu g hemajkam ch geꞌeged ch chehanig ha mashchamdam. Tsh idam wabsh woho i babgat k am hihim k an bei g Steven k ged hu uꞌapa ha wui g e jehnigiddam.

<sax> God told him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives, and go to the country that I'm going to show you.’ ||| “Sh hab kaij g Jiosh ab wui:
<sax> So he left the country of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran.

<sax> God didn't give Abraham an inheritance here, not even one square foot. But God did promise Abraham that he would give him and his descendants possession of the land, even though he had no children. ||| Tsh eda koi ab hu heꞌes shaꞌi mah ihda jewed k wabshaba am hi wa ahgid mat wo mah.

<sax> The next day when he arrived, two Israelites were fighting one another. He tried to reconcile them and stop the fight. ‘Men!

<sax> When he heard this, Moses ran away. He went and lived in exile in the land of Midian, where two sons were born to him. ||| “Tsh am i kah g Mosesbad ihda k ha hekaj gam hu i e mehkod ab Egypt amjed k gam hu i jiwia mash am d Midian jewed.

<sax> Later on, our forefathers carried it with them when they went in with Joshua to occupy the land taken from the nations the Lord drove out before them. It stayed there until the time of David. ||| Sh g ha‑amjedkam an ep uꞌahim hegai cheopi matsh hekid g Joshuabad am i e kei matsh wo i ha wanim.

<sax> But it was Solomon who built a temple for him. ||| Kutsh g Jiosh hiwigi g alidaj Solomonbad. Tsh heg am i kei g kih am wehhejed g Jiosh.
<sax> Of course the Almighty doesn't live in temples we make. As the prophet said, ||| “K eda g Jiosh baꞌich i geꞌej mo haschu i mo an hab chuꞌig t‑wehgaj. T pi wo shaꞌi e nako g oꞌodham mas wo kihch. Batsh wa masma an oꞌoha g kelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam mash hab kaij g Jiosh:
<sax> When they heard this, the council members became mad with rage, and snarled at him, grinding their teeth. ||| Tsh am i kah g e jehnigiddam mash has ha ahg g Steven k wabsh wohoꞌi babgat k si kuhm g e‑tahtami.
<sax> But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed up into heaven and saw God's glory, with Jesus standing at God's right hand. ||| Sh wabshaba g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ab baꞌich i si mahkch g Steven g gewkdag.

<sax> But they held their hands over their ears and shouted as loudly as they could. They rushed together at him, ||| Tsh si hihinkiad k am si kuhkp g e‑nahnk k ab hahawa si wui i wohp
<sax> dragged him out of the city, and began to stone him. His accusers laid their coats down beside a young man called Saul. ||| k an be k gam hu i wuhshad kihhim t amjed mat wo maꞌichkwua.

<sax> As they went on stoning him, Stephen prayed, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.” ||| Kush g Steven ab si ihm g e‑doꞌibiakam ch hab kaij, “Ni‑kownalig Jesus, ia g behꞌi ni‑doakag.”
<sax> He kneeled down, calling out, “Lord, please don't hold this sin against them!” And after he said this, he died. ||| Tsh am hahawa tohtonwua g Steven k si s‑kaidam hab kaij, “Ni‑kownalig, pi g ab hu ha abchud ihda chuꞌijig mat ihab e juh.” Bash kaij ch am i muh.
<sax> Saul approved of his killing. On that very day terrible persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and everyone except for the apostles were scattered throughout Judea and Samaria. ||| Sh g Saul am wabsh apꞌechud mamt mua.
<sax> Those who had been scattered spread the word wherever they went. ||| Kush wa an wehsko ahgahim g Jesus hegam matsh wa e gantad.
<sax> Philip went to the town of Samaria, and told them about the Messiah. ||| Hegai Philip mash wa am d ha‑kehsha atsh am hih Samaria kihhim wui k am ha mihshmad ch am ha ahgid mat heki hu an i wuhsh g Jiosh si Kehsha.
<sax> When the crowds heard what Philip was saying and saw the miracles he did they all paid attention to what he was telling them. ||| Kush ab si kaiham hegam hemajkam mo haschu i ha ahgid ch am neid mo s‑hasigam haꞌichu hab junihim g Jiosh gewkdagkaj.
<sax> Many were freed from possession by evil spirits that screamed as they came out, and many who were lame or disabled were healed. ||| Muꞌijj ash e dodajid hegam mash g jijawul an ha uꞌukch.

<sax> The people who lived in the city were overjoyed. ||| Sh si s‑hehgig g hemajkam amai.
<sax> Now there was a man named Simon who lived in the city. He practiced sorcery. He claimed that he was someone very important, and had astounded the people of Samaria ||| Sh am hema kih g oꞌodham mash hab chehgig Simon ch heki hu waꞌi amjed am hab junihim g s‑hasigam haꞌichu ch hab chum e wua mo d ge mahkai.
<sax> so they all paid attention to him. From the lowest to the highest in society they said, “This man is ‘God the Great Power.’ ” ||| Kush wehs g hemajkam am si neidachug ch ab si has elid, chum wa hegam mo d s‑chu aꞌamichuddam.
<sax> They were impressed by him because he had amazed them with his magic for so long. ||| Bash kaij ch ab si kaiham nash pi heki hu waꞌi amjed hab junihim g s‑hasigam haꞌichu.
<sax> When the apostles back in Jerusalem heard that the people of Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to visit them. ||| Tsh am i ha ai hegam Jesus chuhchai ab Jerusalem t ab matsh idam Samaria t am oꞌodham ab bei g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. Kush am ha chehani g Peter ch John matsh am wo ha mihshmedo.
<sax> When they arrived they prayed for the converts in Samaria to receive the Holy Spirit.  The Holy Spirit hadn't come to any of these converts yet—they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. ||| Tsh am hihi idam k ged hu dada k am ha wehm e hemapai.

<sax> The apostles placed their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. ||| k amjed an i ha tahtamahi ab ihmch g Jiosh. Tsh g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ab hahawa ha mah g gewkdag.
<sax> When Simon saw that the Holy Spirit was given when the apostles placed their hands on people, he offered them money. ||| Tsh g Simon am i nei ihda k chum s‑ha namkidam
<sax> “Give me this power, too,” he asked them, “so that anyone I place my hands on will receive the Holy Spirit.” ||| k hab kaij, “Ab g i ni‑mahki ihda gewkdag mant hedai ab wo i taht, t wo bei g gewkdag ab amjed g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag.”
<sax> “May your money be destroyed together with you for thinking God's gift is something that can be bought!” Peter replied. ||| Sh wabshaba hab kaij g Peter ab wui, “T wabsh wo huhug g s‑m‑kaischuda hab wa masma mapt ahpi wo huhug. Pi o hab chum chuꞌig mapt hekaj wo nolawt g Jiosh mahkigdag.

<sax> Repent of your evil ways! Pray to the Lord and ask forgiveness for thinking like this.

<sax> An angel of the Lord told Philip, “Get ready and go south to the desert road that leads from Jerusalem to Gaza.” ||| Kush g anghil am hema neok ch hab kaij ab Philip wui, “Am g i e nakog k gam hu hihm k am wo i ai hegai wohg m an hims tohono jewed ch ed am ha shahgid g Jerusalem ch Gaza.”
<sax> So Philip set out, and met an Ethiopian man, a eunuch who had a high position in the service of the Kandake, Queen of Ethiopia. He was her chief treasurer. He had gone to Jerusalem to worship there, and  was returning from his trip, sitting in his chariot. He was reading out loud from the book of the prophet Isaiah. ||| Tsh wa woho am i e nako g Philip k gam hu hih.
<sax> The Spirit told Philip, “Go over close to the chariot.” ||| Kush hab kaij g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ab wui g Philip, “An g i miabid hegai kalit k gan hu hugidaj an wo i hih.”
<sax> So Philip ran over, and heard the man reading from the prophet Isaiah. ||| Tsh am hahawa si meh g Philip k an i miabi g kalit. Kush ihda am neꞌokchulid hegai matsh g Isaiabad an oꞌoha.
<sax> “How can I, unless someone explains it?” the man replied. He invited Philip to get in and sit beside him. ||| Sh hab kaij ihda s‑has haꞌichu, “Pi ant has masma wo s‑amich, heg hi wa matp am hema wo i ni‑tashogi,” ch amjed ab i wai g Philip mat gan hu wehmaj wo dahiwua kalit ch ed. T wa woho an i chesh.
<sax> The Scripture passage he was reading was this: “He was led like a sheep to be slaughtered. Like a lamb is silent in front of his shearer, he didn't say a word. ||| Kush eda id an neꞌokchulid mo hab chuꞌig an Jiosh oꞌohana ed:
<sax> The eunuch asked Philip, “Tell me, who is the prophet talking about? Is it himself, or someone else?” ||| Sh hab kaij g s‑has haꞌichu ab Philip wui, “Am g ni‑ahgid. Dohꞌo hab ahg g Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam? No hejel hab e ahg aha no wabsh hema hab ahg?”
<sax> Philip started explaining, beginning from this Scripture, telling him about Jesus. ||| Tsh g Philip amjed am i shonch id ab mash am neꞌokchulid k am ahgid g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahga ab amjed g Jesus.
<sax> He ordered that the chariot be stopped. Philip and the eunuch both went down into the water and Philip baptized him. ||| Sh am hahawa i ahgid hegai e‑pionag mo melchudahim g kalit mat wo keshwua. Tsh am huhud ab kalit t ab k am i huhud shuhdagi ch ed. Tsh am pahl wako g Philip ihda oꞌodham.
<sax> When they came out of the water the Spirit of the Lord took Philip away. The eunuch never saw him again, but he continued on his way full of joy. Philip found himself at Azotus. ||| Tsh g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag gam hu wa hekaj i bei g Philip. Sh amjed si s‑hehgig ihda s‑has haꞌichuch gam hu uhpam meh pi hekid ep shaꞌi neidk g Philip.

<sax> But meanwhile Saul was making violent threats against the disciples of the Lord, wanting to kill them. He went to the high priest ||| Kush eda id oidam g Saul wabsh kia ha oid hegam mash am oid g Jesus himdag ch s‑gewkam ha ebkiod ch s‑ha kokdaimk. Sh am hu hebai i, sh ab si tahni g uhgchu pahl
<sax> and asked for letters of authorization to take with him to the synagogues in Damascus, giving him permission to arrest any believers in the Way that he found, men or women, and bring them back to Jerusalem as prisoners. ||| matsh am wo ha oꞌohani g papal am Damascus kihhim t am.

<sax> As Saul approached Damascus, suddenly he was surrounded by a light that blazed down from heaven. ||| Tsh am hih g Saul haꞌi ha wehm g chechoj k gam hu i aihim g Damascus kihhim. Tsh haha wabsh haꞌichu si ton ab dahm kahchim t amjed an wehgaj.
<sax> He fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?” ||| Tsh am i gei g Saul jewedo. Sh ab hema si neok ab dahm kahchim t amjed ch hab kaij, “Saul, s‑wohom ap hig ni‑shoꞌigchud.”
<sax> “Who are you, Lord?” Saul asked. ||| Sh si has elid g Saul ch hab kaij, “Dohp wud ch ab neok?”
<sax> Saul got to his feet, and when he opened his eyes, he couldn't see anything. His companions took him by the hand and led him into Damascus. ||| Tsh am hahawa i wami g Saul k ab chum si i nea. Tsh wabshaba pi ab hu mamsi g wuhpuij. Kumtsh am haha wabsh i wanimed k ged hu uꞌapa Damascus ch ed.
<sax> For three days he couldn't see, and he didn't eat or drink anything. ||| Kush waik tashkaj pi haꞌichu shaꞌi neid ch ep pi haꞌichu shaꞌi koꞌa ch pi haꞌichu ihꞌe.
<sax> A follower of Jesus called Ananias lived in Damascus, and the Lord spoke to him in a vision. ||| Kush eda am hema d Jesus ihmdam amai ch ash hab chehgig Ananias. Tsh g Jiosh am haꞌichu hab juh nenaj tahgio mash heg eda g Jesus am chehcheg.
<sax> “Get up, and go to Straight Street,” the Lord told him. “Ask at Judas' house for someone called Saul, from Tarsus. He's praying. ||| Kush hab hahawa kaij g Jesus, “Am g i e nakog k am hihm heg kih wui Judas mo am kih Shelini Kahya oidch.

<sax> He's seen in vision a man called Ananias come and place his hands on him so he can regain his sight.” ||| Kunt am nenaj tahgio haꞌichu hab juh mapt am wo jiwia wui ahpi Ananias ch ab wo taht mat ep wo mamsi g wuhpuij.”
<sax> “But Lord,” Ananias replied, “I've heard a lot about this man—about all the evil things he did to the believers in Jerusalem. ||| Sh hab kaij g Ananias, “Ni‑kownalig, ihda oꞌodham atsh muꞌi ha shoꞌigch g m‑hemajkamga am Jerusalem ch ed. Muꞌijj o hab ni‑ahgid ab amjed.
<sax> The chief priests have given him the power to arrest everyone here that worships and follows you.” ||| Kutsh heg hekaj ia jiwia mash uꞌukch g apꞌedag ab ha amjed g uꞌugchu papal mat wo uhpam i ha ui hegam mo ab m‑ihm.”
<sax> But the Lord told him, “Get on your way, because he is the person I have chosen to take my name to foreigners and kings, as well as to Israel. ||| Kush hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Am apt wo wa hih nant pi id am si i kei mat am ni‑wehhejed wo chikp am i ahgahimk g ni‑himdag ha wui g Tutuligo ch am ha wui g nahnko mahs hemajkam ch kokownal.
<sax> Immediately, something like scales fell from his eyes, and his sight was restored. He got up and was baptized. ||| Tsh ab ha hekaj i mamsi g wuhpuij. Tsh hahawa ep s‑ap haꞌichu neid k am ha hekaj i e nakog k e pahl wakon
<sax> He also had something to eat and felt stronger. ||| k ep haꞌichu hug k ab uhpam ep i gewka.
<sax> He immediately started speaking in the synagogues, saying, “Jesus is the Son of God.” ||| Kush am haꞌi chechopi g Tutuligo. Sh g Saul am ha mihshmad g e‑wehm oꞌodham ab amjed g Jesus am ah ahgidch mo d Jiosh alidag.
<sax> All who heard him were amazed, and asked, “Isn't this the man who caused so much trouble in Jerusalem for those who believed in Jesus? Wasn't he coming here to have the believers arrested and taken in chains to the chief priests?” ||| Tsh si has i el hegam mo hedai i kah k hab kaij, “Aha no pi d ihda mash an ha kokdahim hegam mash am oid hegai himdag Jerusalem t ab ch heg hekaj ia jiwia mat in wo i ha uꞌihim k am uhpam wo i ha ui uꞌugchu papal ha wui.”
<sax> Saul grew more and more confident, proving Jesus was the Messiah so convincingly that the Jews who lived in Damascus could not refute him. ||| Tsh g Saul mihshmda am i si e gewkai. Kutsh wa wohokamch mo g Jesus d Jiosh si Kehsha. Tsh hekaj pi e nako g wehmaj oꞌodham mat ab hu has wo ah.
<sax> Some time later the Jews plotted together to kill him,  but Saul learned of their intentions. Day and night they waited by the city gates looking for the chance to murder him. ||| Sh am hu i hebai amjed, tsh g Tutuligo am i e nako matsh wo mua g Saul. K eda si uhgk kolhaitas g kihhim.

<sax> So during the night his followers took him and lowered him down in a basket from an opening in the city wall. ||| Tsh hegam mat ab i s‑wohoch g Saul haꞌichu ahga ab amjed g Jesus am dai washomi ch ed k ab i huduni chuhug ch ed g wijinakaj ab amjed mash ab hebai ge wintani kolhai t ab.
<sax> When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to meet with the disciples, but they were all afraid of him because they were not convinced he was really a disciple. ||| Tsh amjed gam hu hahawa hih Jerusalem wui k ab chum ha shahgid i s‑wahkim hegam Jesus ihmdam mat ab wo i ha wehmt.

<sax> When the brothers learned of this they took him to Caesarea, and sent him to Tarsus. ||| Kutsh g Jesus ihmdam am i kah ihda k am i bei Cesaria kihhim wui k am ahgid matsh gam hu wo hih e‑kihhim wui mash d Tarsus. Neh, tsh gam hu hih.
<sax> During this time the whole church throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria was left in peace. The church grew strong and increased rapidly in numbers as the believers lived reverently for the Lord, encouraged by the Holy Spirit. ||| Tsh am hahawa dodolimat haꞌichu am ha wehhejed wehsko am Judea ch Galilee ch Samaria ch ed.

<sax> There he met a man called Aeneas who was paralyzed and had been confined to his bed for eight years. ||| Sh am hema kih g pi himidkam ch hab chehgig Aneus ch ab wabsh i s‑moik ch ash gigiꞌik aꞌahid ab pi shaꞌi e nako mas am wo i wami ab e‑woꞌikud amjed.

<sax> Everyone living in Lydda and Sharon saw him, and became believers in the Lord. ||| Kutsh muꞌijj ab i s‑wohoch g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahga ab amjed g Jesus hegam mo am kih Lydda ch Sharon kihhim t am nash pi neid matki doa ihda oꞌodham.
<sax> In Joppa lived a follower called Tabitha, (Dorcas in Greek). She was always doing good and helping the poor. ||| Sh am hema kih g uwi Joppa kihhim t am ch d e doꞌibiakam ch chum hekid s‑ap haꞌichu am hab junihim ch am haꞌichukaj i ha wehmaj g shoꞌigkam.

<sax> So Peter got ready and left with them. When he arrived they took him upstairs. All the widows were there crying, and they showed him the coats and clothes that Dorcas had made while she was with them. ||| Tsh am wa hekaj i e nako g Peter k gam hu ha oi.
<sax> Peter told them all to leave, kneeled down, and prayed. He turned to the body and said, “Tabitha, get up.” She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up. ||| Tsh gam hu wehs i ha wuwhas g Peter k am i tonwua k e hoꞌigeꞌidahu ab Jiosh wui k ab hahawa si neok wui g muhki ch hab kaij, “Tabitha, ab g i wamig.”

<sax> Peter spent a long time in Joppa, staying at the house of Simon the tanner. ||| Sh muꞌi tashkaj am dakahim g Peter Joppa t am heg wehm mash hab chehgig Simon ch ash g hogi chikpan hab wua.
<sax> In Caesarea lived a man named Cornelius who was a Roman centurion of the Italian battalion. ||| Sh am dadha g siant shondal Cesaria kihhim t am mash ab amjed g Italy jewed. Kush g ha‑uhgchuga hab chehgig Cornelius
<sax> He was a religious man who, together with everyone in his household, had great reverence for God.

<sax> At about 3 p.m. one day he had a vision in which he saw very clearly an angel of God who came to him and called to him, “Cornelius!” ||| Sh hema tash mash d i waik ohla im hab i juhk, tsh am nenaj ed hab e juh matsh am jiwia g anghil k am si chehch hab kaijch, “Cornelius.”
<sax> who is staying at Simon the tanner's house down by the sea-shore.” ||| Am o da heg kih am mo d hogi chikpandam ch hab waꞌap chehgig Simon ch am kih ge kahchki hugid an.”
<sax> When the angel who had spoken to him had left, Cornelius called in two of his house-servants and a soldier of his personal guard, a religious man. ||| Tsh amjed gam hu hahawa hih hegai anghil mash ab wui neok.

<sax> The next day, as they were on their way and approaching the city, Peter went up onto the top of the house to pray. It was about noon, ||| Sh am baꞌich d i tash matsh am dahm i juh, sh am wabsh kia hihim idam ch ab hi wa aihim g kihhim. Tsh eda g Peter gm hu hejelko him k am e hoꞌigeꞌidahun.
<sax> and he was getting hungry, wanting to eat. But while the meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance, and ||| k ash am i si bihugim k chum haꞌichu s‑hugimk. Tsh eda koi bai g hihidod. Kutsh am Peter nena ed hab e juh
<sax> he saw heaven opened. He saw something coming down that looked like a large sheet held by its four corners, being lowered onto the earth. ||| matsh ab i e kuhpiꞌo g dahm kahchim.

<sax> Inside were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds. ||| Sh id eda am haꞌichug g nahnko mahs haꞌichu doakam ch wahammad ch uꞌuwhig.

<sax> This happened three times, and then the sheet was quickly taken back into heaven. ||| Tsh waikko hab e juh ihda am nenaj ed. Tsh amjed im hu hahawa uhpam i e bei ihda haꞌichu am dahm kahchim wui.
<sax> While Peter was puzzling over what the vision he'd seen really meant, the men sent by Cornelius had found out where Simon's house was and were standing at the gate. ||| Sh am wabsh kia oidahim g Peter hegai matsh haschu nei. Tsh heg i eda idam Cornelius pionag am i s‑mai mo hebai i kih g Simon k am dada k ab gegok kolhai kihjeg t ab
<sax> They called out, asking whether Simon, also called Peter, was staying there. ||| ch ab si s‑kaidam ha kakke, “No ia hema daha mo hab chehgig Simon Peter?”
<sax> While Peter was still wondering about the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Look, there are three men looking for you. ||| Kush eda g Peter am wabsh kia chum aꞌamichud mas has d ahga hegai mat am nei.
<sax> Get up, go downstairs, and go with them. Don't worry at all because I'm the one who sent them.” ||| Pt am wo i e nakog k am wo ha nei. Pi g has shaꞌi ha elid mo d ge gawul mahs hemajkam k wabsh wo ha oi. Ahni o d ni‑tatchui mat ab i hihi.”
<sax> So Peter went downstairs to meet the men. “I'm the one you're looking for,” he said. “Why are you here?” ||| Tsh wa woho am i hud g Peter k hab kaij ab ha wui idam oꞌodham, “Ahni ani wud mam s‑ni‑neidamk. Shahchu amt ahgk ia dada?”
<sax> “We come from Cornelius, a good, religious man who has reverence for God and is widely respected among the Jewish people,” they replied. “A holy angel instructed him to send for you to come to his house so he can hear what you have to tell him.” ||| Sh hab hahawa kaij idam oꞌodham, “No pi ab t‑chehani g Cornelius.

<sax> Peter spoke with Cornelius, and then went on in where he found many other people waiting for him. ||| Kush am e wehm neneokhim ch am i wahp. Sh am muꞌi dadha g hemajkam.
<sax> He said to them, “You certainly know that it's not permitted for a Jew to be associated with or to visit foreigners.

<sax> “Four days ago, at about this time—three in the afternoon—I was praying in my house,” Cornelius explained. “Suddenly I saw a man standing in front of me, dressed in clothes that shone brightly. ||| Sh hab kaij g Cornelius, “Am ani ni‑hoꞌigeꞌidahun ni‑kih am d hu hema i tako imhab i juhk.

<sax> So immediately I sent for you, and it was good of you to come. That's why we're all here, meeting together before God, ready to hear everything the Lord has told you.” ||| “Kunt am hahawa haꞌi ha cheha mat am hihim k ab i m‑wai. Kupt s‑ap e juh k ab i hih.

<sax> You know that this good news spread throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee, following John's call to baptism.  It's about Jesus of Nazareth—how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power, and how he went around doing good, healing all those who were under the devil's control, for God was with him. ||| K wa am hema t‑jehnigid ab amjed g Jesus ch am t‑pahl wapkon ch hab chehgig John.

<sax> But God raised him back to life on the third day, and had him appear, ||| T wabshaba g Jiosh ab uhpam i wuhshad muhkig amjed mo d i waik tash k am i t‑chehgi.

<sax> While Peter was still speaking, the Holy Spirit fell on all of them who were listening to the message. ||| Sh am wabsh kia neok g Peter. Tsh ab i hud g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ha dahm hegam mo am kaiham k ab si i ha mah g gewkdag.
<sax> He gave orders for them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they pleaded with him to spend some time with them. ||| Kumtsh wa woho ha pahl wapko am chehchegch g Jesus Christ.

<sax> When Peter arrived back in Jerusalem, those who believed circumcision was still essential argued with him. ||| Sh eda am haꞌi d hegam mash hab si elid mat hemho wa hab wo juh g Tutuligo ha‑himdag hegam gawul mahs hemajkam matsh ab i s‑wohoch.

<sax> Peter began to explain to them everything that had happened. ||| Tsh am hahawa ha ahgi g Peter matsh haschu has e juh gd hu i shonchudk mo wa am e hoꞌigeꞌidahun Joppa kihhim t am ch hab kaij:
<sax> “While I was in the town of Joppa I was praying, and in a trance I saw a vision. Something that looked like a large sheet was being let down by its four corners from heaven, and it came down to me. ||| “Am ani daha Joppa t am ch am hu hebai ni‑hoꞌigeꞌidahun.

<sax> Then I heard a voice that told me, ‘Get up, Peter, kill and eat.’ ||| “K ab hahawa hema si neok ch hab kaij, ‘Peter, i g wuhshani k wabsh chum haschu am wo muꞌa k hekaj wo e gegos.’
<sax> This happened three times, and then it was all taken back into heaven. ||| Kut id hab e juh waikko. T amjed im hu hahawa uhpam i e bei ihda haꞌichu am dahm kahchim wui.
<sax> At that very moment three men were standing in front of the house where we were staying. They had been sent from Caesarea to see me. ||| “Kutki eda heki hu am haꞌi dada waik g oꞌodham. Idam ha‑geꞌejig o hab chehgig Cornelius ch am kih Cesaria t am ch ab ha cheha matsh ab wo i ni‑wai. Tki am dada mani am da.
<sax> The Spirit told me to go with them, and not to worry about who they were. These six brothers here also went with me, and we went into the man's house. ||| K hab ni‑ahgid g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag mant pi has wo shaꞌi ha el mo d ge gawul mahs hemajkam k wabsh wo ha oi.

<sax> He explained to us how an angel had appeared to him in his house, who told him, ‘Send someone to Joppa, and fetch Simon, also called Peter, ||| “K heg am t‑ahgid matsh g anghil am jiwia kihj am k hab kaij, ‘Am g haꞌi ha chehani mat am wo hihi Joppa wui k am wo wai hegai oꞌodham mo hab chehgig Simon Peter.
<sax> who will tell you what you need to hear so you can be saved—you and your whole household.’ ||| T heg am wo em‑ahgi mamt has masma wo e doꞌibia wehsijj g e‑wehm kihkam ha wehm.’
<sax> When I started speaking, the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as happened to us in the beginning. ||| “Pegih, tki wa woho hab e juh. Kunt am him k am wabsh chum haꞌichu i ha ahgid. T g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ab i hud ha dahm mat wa hab e juh am t‑wehhejed ga hu si i wehpeg.
<sax> Then I remembered what the Lord said, ‘John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.’ ||| Nt am hahawa i chegito mo wa hab kaij g t‑kownalig Jesus, ‘Mat ab i em‑mah g John g pahl wakona.

<sax> Since God gave them the same gift as he gave us when we trusted in the Lord Jesus Christ, what power did I have to oppose God?” ||| Neh, t id amjed am si i e tashogi mat g Jiosh ab ha mah hegam gawul mahs hemajkam hegai mahkigdag mat ahchim ab t‑mah mat hekid ab i s‑wohoch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ab amjed g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ.

<sax> But when some of them who were from Cyprus and Cyrene arrived in Antioch, they shared the good news with the Greeks too, telling them about the Lord Jesus. ||| Tsh am hahawa haꞌi dada Antiok t am ab amjed g Cyprus ch Cyrene k am i ha mihshmad hegam ehp mo d gawul mahs hemajkam.
<sax> The power of the Lord was with them and a large number trusted in the Lord and turned to him. ||| Tsh g Jiosh am i gewkai g haꞌichu ha‑ahga. Kutsh muꞌijj hegam hemajkam ab i s‑ha wohochud k ab i e dagito Jesus wui.
<sax> News about what had happened reached the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. ||| Tsh am i kah hegam mash ab ihm g Jesus ch ab dadha Jerusalem t ab matsh has i e juh am Antiok t am k ab hahawa cheha g Barnabas matsh am wo him k wo i ha wehmt.
<sax> When he arrived and saw for himself how God's grace was working, he was delighted. He encouraged all of them to completely dedicate themselves to God and to stay true. ||| Tsh ged hu jiwia k am i nei si s‑hehgigch matki wa woho g Jiosh ab si s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌel.

<sax> Barnabas was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit, and put his whole trust in God. Many people were brought to the Lord. ||| Sh wa eda si s‑ap d oꞌodham g Barnabas ch si e dagitokch Jesus wui ch ab si uꞌukch g gewkdag ab amjed g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag.

<sax> Then Barnabas went on to Tarsus to look for Saul, ||| Tsh hekaj hab i e ah g Barnabas matsh am wo i bei g Saul mat heg am wo i ha wehmt. Sh eda heg am kih Tarsus kihhim t am.
<sax> and when he found him, he took Saul back with him to Antioch. Over the course of the next year they worked together with the church, teaching the message to crowds of people. It was in Antioch that the believers were first called “Christians.” ||| k am i chehg k ab uhpam i wai Antiok wui.

<sax> It was during this time that some prophets went from Jerusalem to Antioch. ||| Tsh wa eda am haꞌi dada g Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam ab Jerusalem t amjed amai Antiok t am.
<sax> Around this time King Herod began to persecute some members of the church. ||| Tsh eda am i ha shoꞌigch g kownal Herod hegam mash ab ihm g Jesus
<sax> He had James, John's brother, executed by sword. ||| k ab ha chehani g e‑shondalig. Tsh idam an bei hegai James mo d John wehnag k mua g is‑pahyokaj.
<sax> When he saw that the Jews were pleased by this, he had Peter arrested too. (This was during the Feast of Unleavened Bread.) ||| Kush muꞌi si s‑hohhoꞌid g Tutuligo matsh hab e juh ihda.

<sax> After having Peter arrested, he threw him in prison, with four squads of four soldiers each to guard him. He planned to have Peter brought out for a public trial after the Passover. ||| Tsh am ha cheha g Herod g e‑shondalig matsh wabsh wo kuh g Peter.

<sax> While Peter was kept in prison the church prayed earnestly to God for him. ||| Sh wabshaba heg oidam am hahasko e hehemapad g Jesus ihmdam ch am wehhejed si e hoꞌigeꞌidahun.
<sax> The night before Herod was to have him put on trial, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, chained to each of them, and with guards at the door keeping watch. ||| Kutsh am i e ai matsh baꞌich i siꞌalim wo e lodai g Peter.

<sax> Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared, and a light shone in the cell. The angel shook Peter awake, saying “Quick! Get up!” The chains fell from his wrists, ||| Tsh am haha wabsh jiwia g anghil k am wui i kekiwua g Peter. Tsh wabsh si ton am kukpaikud ch ed.

<sax> and the angel told him, “Get dressed, and put on your sandals.” So he did. Then the angel told him, “Put on your coat and follow me.” ||| Sh hab hahawa kaij g anghil, “An g s‑wihnam i e giwuddad k ab si i wuhpud g e‑kaikia shuhshk.” Tsh wa woho hab e juh g Peter.
<sax> When Peter came to his senses, he said, “Now I realize this really happened! The Lord sent an angel to rescue me from Herod's power, and from everything that the Jewish people had planned.” ||| Tsh am haha wabsh si i e taht g Peter k hab kaij, “Neh, woho atki hab e juh.

<sax> Now that he was conscious of what had happened, Peter went to the house of Mary, the mother of John Mark. Many believers had gathered there, and were praying. ||| Tsh amjed am hih kihj wui hegai Mary mo d John Mark jeꞌe. Kush eda muꞌijj am e hemapadch ch e hoꞌigeꞌidahun.
<sax> When he knocked on the gateway door, a servant girl called Rhoda came to open up. ||| Kutsh ab si shontpag g pualit g Peter. Tsh am hema hih g ha‑pionag k hab chehgig Rhoda.
<sax> But recognizing Peter's voice, in her excitement she didn't open the door. Instead she ran back inside shouting, “Peter's at the door!” ||| Tsh heg am i amich mo d Peter ch ab neok k si s‑hehgig ch gam hu uhpam meh pi ab hu i kuhpiꞌok g pualit k ged hu ha ahgid mo g Peter ab kehk jeg ed.
<sax> “You're mad!” they told her. But she kept on insisting it was true. So they said, “It must be his angel.” ||| Sh hab kaij hegam ab wui, “Ptp wabsh chehch mo ab s‑kehkadma.”
<sax> Peter continued knocking. When they did eventually open the door, they saw it was him, and were totally shocked. Peter held up his hand for them to be quiet, and then explained to them how the Lord had led him out of the prison. “Let James and the brothers know about this,” he told them, and then left to go somewhere else. ||| Kush eda ab wabsh kia shontpag.

<sax> When daylight came the soldiers were totally confused as to what had happened to Peter. ||| Tsh am baꞌich i mahsi. Tsh am shaꞌi si e kudu hegam mash am nuhkud g kukpaikud. “T hebai hih g Peter?” bash kaij.
<sax> Herod had a thorough search made for him, but he couldn't be found. After interrogating the guards, Herod ordered that they should be executed. Then Herod left Judea and went to stay in Caesarea. ||| Tsh g Herod am hahawa si ha cheha mat am wo i gahghi. Tsh wabshaba pi shaꞌi mai mas hebai hih.

<sax> The audience shouted in response, “This is the voice of a god, not that of a man!” ||| Kush ab si hihnk g hemajkam ch hab kaij, “Pi oki d shaꞌi oꞌodham ch ab neok noki pi d ge hema jiosh.”
<sax> Immediately the angel of the Lord struck him down, because he did not give God the glory. He was consumed by worms and died. ||| Kutsh pi ha shohbi g Herod k pi am hu has el g Jiosh. Tsh heg hekaj g anghil ab ab hab juh g mumkidag mat waptopad k muh.
<sax> But the word of God spread, and more and more people believed. ||| Kutsh g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga i geꞌeda.
<sax> Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem once they had finished their mission, taking John Mark with them. ||| Tsh g Barnabas ch Saul gam hu uhpam hihi ab Jerusalem t amjed mat am i ui g lial. Kutsh g John Mark am i ha oi.
<sax> The church at Antioch had prophets and teachers: Barnabas, Simeon Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen (the childhood friend of Herod the tetrarch), and Saul. ||| Sh am haꞌi ep d Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam Antiok t am.

<sax> While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set apart Barnabas and Saul to do the work I've called them to.” ||| Kush am hu hebai wehsijj am heꞌekia tashkaj wabsh e hoꞌigeꞌidahun ch hab pi haꞌichu koꞌa.

<sax> After they had fasted, prayed, and placed their hands on them in blessing, they sent them on their way. ||| Kush am baꞌich i himchud hegai mash wabsh e hoꞌigeꞌidahun ch pi haꞌichu koꞌa ch ab hahawa ha taht idam Barnabas ch Saul matsh hekaj am chehgi mat ha dagito heg wui mat g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag am i ha tashogi.
<sax> So Barnabas and Saul, directed by the Holy Spirit, went to Seleucia. From there they sailed to Cyprus.  Arriving at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the Jewish synagogues. John was with them as their assistant. ||| Tsh gam hu hihi g Barnabas ch Saul mash wa g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag am i ha tashogid. Kutsh am ep i ha oi g John Mark matsh am wo i ha wehmt.

<sax> When the governor saw what happened he trusted in God, amazed at the teaching about the Lord. ||| Tsh ab si e tods g kownal k ab i s‑wohoch neidok mash has masma g Jiosh am chehgid g e‑gewkdag.

<sax> After the readings from the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue leaders sent them a message saying, “Brothers, please share with the congregation any words of encouragement you may have.” ||| Kumtsh am neꞌokchul g Jiosh oꞌohana.

<sax> The God of the people of Israel chose our forefathers, and gave our people prosperity during their stay in the land of Egypt. Then with his mighty power he led them out of Egypt, ||| Jiosh atsh ab i ha gawulkai g t‑shohshonbad matsh d wo hemajkamgajk. Kutsh am i muꞌida mash eda am kihkahim Egypt jewed ch ed.

<sax> But God raised him from the dead, ||| T wabshaba g Jiosh ab uhpam i wuhshad muhkig amjed.
<sax> and he appeared over the course of many days to those who had followed him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to the people. ||| Tsh amjed muꞌikko am si i e chehgi ha wui hegam mash an wehmajkahim ch ab wehmaj i hihi Galilee t amjed ab Jerusalem wui.

<sax> We are here to bring to you the good news of the promise that God made to our forefathers,  that he has now fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus from the dead. As it is written in Psalm 2: ‘You are my Son; today I have become your Father.’ ||| Kutt hemuch ia dada k ia uꞌapa ihda s‑kehg haꞌichu ahga em‑wui.

<sax> Make sure that what the prophets said doesn't happen to you:  ‘You who are scornful, look in amazement, and die! For what I'm doing in your lifetime is something that you could never believe, even if someone told you!’ ” ||| “T an ep oꞌoha g kelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam mo hab kaij g Jiosh:
<sax> The following Sabbath almost the whole town turned out to hear the word of God. ||| Sh am baꞌich d i mihshmda tash. Tsh chum alo wehsijj ab e hemapai g hemajkam matsh wo kah g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.
<sax> However when the Jews saw the crowds, they became extremely jealous, contradicting what Paul was saying and cursing him. ||| Tsh hegam Tutuligo mash pi ab hu ha wohochud si s‑ha hehgam k hab kaij mo d wabsh s‑chu iattomkam g Paul.
<sax> So Paul and Barnabas spoke out strongly, saying “We had to speak the word of God to you first. But now that you're rejecting it—you're deciding that you're not worthy of eternal life—well now we're turning to the foreigners. ||| Tsh wabshaba idam Paul am haha wabsh si ha ahgi, “Ni‑hajuni, bo chum mahs matt wehpeg ab wo em‑ahgi g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ab amjed g si Kehshaj.

<sax> That's what the Lord has told us to do: ‘I've made you a light to the foreigners, and through you salvation will go to the ends of the earth.’ ” ||| Bo wa masma am t‑chehanig Jiosh. An o oꞌohanas mash hab kaij:
<sax> When the foreigners heard this they were overjoyed, praising the Lord's word, and all those chosen for eternal life trusted in God. ||| Tsh am i kah idam gawul mahs hemajkam k si s‑hehgigam ab ihm g Jiosh nash pi ab ha makiog g e‑doꞌibiadag ahga. Kutsh hegam ab i s‑wohoch mat hedai g Jiosh i ha apꞌech mat wo e doꞌibia.
<sax> So God's word was spread throughout the region. ||| Kutsh wehsko i e ahgahi g haꞌichu ha‑ahga ab amjed g Jesus heg eda jewed.
<sax> But the Jews incited the prominent religious women and leaders of the city to persecute Paul and Barnabas, and had them expelled from their territory. ||| Tsh wabshaba g Tutuligo am si i ha chuꞌamu hegam uꞌuwi mash am ha wehm e mihshmad ch hegam mash d hahaꞌichu heg eda kihhim. Kutsh idam am si i ha shoꞌigch g Paul ch Barnabas k gam hu si ha huhuꞌi ab amjed g e‑jewedga.
<sax> So they shook the dust off their feet against them as a sign of protest, and went on to Iconium. ||| Tsh idam gam hu hahawa si i shahmud g jewed ab e‑tahtad ab am ha chehgidch mat wo ha dagito nat pi pi ap ab hu i ha nei. Tsh gam hu hahawa hihi Iconium kihhim wui.
<sax> But the Jews that refused to believe in Jesus stirred up the feelings of the foreigners, and poisoned them against the believers. ||| Tsh wabshaba am i wuwha hegam Tutuligo matsh pi ab hu wohoch k am si i ha kudu g gawul mahs hemajkam. Kutsh idam s‑ha kehꞌel g Paul ch Barnabas ch hegam ehp matsh ab i s‑ha wohoch.
<sax> Paul and Barnabas stayed there a long time, speaking to them boldly in the Lord, who confirmed their message of grace through the miraculous signs that they were enabled to perform. ||| Sh wabshaba tash am oiopo idam Jesus chuhchai ha shahgid ch am si tasho ha mihshmad ab amjed g Jesus pihk elidadag. Tsh heg ab i ha mah g gewkdag mat hab wo wuad g si s‑hasigam haꞌichu k hab masma wohokamch g ha‑ahga.
<sax> The inhabitants of the town were divided, with some supporting the Jews and some the apostles. ||| Tsh hegam hemajkam am i e gawulkai mat haꞌi ab ha wehmt g Jesus chuhchai k haꞌi g ha‑obga ab ha wehmt.
<sax> But then the foreigners and the Jews, together with their leaders, decided to attack and stone Paul and Barnabas. ||| Tsh wehsijj hegam mat ab ha wui gegokiwua g Jesus chuhchai am hahawa i e apꞌech g e‑wanimeddam ha wehm mat wo ha shoꞌigchud k wo ha maꞌichshul.
<sax> However they found out about it and fled to the region of Lycaonia, to the towns of Lystra and Derbe, ||| Tsh idam am i s‑mai mamtsh wo ha shoꞌigch k atsh gm hu wa hekaj baꞌich hahawa ep hihi Lystra kihhim wui. Ihda Lystra o am hab chuꞌig Lyconia jewed ch ed.
<sax> where they continued to share the good news. ||| Kutsh am dada k am ha ahgid g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahga ab amjed g Jesus.
<sax> In the town of Lystra there was a disabled man who was lame in both feet. He had been crippled from birth and had never been able to walk. ||| Sh am ha wui hema daha mash pi himdag ga hu i e‑alijk amjed.
<sax> He sat there listening to Paul speaking. When Paul looked directly at him, and realized that the man was trusting in God to heal him, ||| Tsh am i nei g Paul mo hab masma ab si kaiham g ahgaj mo ab si s‑wohochud mo g Jiosh woho ha doajid. Tsh ab si shel i neid
<sax> They identified Barnabas as the Greek god Zeus, and Paul as the god Hermes because he was one who did most of the talking. ||| Id oki d Zeus. Kuki heg d neokdam ch hab d Hermes.” Sh heg hab ahg Paul nash pi heg am neok.
<sax> The priest of the temple of Zeus that lay just outside the town, brought oxen and wreaths  to the town gates. He planned to carry out a sacrifice in front of the crowds. ||| Sh am mia kehk g ha‑cheopi. Kush heg eda am kehshch g Zeus. Tsh am i ha wehmaj g ha‑pahlig. Kutsh am ha uꞌapa g totolo ch haꞌichu heosig mat ab ha wui wo iagchul g Paul ch Barnabas.
<sax> But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul learned what was happening, they tore their clothes, and rushed into the crowds, shouting out, ||| Kutsh id pi ha hohhoꞌidach.
<sax> “People, what are you doing? We are human beings with the same kind of nature as you. We came to bring you good news, so you could turn from these pointless things to a God who is truly alive. He is the one who made heaven, earth, and sea, and everything in them. ||| “Pi g hab wo t‑elidad machs d jijosh. Dach wabsh oꞌodham hab masma mam ahpim.

<sax> In past times he allowed all the nations to follow their own ways. ||| Heki o hu am hab wabsh junihim g hejel e‑tatchui g nahnko mahs hemajkam. Kuki g Jiosh wabsh s‑hemajim ha nakogahim.
<sax> Even so he still provided evidence of himself by doing good, sending you rain from heaven and crops in their seasons, providing all the food you need, and filling your hearts with happiness.” ||| K wabshaba chum hekid hab chuꞌig mo am e chehgidahim no pi s‑kehg haꞌichu hab em‑junid ch ab em‑mahkch g juhki ch ab bahijid g haꞌichu em‑eꞌes mamt wo s‑kokwogk ch wo si s‑ap e tahtkkad.”
<sax> With these words they barely managed to stop the crowds from offering sacrifices to them. ||| Neh, bash kaij idam Paul ch wabshaba chum alo pi ha shohbi nash pi chum si tatchua matsh ab haꞌichu wo iagchul ha wui.
<sax> But then some Jews from Antioch and Iconium arrived and won over the crowds. They stoned Paul, and dragged him outside the town, thinking he was dead. ||| Tsh am hahawa haꞌi dada hegam mash wa am ha shoꞌigchud Antiok t am ch Iconium t am k am i ha nuꞌichkwua g hemajkam. Kutsh ab wui gegokiwua g Paul k maꞌichkwua k am i chewaimed k gam hu i wuhshad ab kihhim t amjed k am wua hab elidch mat muh.
<sax> They encouraged the believers to remain firm and to continue to trust in Jesus. “We have to go through many trials to enter God's kingdom,” they said. ||| k am si i ha gewkemhun mat am wo hihimad ch ab wo si hiwgad g Jesus. Ha‑mashchama ash hab masma matt hemho wa muꞌi haꞌichu wo nakog k am haha wo i wahp Jiosh kihdag ed.
<sax> After they had appointed elders for every church, and had prayed and fasted with them, Paul and Barnabas left them in the Lord's care, the One that they trusted in. ||| Tsh am hahawa i ha chuhcha hegam mat d wo ha wanimeddamk am ha shaꞌashagid mo hebai i e wehm e nanmek. Sh am hahawa wehsijj wabsh e hoꞌigeꞌidahun ch hab heꞌekkio pi e gegosid. Sh idam Jesus chuhchai ab hahawa i ha dadagitod Jiosh wui.
<sax> They passed through Pisidia, and arrived in Pamphylia. ||| Neh, batsh wa masma am gahi wuwha g Pisidia jewed k gm hu dada Pamphylia jewed ch ed
<sax> They spoke God's word in Perga, and then went on to Attalia. ||| k am ha mihshmdahim Perga kihhim ch ed ch amjed gm hu hahawa ep hihi Attalia kihhim t am.
<sax> From there they sailed back to Antioch where they had started out, having been dedicated there in God's grace to the work they had now accomplished. ||| Tsh am i e nahto g ha‑chikpan. Kutsh am gahi i shul ge shuhdagi ch ed an geꞌe wahlko ch ed k gam hu dada hegai Antiok t am mamtsh am i ha dagito Jiosh hemajimatalig ed.
<sax> When they arrived, they called the church together. They reported everything God had done through them, and how he had opened a door for the foreigners to trust in him. ||| Tsh am wehsijj i e hemapai hegam mash ab ihm g Jesus amai. Sh g Paul ch Barnabas am ha ahgid mat g Jiosh am si i ha wehmt k ab ha mah g nahnko mahs hemajkam g apꞌedag mat ab wo i s‑wohoch g haꞌichu ha‑ahga ab amjed g Jesus.
<sax> They stayed there with the believers for a long time. ||| Tash ash am dadkkahim ha wehm hegam mash ab ihm g Jesus amai Antiok t am.
<sax> Then some men arrived from Judea who started teaching the believers, “Unless you're circumcised according to the rules set down by Moses, you can't be saved.” ||| Kutsh am haꞌi dada Antiok t ab ab Judea t amjed k hab chum ha ahg hegam matsh ab i s‑wohoch g haꞌichu ha‑ahga ab amjed g Jesus, “Jiosh o am t‑chehani Mosesbad oꞌohana ed mat g chechoj hemho wa wo e oꞌoha an e pahl hikuchk. Kumt pi wo shaꞌi e doꞌibia mamtp pi hab wo e juh.”
<sax> When they arrived in Jerusalem they were welcomed by the church members, the apostles, and the elders. They explained everything God had done through them. ||| Kutsh ged hu dada Jerusalem t am. Tsh si s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌel g Jesus chuhchai ch geꞌeged ch wehsijj hegam mash ab ihm g Jesus amai. Tsh am hahawa ha ahgi mat haschu k ab am si i ha wehmt g Jiosh mat am hab juh.
<sax> But they were opposed by some of the believers who belonged to the Pharisee faction. They said, “These converts have to be circumcised, and instructed to observe the law of Moses.” ||| Tsh wabshaba am haꞌi ab ha wui gegokiwua hegam mash si s‑gewkam oid g chehanig ch hab kaij, “Hemho wa at wo e oꞌoha an e pahl hikuchk g chechoj k am hab wo junihid hegai t‑chehanig mo g Jiosh ab t‑mahkch.”
<sax> The apostles and elders met together to discuss the issue. ||| Tsh am ep e nam g Jesus chuhchai ch geꞌeged k tash am aꞌaga ihda.
<sax> After much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “Brothers, you know that some time ago God chose me from among you so that the foreigners could hear the message of good news and trust in Jesus. ||| Tsh g Peter am i kekiwua k hab kaij:
<sax> God, who knows our hearts, has shown that he accepts them, giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us. ||| Jiosh o s‑mahch g oꞌodham chegitoi ch ab ep ha mah g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag hab wa masma mat ahchim hab t‑juh.
<sax> He doesn't make any distinction between us and them—he cleansed their hearts as they trusted in him. ||| Kuch heg hekaj s‑mahch mo s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌelid ch gam hu hab i juh g pi ap ha‑chuꞌijig mat ab i s‑wohoch g haꞌichu ahgaj.
<sax> So why do you want to oppose God and put a burden on the believers that our fathers weren't able to bear, and we can't either? ||| Pegih, m haschu ahgch haꞌi piꞌichud g Jiosh ab s‑wehch haꞌichu ha mohtoꞌidch g wechij wohochuddam? Ahchim Tutuligo att pi shaꞌi t‑nako machs wehs am hab wo junihid g t‑chehanig. T g t‑shohshon hab waꞌap pi shaꞌi e nako.
<sax> We're convinced that we're saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same way they are.” ||| Pi attki hab masma wo t‑doꞌibia. Heg at wo waꞌi t‑doꞌibia t‑kownalig Jesus. Ab att i s‑wohoch g haꞌichu ahgaj. T heg ab i s‑t‑hoꞌigeꞌid k t‑doꞌibia. Pegih, t hab waꞌi masma wo e doꞌibia idam gawul mahs hemajkam.” Neh, bash kaij g Peter.
<sax> Simon has described how God first revealed his concern for the foreigners by taking from them a people committed to him. ||| Peter o am t‑ahgid matsh has masma g Jiosh am chehgi mo pihk e elid ha hekaj g nahnko mahs hemajkam ch am haꞌi i ha gawulkai mat d wo hemajkamgajk.
<sax> This is in accordance with the words of the prophets, as it's written, ||| K id am wohokamchud mat wa has i masma an oꞌoha g kekelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam mash wa hab kaij g Jiosh:
<sax> So my decision is that we shouldn't make it difficult for foreigners who turn to God. ||| “Kuni hab ep s‑cheꞌimk mani hab hi elid matt pi ab hu wo ha mohtoꞌi g t‑chehanigkaj hegam gawul mahs hemajkam mat ab i e nohnogi Jiosh wui.
<sax> We should write to them and tell them to avoid food sacrificed to idols, sexual immorality, meat of animals that have been strangled, and from consuming blood. ||| Tt hi wabsh wo ha ahgi mat has wo e junihid. T hab ab ha wui wo si s‑ap e tahtkkad hegam t‑wehm oꞌodham mo am ha wehm kihdag.

<sax> For the law of Moses has been taught in every town for a long, long time—it's read in the synagogues every Sabbath.” ||| Id o wehsko si s‑ap s‑e mahch no pi an ahgachug wehs kihhim ch ed ch am e neꞌokchulid t‑wehm oꞌodham ha‑chechopi ed.”
<sax> Then the apostles and elders, together with the whole church, decided it would be good to choose some representatives and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They chose Judas Barsabbas and Silas, leaders among the brothers, ||| Tsh idam Jesus chuhchai ch geꞌeged am i apꞌech am wehs ha wehm hegam mash ab ihm g Jesus amai matsh am haꞌi wo i ha chuhcha. Tsh idam am wo i ha oi g Paul ch Barnabas am Antiok wui. Sh idam d ha‑chuhchai Judas Barsabbas ch Silas nash pi g hemajkam ab si has ha elid.
<sax> and sent them with this letter: ||| Kutsh ab ha mah g oꞌohana matsh wo bek am Antiok wui. Sh hab chuꞌig ihda oꞌohana:
<sax> We have heard that some from our group have confused you with their teachings, causing you trouble. We certainly didn't tell them to do this! ||| “Idam Barnabas ch Paul o ab t‑ahgid mat am haꞌi hihi g t‑wehm oꞌodham k am em‑kudu am haꞌichu pi ap em‑ahgidk. Kuch eda wa chum pi shaꞌi ha apꞌechud mat hab wo e juh.
<sax> It seemed best to the Holy Spirit and to us not to place on you any heavier burden than these important requirements. ||| T am i t‑tashogi g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag mattki pi ab hu wo i em‑mohtoꞌi g t‑chehanig ahchim Tutuligo k wabsh wo em‑ahgi ihda mamt am hab hi wo wa junihid.

<sax> You should avoid: anything sacrificed to idols; blood; meat from strangled animals; and sexual immorality. You will do well to observe these requirements.

<sax> The men were sent on their way to Antioch. When they arrived they called everybody together and delivered the letter. ||| Kutsh am hahawa gam hu hihi idam Barnabas ch Paul ch Judas ch Silas k gam hu dada Antiok t am. Tsh am i e hemapai hegam mash ab ihm g Jesus. Kutsh am i ha mah g oꞌohana.
<sax> After they had read it, the people were so happy for the encouraging message. ||| Tsh idam am neꞌokchulid k si s‑ap i e taht natsh pi heg hekaj ab si i e gewkemhu.
<sax> Judas and Silas, who were also prophets, encouraged the brothers, explaining many things, and strengthening them. ||| Kush g Judas ch Silas hab waꞌap d Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam ch am dadkkahim heꞌes i tash ch muꞌi haꞌichukaj am i ha gewkemhu.
<sax> After spending some time there they were sent back by the brothers with their blessing to the believers in Jerusalem. ||| Kumtsh am hahawa s‑ap i ha dagito mat wo uhpam hihi.
<sax>  ||| [Tsh wabshaba g Silas hab i e ah mat wabsh ha wehm wo dakad.]
<sax> But Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and proclaiming the word of God along with many others. ||| Sh g Paul ch Barnabas heꞌes i tash am dadkkahim Antiok t am am ha jehnigidch ab amjed g Jesus. Sh muꞌijj hab waꞌap ha ahgid g haꞌichu ahga ab amjed g Jesus.
<sax> But Paul didn't think it was a good idea to take him with them, since he'd left them in Pamphylia and hadn't continued working with them. ||| Tsh wabshaba g Paul pi hohhoꞌi mat wo bek nat pi wa am wabsh i ha dagito Pamphylia t am k pi am hu ha wehm i nahto g chikpan.
<sax> They had such a strong disagreement that they separated. Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed to Cyprus. ||| Kutsh id am si pi ha apꞌet. Tsh hekaj i e gawulkai. Kutsh g Barnabas bek g Mark k gan hu aigo i shul geꞌe wahlkokaj Cyprus jewed t am.
<sax> Paul chose Silas, and as they left, the believers committed them to the grace of the Lord. ||| Tsh wabshaba g Paul g Silas am epai bek mat wo oi. Kumtsh am e hoꞌigeꞌidahun k am i ha dagito Jiosh hemajimatalig ed.
<sax> Paul traveled through Syria and Cilicia, encouraging the churches there. ||| Tsh idam Paul am hihi Syria ch Cilicia jejewed oidk k am i ha gewkemhunahim hegam mash ab ihm g Jesus.
<sax> Paul went first to Derbe, and then on to Lystra, where he met a believer by the name of Timothy. He was the son of a Jewish Christian mother, and his father was Greek. ||| Kutsh hegam Paul am hahawa hihi Derbe kihhim wui k amjed gam hu dada Lystra kihhim t am.

<sax> The brothers at Lystra and Iconium spoke well of him. ||| Sh wehsijj g Jesus ihmdam am Lystra t am ch Iconium t am am si wehhejed neok g Timothy.
<sax> Paul wanted Timothy to travel with him, so he circumcised him because the Jews in the area all knew that Timothy's father was Greek. ||| Tsh g Paul s‑behim g Timothy e wehm. Sh eda wehs s‑mahch g Tutuligo amai mat g ohgbadaj pi pahl hikuch g Timothy. Tsh heg hekaj g Paul an pahl hikuch k hahawa bek.
<sax> As they went through the different towns they gave them the requirements the apostles and elders in Jerusalem had said should be observed. ||| Kutsh am hihim k hebai i daiw kihhim t am ch am ha ahgid hegam mo ab s‑wohochud g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga hegai matsh ha oꞌohani g Jesus chuhchai ch geꞌeged am Jerusalem t am k hab ha ahgid mat s‑ap am hab wo chum junihid.
<sax> When they arrived at the border of Mysia they tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not allow them to enter. ||| Tsh gam hu dada mo an i chekshani g Mysia jewed k hab chum i e ah mat imhab uhpam wo hihi Bithynia jewed wui. Tsh wabshaba ep pi ha hiwigi g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag.
<sax> So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas. ||| Tsh hekaj gam hu gahi hihi Mysia jewed oidk k gam hu dada Troas kihhim t am. Kunt am ha nam ahni Luke.
<sax> There Paul saw in vision during the night a man from Macedonia standing up, pleading with him, “Please come over to Macedonia and help us!” ||| Tsh g Jiosh am haꞌichu hab juh nenaj ed g Paul. Sh am hema neid g Macedonia jewed t am oꞌodham. Kush id ab kehk ch hab kaij, “Ab g i hihm Macedonia wui k wo i t‑wehmt.”
<sax> After Paul saw this vision, we immediately made arrangements to go to Macedonia, since we concluded that God had called us to share the good news with them. ||| T g Paul am hahawa t‑ahgi ihda.

<sax> We set sail from Troas and made straight for Samothrace. The next day we went on to Neapolis, ||| Kutt an ha hekaj gahi i shul g geꞌe shuhdagi geꞌe wahlko ch ed k ga hu dada Samothrace kihhim t ab. Am baꞌich d i tash, tt am dada Neapolis kihhim t am
<sax> and from there to Philippi, the most important town in Macedonia, and also a Roman colony. We stayed in this city for several days. ||| k amjed gam hu baꞌich i wahp mo am d Philippi kihhim amai wehpeg chekshani ch ed g Macedonia jewed. Ihda Philippi o d si s‑has haꞌichu.

<sax> On the Sabbath day we went out of the town gates down to the riverside where we thought people would come to pray. We sat down and talked with the women that had gathered there. ||| Pi o am hu hema kehk g Tutuligo hemajkam ha‑cheopi.

<sax> One of them was called Lydia, who sold purple cloth from the town of Thyatira. She worshiped God, and she listened to us. The Lord opened her mind to what Paul was saying, and she accepted what he told her. ||| K hema hegam uꞌuwi hab chehgig Lydia ch ab amjed g Thyatira kihhim ch d s‑ihbhaimagi lohba gagdadam ch ab si ihm g Jiosh.

<sax> She went on doing this for several days. This bothered Paul so he turned around and told the spirit, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to leave her!” The spirit immediately left her. ||| Neh, bo kaij ch muꞌi tashkaj an t‑oidahim.
<sax> But when her masters saw they had lost their means of making money, they grabbed hold of Paul and Silas and dragged them before the authorities at the marketplace. ||| T am i nei hegam mo an uꞌukch mat hahawa pi has masma ep wo uꞌud g lial heg hekaj chehia k hekaj an ha ui g Paul ch Silas k gam hu i ha chewaim hahaꞌichu ha wui.

<sax> The crowd joined together in an attack on them. The magistrates tore off Paul and Silas' clothes, and ordered them beaten with rods. ||| T wehsijj hegam mat ab i e hemapai ab i ha wehmt k ab ha wui gegokiwua g Paul ch Silas. T g hahaꞌichu gam hu wuashul g ha‑wehschuga k am haꞌi ha chehani mat wo ha gewitta.
<sax> After giving them a severe beating, they threw them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them locked up. ||| Kumt am i si s‑koꞌokam ha gewittani k ged hu ha uꞌapa kukpaikud wui k hab ahgid g lilso ha nuhkuddam mat si s‑wihnam wo ha kuh.
<sax> The jailer followed his orders. He threw Paul and Silas into the inner cell and shackled their feet in the stocks. ||| T wa woho hab e juh k ged hu si chuhko ha kuh k an ha wahpki g ha‑kakhio uhs wupulshpadag ed.
<sax> The jailer woke up and saw the doors of the prison wide open. He drew his sword and was about to kill himself, thinking that the prisoners had escaped. ||| Tsh ab si i nea g ha nuhkuddam k hab e ahg mat neꞌiopa g lilso k hekaj an bei g is‑pahyo mat wo hejel e mua.
<sax> But Paul shouted out, “Don't hurt yourself—we're all still here!” ||| Sh wabshaba g Paul am si s‑kaidam hihnk ch hab kaij, “Pi g am hejel e muaꞌi. Ia ach wabsh i wehs haꞌichug.”
<sax> The jailer asked for lights to be brought and rushed in. Shaking with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas. ||| Tsh am hahawa bei g lahmpa k am si med k am i wahk k si gigiwuk. Sh am wabsh kia dadha g lilso. Kutsh ab i gei ha wecho g Paul ch Silas
<sax> He escorted them out and asked them, “Sirs, what do I have to do so I can be saved?” ||| k ab i ha wuwhasid k ab ha kakke, “Shahnt masma wo ni‑doꞌibia?”
<sax> “Trust in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved—you and your whole household,” they replied. ||| Sh hab kaij idam Paul, “B apt wo i s‑wohoch g haꞌichu t‑ahga ab amjed g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ. T heg wo m‑doꞌibia. T idam m‑wehm kihkam m ia gegok hab waꞌap wo e juh.”
<sax> Then they shared the word of the Lord with him and everyone who lived in his house. ||| Tsh idam Paul am hahawa i ha mihshmad ab amjed g Jesus.
<sax> Even though it was late at night he bathed their wounds, and he was baptized right away, along with all his family. ||| Tsh am ha hekaj i ha uꞌu k ab i wako g ehꞌed mat wa am ha gewitta. Tsh amjed am ha hekaj i e nakog k e pahl‑wapko g e‑wehm kihkam ha wehm
<sax> He took them home and had a meal prepared for them. The jailer and his whole family were full of joy because they trusted in God. ||| k gan hu hahawa i ha wahpki g Paul ch Silas e‑kih ed k ha gegos. Kush si s‑hehgig ihda wehs ha wehm g e‑wehm kihkam no pi ab hahawa wohochud g Jiosh.
<sax> But Paul told them, “They publicly beat us without a trial—and yet we're Roman citizens! Then they threw us in prison. Now they want to quietly let us go? No, they should come themselves and release us!” ||| Kush wabshaba g Paul hab kaij ab ha wui g chich‑lilihi, “Pi att hab wo t‑juh.

<sax> The officials went back and reported this to the magistrates. When they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens they were really worried, ||| Kush g chich‑lilihi am hahawa ha ahgid g s‑has hahaꞌichu mo has kaij. Tsh am i kah ihda k si e totodsid k am hihim
<sax> and went to apologize to them. They escorted them out and begged them to leave town. ||| k ab ha ahgi mat wabsh wo i s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌel k am hahawa i ha wuwhasid k hab ha ahg mat hig gam hu wo hihi ab amjed g kihhim.
<sax> So Paul and Silas left the prison and went to Lydia's house. There they met with the believers, encouraged them, and then went on their way. ||| T g Paul ch Silas am i wuwhag k gam hu hihi Lydia kih wui. Kut am e nam hegam mat ab i s‑wohoch g haꞌichu ha‑ahga ab amjed g Jesus. T idam Paul ab si i ha gewkemhun k gam hu hahawa hihi.
<sax> After Paul and Silas had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia they arrived at Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue. ||| Tsh idam Paul am wabsh gahi wuwha g Amphipolis kihhim ch Apollonia kihhim k gam hu dada Thessalonica kihhim t am. Sh am hema kehk g Tutuligo ha‑cheopi.
<sax> As usual, Paul went into the synagogue and over the course of three Sabbaths he debated with them using the Scriptures.  He explained what the Scriptures meant, proving that the Messiah had to die and rise from the dead. “This Jesus I'm telling you about—he is the Messiah,” he told them. ||| Tsh heg wui am hihi hegam Paul mo hab wa e wua chum hekid. Tsh g Paul am ha wehm aꞌaga ab amjed g Jiosh oꞌohana k id hekaj am chum wohokamch mat g Jiosh si Kehsha hemho wa wo e shoꞌigchud k wo e muꞌa k wabshaba ep wo i wuhsh ab muhkig t amjed.

<sax> Some of them were convinced and joined Paul and Silas, along with many Greek-speaking worshipers and some leading women of the town. But the Jews became jealous and with some rabble-rousers they gathered from the marketplace they formed a mob. They rioted in the town, and attacked Jason's house. They tried to find Paul and Silas so they could bring them before the people. ||| Kutsh haꞌi ab i s‑wohochud k ab i ha wehmt hegam Paul. Tsh muꞌi hegam Greek hemajkam ch hegam s‑has haꞌichu uꞌuwi mash ab ihm g Jiosh ab hab waꞌap i s‑wohoch g haꞌichu ha‑ahga k ha wehmt. Sh hema idam hab chehgig Jason.
<sax> When they couldn't find them they dragged Jason and some of the other believers before the town leaders, shouting, “These people are famous for causing trouble, turning the world upside down. Now they've come here,  and Jason has made them welcome in his house. They all defy Caesar's decrees, committing treason by saying there is another king called Jesus.” ||| Sh wabshaba pi am hu haꞌichug. Kush heg hi wa Jason am da.

K ihda Jason ab ha toꞌakch e‑kih ab.”
<sax> The believers had Paul and Silas leave for Berea that very night. When they arrived in Berea they went to the Jewish synagogue. ||| Tsh am i s‑chuk. Tsh hegam Jesus ihmdam am ha ahgi idam Paul matsh gam hu wo hihi Berea kihhim wui. Tsh ged hu dada k am ha hekaj hihi Tutuligo ha‑cheopi wui.
<sax> The people there had a better attitude than those in Thessalonica in that they were very quick to accept the word, and every day they examined the Scriptures to make sure what they were told was right. ||| Tsh idam s‑ap ab i ha nei. Sh am ha mihshmad. Kush si s‑hohhoꞌid ch ab kaiham g haꞌichu ha‑ahga ch wehs tashkaj am si hoan g Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana mat wo s‑mai mas wa woho hegai mash g Paul am ha ahgid.
<sax> As a result many of them became believers, along with some highly-placed Greek women and men. ||| Tsh muꞌijj ab i s‑wohoch g Tutuligo. Tsh muꞌijj g gawul mahs hemajkam hab waꞌap ab i s‑wohoch. Haꞌi idam ash d s‑has hahaꞌichu uꞌuwi.
<sax> But when the Jews in Thessalonica heard that Paul was also spreading the word of God in Berea, they went there and caused the same kind of trouble, stirring up the crowds. ||| Tsh am wabsh i chum kah g Tutuligo am Thessalonica t am mash idam Paul am ha mihshmad Berea t am hab wa ehp k am ha hekaj i hihim k am i ha kudu g hemajkam.
<sax> Immediately the believers sent Paul to the coast, while Silas and Timothy remained behind. ||| Kutsh heg hekaj am ahgi g Paul hegam mash ab s‑wohochud mat gam hu wo hih ge kahchki hugidgo. Tsh wabshaba g Silas am waꞌi wih Berea t am g Timothy wehm.
<sax> Those escorting Paul took him as far as Athens, and then returned with instructions from Paul to Silas and Timothy that they should join him there as soon as possible. ||| Tsh hegam matsh am i bei g Paul gam hu uꞌapa Athens kihhim t am. Tsh am hahawa ha ahgi g Paul mat wo ha ahgi g Silas ch Timothy mamt hekid wo i e nakog k ab ha hekaj wo i hihi. Tsh amjed gam hu hahawa uhpam hihi idam e‑kihhim wui.
<sax> While Paul was waiting for them in Athens he was very troubled to see all the idolatry in the city. ||| Sh am daha g Paul Athens t am ch am ha nenida g Silas ch Timothy. Sh eda wehsko chuhch g ha‑jijoshta. Sh g Paul am ha neid idam ch hab si pi ap e tahtk.
<sax> He debated in the synagogue with the Jews and those who worshiped God,  as well as in the marketplace with those he happened to meet from day to day.  Some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also argued with him. “What is he going on about?”  they wondered. Others concluded, “He seems to be teaching about some foreign gods,” because he was speaking about Jesus and the resurrection. ||| Tsh am wabsh apꞌet mat ha wehm wo si i aꞌaga g hemajkam am ha‑cheopi ed. Kush am haꞌi ha wehm e mihshmad g gawul mahs hemajkam.
<sax> As I was walking along, looking at your shrines, I found an altar that had the inscription, ‘To an Unknown God.’ This unknown God whom you worship is the one I'm describing to you. ||| Am ani neid m an chuhch g em‑jijoshta kahya oidk.

<sax> The God who created the world and everything in it, the Lord of heaven and earth, doesn't live in temples we make. ||| “Do ihda Jiosh mat wehs haꞌichu nahto ch d kownal wehs haꞌichu dahm. Wehsko o an haꞌichug g Jiosh. K pi hab shaꞌi mahs mas am hebai wabsh wo e dai hab masma mam hab ha wua g e‑jijoshta.
<sax> He doesn't need to be served by us as if he needed anything, since he is the source of all life for every living being. ||| Jiosh o ab t‑mahkch g doakag ch wehs haꞌichu. K pi am hu haꞌichu d shaꞌi hegai mas ab i si tatchua ab amjed g oꞌodham mat ab wo mah chikpank.
<sax> From one man he made all the peoples who live on the earth, and decided beforehand when and where they should live. ||| “Jiosh at am hemako nahto g oꞌodham k ab amjed i wuhshad g wehs nahnko mahs hemajkam k an aꞌai i ha gantad wehsko jewed oidk mat hebai heki hu i apꞌech mat an wo kihkad.
<sax> God's purpose was that they should seek him, hoping they would reach out for him and find him—though he isn't far from any one of us. ||| K hab d elidaj mat am wo i e gahgidahi g Jiosh k atp hems wo cheh. Pi o shaꞌi mehk ab hema i t‑amjed
<sax> In him we live, move, and exist. Just as one of your own poets wrote, ‘We are his family.’ ||| ch ab t‑mahkch g doakag ch kihdag. Haꞌijj g em‑wehm oꞌodham o d haꞌichu aꞌamichuddam ch hab kaij, ‘Ahchim hemajkam ach d Jiosh aꞌaliga.’
<sax> Since we are his family we shouldn't think that God is like gold, or silver, or stone, shaped by human artistry and thinking. ||| “Pegih neh, id o d wohokam mach d aꞌaligaj g Jiosh. Tt pi hab wo ge t‑ahgad mas g wohokam Jiosh hab mahs mo idam em‑jijoshta mat wabsh g oꞌodham am nahto g ohlakaj o g plahdakaj o g hodaikaj.
<sax> God disregarded people's ignorance in the past, but now he commands everyone everywhere to repent. ||| Heki o hu pi mahch g hemajkam g Jiosh tatchui. K g Jiosh si s‑hemajim am ha nakog. Ni wabshaba hemu em‑ahgid mo hahawa ab si i ha chehani g hemajkam wehsko mat gam hu wo s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegitoi.
<sax> So Paul left them. ||| Tsh amjed gam hu hahawa hih g Paul.
<sax> A few men joined him and trusted in God, including Dionysius, a member of the Areopagus, as well as a woman called Damaris, and some others. ||| Tsh haꞌi ab s‑wohochud k ab i wehmt. Sh hema idam d Dionysius ch d hema hegam s‑chu aꞌamichuddam. Kush am hema d ep uwi ch hab chehgig Damaris.
<sax> Paul then left Athens and went to Corinth ||| Tsh gam hu hahawa hih g Paul ab Athens t amjed k am him k am jiwia Corinth kihhim t am.
<sax> where he met a Jew named Aquila. Aquila was originally from Pontus, and had just arrived from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius  had ordered all Jews expelled from Rome. Paul went to see them, ||| Sh am hema daha g Tuhligo ch hab chehgig Aquila ch ab d mahsikam Pontus t ab. K g wehmaj kihkam hab chehgig Priscilla. Idam o d ikus kihtdam. Kutsh hab wa e juh am ha tahgio matsh g geꞌe kownal Claudius gam hu ha huhuꞌi Tutuligo ab amjed g Rome kihhim. Sh idam Aquila ch Priscilla am ahhio Corinth wui.
<sax> and because they were in the same business of tent-making, he stayed with them. ||| Tsh g Paul am i ha chehgim k am ha wehm i dahiwua k am ha wehm chikpan no pi hab d waꞌap ikus kihtdam.
<sax> He debated in the synagogue every Sabbath, convincing both Jews and Greeks. ||| Kush wehs mihshmda tash am hihim Tutuligo ha‑cheopi wui mat am wo haꞌichu i ha tashogi ab amjed g Jesus. Kush am haꞌi ep ha wehm e mihshmad hegam mo pi d Tutuligo ch am kah g haꞌichu ahgaj.
<sax> When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul felt he had to become more direct in what he said, and told the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah. ||| Kutsh am i dada g Silas ch Timothy ab Macedonia jewed t amjed. Tsh g Paul am hahawa i dagito g e‑chikpan k heg am himch matsh am hahawa si i ha mihshmad am si s‑mahch ch ahg ab ha wui g Tutuligo mo g Jesus d Jiosh si Kehsha mat wo t‑doꞌibia.
<sax> When they opposed him and cursed him, he shook out his clothes and told them, “Your blood is on your own heads! I am innocent of any guilt, and from now on I will go to the foreigners.” ||| Tsh wabshaba ab wui gegokiwua idam k am si pi ap has ahg. Tsh oi wa g Paul ab si i shahmud g e‑wehschuga ha wui mat wo ha chehgi mat ha dagito k hab kaij, “Dat wo hejel em‑chuꞌijigk mamtp wo sha pi e doꞌibia. T ahni pi ab hu haꞌichu d wo ni‑chuꞌijigk. Nt iaꞌi amjed g gawul mahs hemajkam ab wo i ha mihshmad.”
<sax> The Lord told Paul in a vision at night: “Don't be afraid. Speak up, don't keep quiet—  because I am with you, and no-one will attack you, for many people in this city are mine.” ||| Tsh am hu hebai chuhug ch ed am haꞌichu hab e juh Paul nena ed mash kah g Jesus. Kush ab wui hab kaij, “Pi g am shaꞌi haꞌichu ehbidad. Ia ani m‑wehmaj ch pi hedai wo shai hiwigi mas wo s‑koꞌokam m‑juh. Pi g shaꞌi haꞌasa ha mihshmad.

<sax> Paul stayed there for eighteen months, teaching the people the word of God. ||| Sh heg hekaj hemako ahidag ch eda hugkam ehp am haꞌichugkahim ch am ha mashcham g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.
<sax> However during the time when Gallio  was the governor of Achaia, the Jews united in an attack against Paul and brought him before the court. ||| Tsh am hahawa hema i dahiwua g kownal am Greek hemajkam ha‑jewedga am k hab chehgig Gallio. Tsh g Tutuligo am i e hemapad k an bei g Paul k am uꞌapa geꞌe kih t am
<sax> “This man is persuading people to worship God illegally,” they declared. ||| k hab kaij, “Ihda oꞌodham o chum ha chehani g hemajkam mat hab masma ab wo i ihmad g Jiosh mam has masma pi t‑hiwgid.”
<sax> But just as Paul was about to defend himself, Gallio told the Jews, “If you Jews were bringing criminal charges or some serious legal offense, there would be a reason for me to listen to your case. ||| Kutsh am haha wabsh wo i chum neo g Paul. Sh wabshaba Gallio hab ha ahg, “Pi oki ab wui kehk g geꞌe kownal chehanig. T heg hekaj pi wo ni‑apꞌet mant ab wo em‑kaiha.
<sax> But since you're only arguing over words and names and your own law, then you deal with it yourselves. I won't rule on such matters.” ||| Doki wabsh haꞌichu ahga ab amjed g em‑himdag ch ab hema i amjed g em‑wehm oꞌodham. Mt heg hekaj am hejel wo i apꞌech.

<sax> Then Gallio had them ejected from the court. ||| Neh, bash kaij ch gam hu si i ha wuwhas geꞌe kih amjed.
<sax> Then the crowd turned on Sosthenes, the leader of the synagogue, and beat him right outside the court, but Gallio wasn't concerned about this at all. ||| Kutsh idam an wabsh si bei hegai mash d ha wanimeddam am cheopi ch ed ch hab chehgig Sosthenes k am si gewitta geꞌe kih bahsho. Tsh pi ab hu has shaꞌi e taht g Gallio.
<sax> They asked him to stay longer, but he refused. ||| Sh idam ab ahgid mat am wabsh wo i wih ha wehm.
<sax> He said his goodbyes, and set sail from Ephesus, telling them, “I'll come back and see you if it's God's will.” ||| k ash hab wabsh ha ahg am wo i himk, “Matp g Jiosh d wo tatchuik, nt wo wa uhpam ep jiwia.” Neh, bash kaij ch amjed ab i chesh geꞌe wahlko t ab.
<sax> After landing at Caesarea he went to greet the church members, and then carried on to Antioch. ||| Tsh heg gam hu gahi i gei Cesaria kihhim t am.
<sax> He spent some time there and then went from town to town through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, encouraging all the believers. ||| Sh am heꞌes i haꞌichugkahim amai ch am hahawa ep ha dagito k atsh gam hu hahawa ep hih ha oidk g Galasia ch Phrygia jejewed k am i ha gewkemhunahim g e‑wehm wohochuddam.
<sax> In the meantime a Jew named Apollos, originally from Alexandria, arrived in Ephesus. He was a gifted speaker who knew the Scriptures well. ||| Tsh am hema jiwia g Tuhligo Ephesus kihhim t am k hab chehgig Apollos ch ab d mahsikam Alexandria kihhim t ab ch si s‑e mahch ab s‑neokimakam t ab ch ash si geꞌe s‑mahch g Jiosh oꞌohana.
<sax> He had been taught the way of the Lord. He was spiritually passionate, and in his speaking and teaching he presented Jesus accurately, but he only knew about John's baptism. ||| Kumtsh heki hu mashcha ab amjed g Jesus. Kush si s‑hohhoꞌid ch am ahgahim ch si s‑ap ha mashcham ch eda heg waꞌi s‑mahch John pahl wakona.
<sax> He started speaking openly in the synagogue. So when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they invited him to join them and explained the way of God to him more fully. ||| Tsh am i kah hegam Priscilla ch Aquila nash pi am si ha mihshmad Tutuligo ha‑cheopi ed. Tsh idam am i wai e‑kih wui k am s‑ap ahgid mo haschu i koi s‑mahch ab amjed g Jesus.
<sax> When he decided to go to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples there telling them to welcome him. When he arrived he was very helpful to those who through grace trusted God, ||| Kutsh hab hahawa i e ah g Apollos mat am wo hih Greece jewed wui.

<sax> “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?” he asked them. ||| Sh g Paul ab ha kakke, “Namt am wa bei g gewkdag ab amjed g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag mamt hekid ab i s‑wohoch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga?”
<sax> “So what baptism did you receive?” he asked. ||| Sh hab hahawa kaij g Paul, “A namt koi e pahl wapko g Jesus pahl wakonakaj?”
<sax> “John baptized with the baptism of repentance,” said Paul. He told the people that they should trust in the one who would come after him—that is, they should trust in Jesus. ||| Sh hab hahawa ep kaij g Paul, “M o wa woho mash heg am ha ahgid mat gam hu wo s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegitoi ch wabshaba am ep ha ahgid mat ab wo i s‑wohoch hegai mat am epai wo i e maskogi.

<sax> When they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. ||| Tsh idam ab i s‑wohochud k e pahl wapko ab chehchegch g Jesus.
<sax> After Paul had placed his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them and they spoke in tongues and prophesied. ||| Tsh g Paul an i ha tahtamahim k ab ihmahim g Jiosh.

<sax> There were about twelve of them in total. ||| Kush am hu d i gamai gohk idam chechoj.
<sax> Paul went to the synagogue and over the course of the next three months spoke boldly to those who were there, discussing with them and trying to convince them about the kingdom of God. ||| Sh am wapke g Paul Tutuligo ha‑cheopi ed ch am ha wehm haꞌichu si i aꞌaga waik mashad ab chum s‑ap s‑ha mahtchudamk ab amjed g Jiosh kownaltalig.
<sax> But some of them were stubborn, and refused to accept. They denounced the Way to the crowd. So Paul gave up on them and left the synagogue, taking the believers with him. Then he had discussions every day at the hall of Tyrannus. ||| Tsh wabshaba haꞌi pi wohochud k wabsh si pi ap neneok ab amjed g Jesus himdag am ha kaichudch g hemajkam.

<sax> so much so that they took handkerchiefs or aprons Paul had touched to heal the sick and to drive out evil spirits. ||| Sh g hemajkam chum hems ab uꞌu g Paul haꞌichu eniga ch hekaj ab tattam g kokꞌodam. Kush ha dodad. Tsh g jijawul im hu hab wo i e juh ab ha amjed hegam mo an ha uꞌukch.
<sax> Some Jews who were going around exorcising decided to use the name of the Lord Jesus when they drove out evil spirits. They'd say, “I command you to leave in the name of the Jesus that Paul talks about.”  The ones doing this were the seven sons of Sceva, a Jew and a chief priest. ||| Sh eda an haꞌi ep oiopo g Tutuligo ch hab chum e wua mo im hu hab i ha wua g jijawul ab ha amjed g hemajkam.

<sax> But one day an evil spirit responded, “I know Jesus, and I know Paul, but who are you?” ||| Sh wabshaba hab kaij g jiawul ab ha wui, “S‑mahch ani g Jesus ch ep s‑mahch mo hedai wud hegai Paul ch wabshaba ahpim pi shaꞌi em‑mahch mams hedai wud.”
<sax> The man with the evil spirit jumped on them and overpowered all of them. He beat them so severely that they ran out of the house, naked and badly injured. ||| Kutsh ihda cheoj mo g jiawul an si uꞌukch haha wabsh ha dadge k s‑koꞌokam ha juh. Tsh gam hu neꞌiopa ab amjed g kihj k d wabsh i ehꞌed. K g ha‑wehschuga wantshas.
<sax> People living in Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks, heard about this. They were all in awe at what had happened, and the name of the Lord Jesus gained great respect. ||| Kutsh wehsijj kah ihda amai Ephesus t am k atsh si s‑ehbeni k ab si has i el g t‑kownalig Jesus.
<sax> Many came to trust in the Lord and confessed their sins, openly admitting their evil practices. ||| Tsh muꞌijj hegam matsh ab i s‑wohoch s‑kehg haꞌichu ahga ab amjed g Jesus am i e hemapad k mahsko wua g pi ap e‑chuꞌijig am wehs ha tahgio g hemajkam.
<sax> A number of those who used to practice sorcery collected their books on magic and brought them to be burned publicly. They worked out how much the books were worth, and the total was fifty thousand silver coins. ||| Tsh muꞌijj hegam mash hab chum e elid mo d mamakai am uꞌapa hegam e‑oꞌohana mo an ahgas g hihoina k am ha chehgid k ha mei.

<sax> It was about this time that serious problems occurred regarding the Way. ||| Kutsh iaꞌi idani am i e kudu g hemajkam ab Ephesus t ab heg hekaj Jesus himdag.
<sax> A man called Demetrius, a silversmith, was producing small silver replicas of the temple of the goddess Artemis. This business brought in a great deal of work for such craftsmen. ||| Amai ash am hema kehk g geꞌe cheopi. Kush am eda e kehshch g uwi ha‑jioshga ch hab chehgig Artemis.

<sax> As you're no doubt aware from what you've seen and heard—not just here in Ephesus, but throughout almost the whole of Asia—this man Paul has convinced and misled many people, telling them that there are no such things as gods made by human hands. ||| Kum eda si neid ch ep kah ihda hab chehgi Paul mo hab kaij mo idam t‑jijoshga pi d shaꞌi jijosh.

<sax> It's not just a question that our business will be in danger of losing respect, but that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be considered worthless. Artemis herself would be dethroned from her high position as the one whom everyone in Asia and the whole world worships.” ||| Kut wo e padch g t‑chikpan nat pi pi ab hu hab masma wo e ihmad g Artemis mo hemuch wehsko ab si e ihm.

<sax> When they heard this they became furious, and shouted out, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” ||| Tsh am i kah idam mat am e hemapai k atsh si babgat k si s‑kaidam hihnk ch hab kaij, “B ach si has elid g t‑jioshga Artemis.”
<sax> The city was in complete chaos. People rushed towards the amphitheatre, dragging along with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's traveling companions who were from Macedonia. ||| Sh wehsko kaidag g ha‑hihinki ch wehs ha babgach g kihkam. Tsh gohk ha ui hegam mash am wehmaj g Paul k am ha uꞌapa chichwikud ed. Hegam mamtsh ha ui ash d Gaius ch Aristarcas.
<sax> Paul thought he should confront the mob, but the other believers would not let him. ||| Tsh g Paul am chum s‑wahkim ha shahgid. Tsh wabshaba g wehmaj wohochuddam pi hiwigi.
<sax> The Jews in the crowd pushed Alexander to the front. Alexander motioned with his hand for them to be quiet, wanting to explain things to the people. ||| Tsh g Tutuligo am hema i kei mat am wo him k ab wo i kekiwua ha wehhejed k am wo ha ahgi mo pi d ha‑chuꞌijig g Tutuligo. Id ash hab chehgig Alexander ch am wabsh i chum ha baꞌich i kekiwua mat am wo neo.
<sax> But when they realized he was a Jew, they all took up a chant that lasted for about two hours, shouting “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!” ||| Tsh am i nei g hemajkam mo d Tuhligo k pi ab hu shaꞌi kaiham k wabsh si hihnk e wehm am hu i gohk ohla ab hab kaijch, “B ach si has elid g t‑jioshga Artemis.”
<sax> After the town clerk had managed to quiet the mob down, he told them, “People of Ephesus, who doesn't know that the city of the Ephesians is the guardian of the temple of the great Artemis and of her image that fell from heaven? ||| Tsh g s‑has haꞌichu oꞌohandam ha shohbi g hemajkam ash hab kaijch, “Ahpim kihkam!

<sax> In fact we ourselves are in danger of being accused of being responsible for this riot today, since there was no reason for it, and we can't justify why it happened.” ||| T hahawa pi ab hu wo t‑abch g kownal machs wabsh t‑cheggia heg hekaj mat haschu has i e juh id tashkaj.

<sax> After he had spent three months there and just as he was about to sail to Syria, it was discovered that the Jews were plotting against him. So he decided to return through Macedonia. ||| k ia haꞌichugkahim waik mashad. T am hebai i cheka, t am hahawa i chum e nako mat am aigo i chesh Syria jewed wui.

<sax> These were the people who traveled with him: Sopater of Berea, the son of Pyrrhus; Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica; Gaius from Derbe; Timothy; Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia. ||| Tsh haꞌi oi g Paul mat gam hu hih.

<sax> Paul was speaking on the first day of the week as we gathered together to break bread. He was planning to leave in the morning, and went on speaking until midnight.  (The upstairs room where we were meeting was lit by many lamps.) ||| Am hu hebai d i shahwai hudunk. Tt am i t‑hemapai mo an hebai uhgk g kih k am t‑wehm t‑gegos matt am wo hehgigchul g Jiosh.

<sax> A young man called Eutychus was sitting in the window, and he began feeling very sleepy. As Paul went on speaking he fell sound asleep and tumbled down from the third story. When they picked him up they found he was dead. ||| K an hema daha g wechij oꞌodham wintani t an ch hab chehgig Eutycus ch atsh am i s‑kohsim k kohsh k i gei ab wintani t amjed k ged hu gei jewedo.

<sax> He did indeed meet us at Assos. We picked him up, and went on to Mitylene. ||| T am hahawa t‑nam k an t‑wehm dahiwua. Tt am ep gahi i shulig k gam hu ai g Mitylene kihhim
<sax> Sailing on from there we arrived off Kios, and the next day we stopped briefly at Samos, and the following day we arrived at Miletus.  Paul had planned to sail on past Ephesus so he wouldn't have to spend time in the province of Asia. He was keen to get to Jerusalem in time for the Day of Pentecost. ||| k amjed gam hu ai g Chios kihhim. K am baꞌich d ep i tash, tt gam hu ai g Samos kihhim.

<sax> When they arrived, he told them, “You know how I always behaved while I was with you from the first day I arrived in the province of Asia. ||| T am i dada. K hab kaij ab ha wui:

<sax> Now I am certain that you will not see my face again, you among whom I shared the news of the kingdom. ||| “Neh, pi amtki hekid ep wo shaꞌi ni‑nei. Ni heg hekaj s‑em‑ahgidamk mani wa wehs haꞌichu em‑ahgid ab amjed g Jiosh kownaltalig.
<sax> So I declare to you today that I am not responsible if anyone is lost. ||| K pi d ni‑chuꞌijig mamtp hema i pi wo e doꞌibia.

<sax> So watch out! Don't forget that for three years I went on instructing all of you night and day, often crying over you. ||| Neh, mt wo si e nuhkudad ch wo s‑chegitokad mani em‑mashcham wehsijj waik ahid ab ch g ni‑ohꞌog iawua s‑chuhugam oidam ch tash oidam nani pi pihk ni‑elid em‑hekaj.
<sax> Now I commit you in God's care and to the message of his grace, which is able to build you up and provide you with the inheritance that belongs to all who are kept right with him. ||| “Pegih neh, ab ant wa em‑ahgi ab amjed g Jiosh hoꞌigeꞌidadag k am haha wo em‑dagito Jiosh nohnhoi ed.

<sax> When he finished speaking, he kneeled down and prayed with all of them. ||| I am i haꞌasa neo g Paul k am hahawa wehs ha wehm tohtonwua idam k am e hoꞌigeꞌidahu.

<sax> The next day we left and went to Caesarea. We stayed at the house of Philip the evangelist (one of the Seven). ||| Am baꞌich d i tash, tt ga hu dada Cesaria kihhim t ab.

<sax> After we'd stayed there for several days, a prophet called Agabus arrived from Judea. ||| Kut ab Judea t amjed heg ab jiwia Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam mo hab chehgig Agabus.
<sax> Approaching us, he took Paul's belt, and bound his own hands and feet. Then he said, “The Holy Spirit says, ‘This is how the Jews in Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt, and will hand him over to the foreigners.’ ” ||| Ch am t‑mihshmad.

<sax> When we heard this, we and the believers there pleaded with Paul not to go to Jerusalem. ||| Kutt am i kah ihda k ab chum si i ahgid g Paul mat pi am hu wo hih Jerusalem wui.

<sax> ‘Who are you, Lord?’ I answered. ||| “Kuni si has elid ch hab kaij, ‘Dohp wud ch ab neok?’
<sax> Those who were traveling with me did see the light, but they didn't hear the voice that spoke to me. ||| K hegam mo am ni‑wehmaj hi wa neid hegai geꞌe tonlig ch wabshaba pi amichud g neꞌoki.
<sax> ‘What shall I do, Lord?’ I asked. ||| “Ni ab hahawa kakke, ‘Shahnt wo ni‑juh, ni‑kownalig?’
<sax> Since I couldn't see because of the brightness of the light, those who were with me led me by the hand into Damascus. ||| “Tki eda pi ni‑nenich heg hekaj mat wa am si s‑masma ton. T wa am wabsh i ni‑wanim hegam mo am ni‑wehmaj k ged hu ni‑uꞌapa Damascus t am.
<sax> There a man called Ananias came to see me. He was a religious man who observed the law, and was highly respected by the Jews who lived in the town. ||| “Kuki wa am hema kih g oꞌodham ch hab chehgig Ananias ch ab si ihm g Jiosh ch ep am si oid g chehanig.

<sax> I replied, ‘Lord, they certainly know that I went from synagogue to synagogue, beating and imprisoning those who trusted in you. ||| “Ni hab kaij, ‘Tp hems wo wa ni‑kaiha, ni‑kownalig, no pi s‑ap s‑mahch mani d ahni mani wa an wahkhim ha eda g ha‑chechopi ch an ha uꞌud ch ha gewittan hegam mo ab m‑ihm.

<sax> The commander ordered Paul brought into the fortress, and gave orders for him to be interrogated by flogging so he could find out the reason people were shouting so much against Paul. ||| T g shondal ha‑geꞌejig am hahawa ha cheha g e‑shondalig mat gam hu wo i wahki g Paul shondal ha‑kih ed.

<sax> As they stretched him out and tied him down to flog him, Paul asked the centurion standing there, “Is it legal to flog a Roman citizen who hasn't had a trial?” ||| T an wulsh mat wo chum gewitta.

<sax> Those who were about to interrogate Paul left immediately.

T g shondal ha‑geꞌejig ep si e tods nat pi ha cheha mat hab wo juh.
<sax> The next day, wanting to find out the reason why the Jews were accusing Paul, he had him released and taken before the chief priests and the whole council which he ordered to assemble. He had Paul brought down and placed him before them. ||| Am baꞌich d i tash, tsh g shondal ha‑geꞌejig am i ha cheha g uꞌugchu papal mat am wo i ha hemapai g e jehnigiddam nash pi s‑mahchimk mo haschu ab abchud g Paul.

<sax> Paul said to him, “God will hit you, you whitewashed wall!

<sax> The officers standing beside Paul said, “How dare you insult the high priest!” ||| K hab kaij hegam mo an miabidch gegok g Paul, “S‑koꞌokam ap has ahg g uhgchu pahl.”
<sax> “Brothers, I didn't know that he was the high priest,” Paul replied. “As Scriptures say, ‘You must not speak evil of any ruler of your people.’ ” ||| K hab kaij g Paul, “Ni‑hajuni, mant hems wo s‑mahchk mokis d uhgchu pahl, nt pi hab wo shaꞌi chei, no pi hab chuꞌig g Jiosh oꞌohana:

<sax> The argument was getting out of hand, so the commander, concerned that they would tear Paul to pieces, ordered the soldiers to go and rescue him from them by force, and take him back into the fortress. ||| T am baꞌich i si e gewkai g ha‑neꞌowina.

<sax> Afterwards, during the night, the Lord stood by Paul, and told him, “Keep up your courage! Just as you have given your testimony about me in Jerusalem, so you must be my witness in Rome as well.” ||| Sh am baꞌich d i hudunk, tsh am i e chehgi g Jesus Paul wui k hab kaij, “Ia ap si s‑mahch ch am ahgahim haꞌichu ab ni‑amjed.

<sax> Next day some Jews plotted together, and they took an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul. ||| K am baꞌich d i tash wabsh i siꞌalim, tsh am haꞌi e hemapai g Tutuligo k am chum Jiosh tahgio aꞌai si e ahgid mat pi haꞌichu wo hug k hoꞌip mua g Paul.
<sax> Over forty were part of this conspiracy. ||| Kush i baꞌiwechkim giꞌikko wehst‑mahm idam matsh hab masma e apꞌech.
<sax> They went to the chief priests and leaders and said, “We have taken a solemn oath not to eat anything until we have killed Paul. ||| Tsh am hahawa hihi ha wui g uꞌugchu papal ch geꞌeged ch hab kaij, “Matt am Jiosh tahgio aꞌai si t‑ahgi matt pi haꞌichu wo hug k hoꞌip mua hegai Paul.
<sax> So you and the council should send word to the commander that he should bring Paul down to meet with you, as if you wanted to examine his case in more detail. We're ready to kill him along the way.” ||| Kumt ahpim g e jehnigiddam ha wehm am wo ahgi g shondal ha‑geꞌejig mat ab wo i bek g Paul em‑wui.

<sax> So the centurion took Paul's nephew and brought him to the commander and told him, “The prisoner Paul called me over and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to tell you.” ||| Tsh wa woho am i bei wui k hab kaij, “Ihda wechij oꞌodham at ia jiwia k am nei hegai Paul mo ia e kuhpch.

<sax> The commander took the young man by the hand and drew him aside. “What do you have to tell me?” he asked quietly. ||| Tsh g si uhgchu ha‑geꞌejig ab bei nowij an k gam hu hekelko i wanimed k ab kakke, “Shahchu apt wo ni‑ahgi?”
<sax> “The Jews have arranged to ask you to bring Paul to the council tomorrow, as if they wanted to ask more detailed questions about his case,” he explained. ||| K hab kaij, “Ni‑wehm oꞌodham at am i e apꞌech matsh siꞌalim ab wo m‑tai mamt am wo i bei g Paul e jehnigiddam ha wui hab wabsh s‑e junimk mat am baꞌich haꞌichu wo i s‑mai ab amjed.
<sax> “Please don't listen to them, because they have planned to ambush him with more than forty men who have taken an oath not to eat or drink until they have killed him. They're ready right now, waiting for you to agree to the request.” ||| Pt wabshaba pi ab hu wo ha kaiha.

<sax> The commander sent the young man on his way, warning him, “Don't tell anyone that you've told me about this.” ||| Sh hab kaij g si ha‑uhgchuga, “Pi g am hedai shaꞌi ahgid hegai mapt haschu ia ni‑ahgi.” Tsh gam hu hahawa hih g Paul maꞌi.
<sax> He summoned two centurions and told them, “Get two hundred soldiers ready to go to Caesarea, together with seventy cavalry-men and two hundred spearmen. Be ready to leave at nine p.m. tonight. ||| Tsh g si uhgchu shondal ha‑geꞌejig gohk am ha wai g ha‑geꞌegeꞌejig k hab kaij, “Am g wo haꞌi i ha gawulkad gohk siant shondal ch wewaꞌakko wehst‑mahm ehp mo g kakawyu ha chehchej ch gohk siant ehp mo s‑e mahch ab is‑pahyo t ab.

<sax> He also wrote a letter that went like this: ||| Neh, bash kaij ch am hahawa oꞌohani hegai uhgchu kownal ihda:
<sax> I wanted to know the reason for their accusations, so I took him before their council. ||| Nt amjed am i bei Tutuligo e jehnigiddam ha wui s‑mahchimk hegai mam haschu ab abchud.
<sax> I found out the charges against him had to do with issues regarding their law, but he was not guilty of anything that merited death or imprisonment. ||| Kuki wabshaba pi am hu d shai hegai mas hekaj wo e muhkid o wo e kuhpach. Heg amki ab waꞌi abchud mat g hejel ha‑chehanig melchkwua.

<sax> So the soldiers followed their orders and took Paul overnight to Antipatris. ||| Tsh am hab e juh g shondal hegai mam haschu ab i ha chehani k am i bei g Paul chuhug ch ed k am uꞌapa Antipatris kihhim t am.
<sax> The next morning they sent him on with the cavalry, and went back to the fortress. ||| Sh am baꞌich d i tash, tsh hegam shondal mo wabsh e‑tahtadkaj hihim gam hu uhpam hihi Jerusalem wui.
<sax> When the cavalry arrived at Caesarea they delivered the letter to the governor and brought Paul before him. ||| Tsh hegam mo shoshoigakch am i bei Cesaria wui k am dada k am i mah g kownal g oꞌohana k ab wui hahawa i dagito g Paul.
<sax> After reading the letter, the governor asked Paul what province he came from. When he learned he was from Cilicia he told Paul, ||| Tsh g kownal am neꞌokchul hegai oꞌohana k ab kakke g Paul mas haschu jewed amjed. Sh heg am ahgid mo ab Cilicia jewed amjed.
<sax> “I will investigate your case when your accusers arrive.” He ordered Paul detained in Herod's palace. ||| Sh hab kaij ab wui, “M ant wo wa m‑nei mat hekid wo dada hegam mo ab haꞌichu m‑abchud.” Sh g shondaligaj am hahawa nuhkud kownal kih ed.
<sax> All of us throughout the country are so very grateful to you for this. ||| ch si s‑ap t‑tahtk chum hekid ch wabsh chum hebai ch ab si s‑m‑hoꞌigeꞌelid.

<sax> The Jews joined in, saying that this was all true. ||| Neh, bo kaij. T wehsijj am wohokamch hegam Tutuligo mat am e nam.
<sax> The Governor motioned for Paul to respond. “Recognizing you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I gladly make my defense,” Paul began. ||| T ab i ai g Paul. T g kownal ab ahgi mat am wo neo. K hab kaij:
<sax> Nor can they prove to you any of their accusations against me. ||| Pi at wo shaꞌi e nako mas wo wohokamch hegai mo haschu ab i ni‑abchud no pi pi woho.
<sax> But I will admit this to you: I serve the God of our fathers following the beliefs of the Way, which they call a heretical sect. I believe everything the law teaches and what is written in the books of the prophets. ||| “M o hi wa woho mani ab ihm g Jiosh am oidch ihda himdag mo idam hab elid mo pi d wohokam.

<sax> Some days later Felix returned with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him speak about trusting in Christ Jesus. ||| K g felix wehm kihkam d Tuhligo ch hab chehgig Drusilla. Sh idam ab s‑kaimk g Paul.

<sax> Two years passed and Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. To stay in favor with the Jews, Felix left Paul in prison. ||| Kut am i e baꞌiwich g gohk ahidag.

<sax> Three days after Festus had arrived in the province he left Caesarea to go to Jerusalem. ||| Sh am d i waik tash amjed mat am i dahiwua g Festus Cesaria t am, tsh gam hu hih Jerusalem wui.
<sax> The chief priests and Jewish leaders came to him and brought their charges against Paul.  They begged Festus as a favor to send Paul to Jerusalem, plotting to ambush and kill him on the way. ||| Tsh ab wui i hihi g uꞌugchu papal ch geꞌeged hemajkam k am ahgid hegai mo haschu ab i chum abchud g Paul ch ab si tahni mat ab wo i bei Jerusalem wui.

<sax> But Festus replied that Paul was in custody at Caesarea and that he himself would be there shortly. ||| Sh hab kaij g Festus, “Am o d wabsh kia lihso Cesaria t am. Nt eda hemuch am uhpam wo hih.
<sax> When he came in the Jews that had come from Jerusalem surrounded him and brought many serious charges against him that they couldn't prove. ||| T am i wahki. T an wehgaj gegokiwua k ab ha hekaj si pi ap haꞌichu abchud ch wabshaba pi e nako mas wo wohokamch ihda.

<sax> But Festus, who was looking to gain favor with the Jews, asked Paul, “Are you willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried before me there about these matters?” ||| K hab kaij g Festus ab wui, “Pt hig am wo hih Jerusalem wui mant am haꞌab wo m‑lodai.” Bo kaij no pi hab elid mat wo s‑hohhoꞌi g Tutuligo.

<sax> If I've committed a crime and have done something that deserves death, I do not ask to be pardoned from a death sentence. But if there's no substance to these accusations they're making against me, then nobody has the right to hand me over to them. I appeal to Caesar!” ||| Pi ant ab hu wo em‑tai mams wabsh wo ni‑dagito matp hab wo sha mahsk mant mul g chehanig. M o wa s‑apꞌe mamt wabsh wo ni‑muhkid mantp am hugkam mul.

<sax> They were staying some time so Festus presented Paul's case to the king, explaining, “There's a man that Felix left as a prisoner here. ||| Sh am heꞌekia i tash amjed, sh am ha ahgid g Festus ab amjed g Paul ch hab kaij, “Ia o hema kuhpi g oꞌodham ch hab chehgig Paul. T g Felix pi i wuhshad.
<sax> So when his accusers arrived here, I wasted no time and convened the court the very next day. I ordered the man to be brought in. ||| “T wa woho i dada hegam Tutuligo ha wanimeddam. Nt am ha hekaj dahiwua kownal daikud ed mant wo ha kaiha. Kumt ab i wahki g lihso.
<sax> However, when the accusers got up they didn't bring charges of criminal acts as I expected. ||| T am gegokiwua hegam mo ab haꞌichu chum abchud. Kuni hab ni‑ahg matp hems geꞌe haꞌichu ab wo abch ab t‑chehanig amjed.
<sax> Instead they brought up controversies over religious questions, and over a man called Jesus who was dead but whom Paul insisted was alive. ||| K wabshaba ab wabsh e‑himdag amjed ab haꞌichu neꞌowin ch heg amjed ehp oꞌodham mash hab chehgig Jesus ch atsh heki hu muh.

<sax> Since I was undecided as to how to proceed in investigating such matters, I asked him if he was willing to go to Jerusalem and be tried there. ||| “Nt am wabsh i pi ni‑amich mant has masma si tasho haꞌichu wo s‑mai ab amjed k heg hekaj ab kakke g Paul mas wo s‑hohhoꞌi mat am uhpam wo hih Jerusalem wui k ab haꞌab wo e lodaitach.
<sax> However Paul appealed for his case to be heard by the emperor, so I ordered him detained until I could send him to Caesar.” ||| K wabshaba ab t‑ahgid g Paul mat ab wo i gei si geꞌe kownal wui mat heg am wo mamche hegai mo haschu ab i abchud.

<sax> “I would like to hear the man myself,” Agrippa told Festus. ||| Kush hab kaij g Agrippa am Festus wui, “Ahni ani hab waꞌap chum s‑kaimk ihda oꞌodham.”
<sax> The next day Agrippa arrived with Bernice in great ceremonial splendor and entered the auditorium with the commanders and leading citizens. Then Festus ordered Paul to be brought in. ||| K am baꞌich d i tash, t hab masma i ha wahpki g Festus mo d si s‑has hahaꞌichu idam Agrippa ch Bernice.

<sax> “King Agrippa, and everyone who is present here with us,” Festus began, “you see before you this man whom all the Jewish people, both here and in Jerusalem, have complained to me about, shouting that he shouldn't be allowed to live. ||| K g Festus hab hahawa kaij:
<sax> Agrippa then said to Paul, “You are free to speak on your own behalf.” ||| K hab kaij g Agrippa ab wui g Paul, “B ant m‑mah g apꞌedag mapt am hejel e wehhejed wo neo.” T ab ha baꞌich i kekiwua g Paul k am e wehhejed neok
<sax> “I am delighted, King Agrippa, to make my defense before you today regarding everything I am accused of by the Jews,  particularly because you are an expert in all Jewish issues and customs. I beg your patient indulgence as you listen to what I have to say. ||| k hab kaij:
<sax> All the Jews know my life story—from my earliest days beginning in my own country and then in Jerusalem. ||| “S‑mahch o g ni‑wehm oꞌodham mani has i masma ga hu i amjed mani d wabsh kia si ali nani pi wa eda am wabsh i kih ni‑jewedga ed ab Jerusalem t ab.
<sax> They have known me for a long time and can verify, if they choose to, that I have followed the religious school that observes our faith in the strictest way—I lived as a Pharisee. ||| Dani Palasi wohochuddam. K g ni‑wehm oꞌodham s‑mahch mani am si s‑gewkam oid g t‑himdag.
<sax> Now I am standing here to be judged regarding the promised hope God gave to our fathers ||| Ia ani kehk ch wo ni‑lodai nani pi ab s‑wohochud mat g Jiosh woho hab wo juh hegai mat haschu am ha ahgi g t‑shohshonbad.
<sax> that our twelve tribes hoped to receive as they continually dedicated themselves in God's service. Yes, it's because of this hope that I'm accused by the Jews, Your Majesty!  Why should any of you think it's unbelievable that God raises the dead? ||| Bo ha ahg mat uhpam wo i ha wuwhas g koꞌi ab muhkig t amjed. Id o chum s‑wohochud g ni‑wehm oꞌodham ch eda s‑ni‑lodaitamk nani pi s‑wohochud mat hab i juh.
<sax> Previously I was sincerely convinced I should do as much as I could to oppose the name of Jesus of Nazareth. ||| “Bani wa wa elid mant am wo si i ni‑nakog k wo shohbi g himdaj hegai Jesus mo ab Nazareth t amjed.
<sax> This is what I did in Jerusalem. I threw many of the believers in prison, having been given authority to do this by the chief priests. When they were sentenced to death I cast my vote against them. ||| Ni wa wa woho am hab chum ni‑junihim amai Jerusalem t am. T wa g uꞌugchu papal ab i ni‑mah g ni‑apꞌedag.

<sax> At about noon as I was on my way, Your Majesty, I saw a light from heaven that blazed brighter than the sun. It shone around me and those who were traveling with me. ||| “Pegih neh, ahpi si s‑has haꞌichu, am achd hihim wohg ch ed am hu i dahm juhk. Kud am hab e juh mat am baꞌich i s‑mahs ton mo g tash tonlig an t‑wehgaj.
<sax> All of us fell to the ground. Then I heard a voice speaking to me in Aramaic, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It's hard for you to fight against me!’ ||| Kutt wehsijj i shul am jewedo.
<sax> ‘Who are you, Lord?’ I asked. ||| “Kunid si has elid ch hab kaij, ‘Dohp wud ch ab neok?’
<sax> ‘But pick yourself up and get to your feet. The reason why I've appeared to you is to appoint you as my servant, to be a witness for me, telling others how you have seen me and everything I will reveal to you. ||| Ab g i wamig k kekiwua.

<sax> Clearly, King Agrippa, I could not disobey this vision from heaven. ||| “Pegih neh, Agrippa map d kownal, bad wa masma am i e chehgi ni‑wui hegai mo d si geꞌe kownal am wehs haꞌichu dahm k hab wa masma ni‑cheha. Kunt ahni ab wohog elid
<sax> First in Damascus, then in Jerusalem, and then all over Judea and also to the foreigners I shared the message of repentance: how they should turn to God, demonstrating their repentance through their actions. ||| k am ha hekaj i ahgahi Damascus t am g haꞌichu ahgaj k amjed am ahgahi Jerusalem t am ch wehsko Judea chekshani ch ed.

<sax> The king recognizes this, and I'm explaining it very clearly. I am sure that he is aware of what's been happening, because none of this took place as if it were hidden in a corner. ||| ch am wabsh si tasho hab e junihim t‑shahgid. K g Agrippa wehs s‑mahch.
<sax> King Agrippa, do you believe what the prophets said? I'm sure you do!” ||| Agrippa map d kownal, m ap wa s‑ha wohochud g Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam.”
<sax> “Do you think you can convince me to become a Christian so quickly?” Agrippa asked Paul. ||| K hab kaij g Agrippa ab wui g Paul, “Nap hab elid mapt ha hekaj wabsh s‑pehegi wo i ni‑nodagi id wui Jesus himdag?”
<sax> “Whether it takes a short time or a long time doesn't matter,” Paul answered. “But my prayer to God is that not just you, but everybody listening to me today would become like me—except for these chains!” ||| K g Paul hab kaij, “Chum anis ha hekaj o gam hu baꞌich.

<sax> The king stood up, along with the governor and Bernice, and everyone who had been sitting with them. ||| T am hahawa wehs i gegokiwua
<sax> When the time came for us to sail to Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were handed over to a centurion called Julius of the Imperial Regiment. ||| Mt am hahawa dagito g Paul ch haꞌi ep lilso shondal ha‑geꞌejig wui mat am wo i ha ui geꞌechu kownal wui. Id o hab chehgig Julius ch d ha‑geꞌejig hegam mo hab e aꞌaga Geꞌechu Kownal Shondalig.
<sax> We boarded a ship based in Adramyttium that was headed to the coastal ports of the province of Asia, and we set sail. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, went with us. ||| K am hema daha g geꞌe wahlko ch atsh am gahi wo i wua Asia jewed wui.

<sax> The next day we had a brief stop at Sidon, and Julius was kind enough to let Paul go ashore and visit his friends so they could provide what he needed. ||| Am baꞌich i tash, tt am dada Sidon kihhim t am. K eda g Julius s‑hoꞌigeꞌid g Paul ch hiwigi mat am wo him k wo ha nei g e‑naipijju mat hegam wo dagioꞌi.

<sax> We sailed slowly for several days and eventually arrived off Cnidus. But since the winds wouldn't allow us to continue we sailed across to the lee of Crete, near to Salmone. ||| k am gahi i shul.
<sax> With some difficulty we made our way along the coast until we arrived at a place called Fair Havens, near to the town of Lasea. ||| Kutt heg hugid an bihbij k am hu wa has masma ga hu dada mash hebai s‑ap dadhaiwup g wapalko. K ia amjed pi shaꞌi mehk hegai kihhim mo d Lasia.
<sax> But the centurion paid more attention to the advice of the ship's captain and its owner than to what Paul said. ||| T wabshaba g shondal ha‑geꞌejig ab si s‑ha wohoch g wahlko nuhkuddam ch enigakam k pi ab hu kaiha g Paul mo ab chum ha ahgid.
<sax> Since the harbor was not large enough to over-winter in, the majority were in favor of leaving and trying if possible to reach Phoenix and spend the winter there—a harbor in Crete that faces northwest and southwest. ||| Pi o apkodag amai ha wehhejed g wapalko s‑hehpichꞌed.

<sax> When a moderate south wind began to blow, they thought they could do what they planned. They pulled up the anchor and sailed close inshore along the coast of Crete. ||| Kut ab s‑bahbagi i meh g hewel wakolim tahgio amjed.

<sax> The ship was forced out to sea and could not face into the wind. So we had to give in and allow ourselves to be driven before the wind. ||| k ab si s‑ta ehbidam wiꞌichkwua g t‑wahlko.

<sax> We were eventually able to run into the lee of a small island called Cauda, and managed with some difficulty to secure the ship's boat on board. ||| K am hema al jewedag ch hab chehgig Cauda.

<sax> After hoisting it aboard, the sailors bound ropes around the hull to strengthen it. Then, worried that they would be wrecked on the Syrtis banks, they lowered the sea anchor and allowed the ship to be driven along. ||| T g chikpandam an hahawa si s‑wihnam wupulsh g geꞌe wahlko mat pi wo e padch.

<sax> Nobody had eaten anything for a long time. Then Paul stood before them and told them, “Men, you should have listened to me and not sailed from Crete. Then you could have avoided all this hardship and loss. ||| Kuch tash pi haꞌichu shaꞌi koꞌa.

<sax> However, we will be wrecked on some island.” ||| k ab wo t‑uꞌapa g hewelkaj mo ab hebai al jewedag shuhdagi ch ed.”

<sax> At daybreak Paul urged all of them to eat something. “It's been fourteen days now that you haven't eaten anything because you've been so worried and preoccupied,” he told them. ||| Kuki eda mahsihim.

<sax> When he'd finished speaking he picked up a loaf of bread, and gave thanks to God for it in front of everyone. Then he broke the bread, and began to eat. ||| Neh, bat cheꞌiok am ha hekaj bei g pahn k ab si ihm g Jiosh wehs ha wehhejed k am hahawa i hahain k huh.
<sax> Everyone was encouraged and they ate too. ||| T wehsijj am i neidok ab si i e gewkemhun k am hahawa haꞌichu huh.
<sax> The total number of people on board was two hundred and seventy-six. ||| Kuch eda d gohk siant wewaꞌakko gamai chuhdp (276).

<sax> But they struck a sandbar and the ship grounded. The bow hit, and stuck so firm it couldn't be moved, while the stern began to be broken apart by the pounding surf. ||| T wabshaba ged hu si e hiash g wahlko moꞌo oꞌod ch ed mat koi am hu i wah.

<sax> But the centurion, because he wanted to save Paul's life, prevented them from doing this, and ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and make for land. ||| T wabshaba pi ha hiwigi g ha‑geꞌejig nat pi s‑doꞌibiam g Paul k am wehsijj ha chehani mat wo i e watchwihi am jewed koa wui.

<sax> When we were safe ashore, we discovered that we were on the island of Malta.  The people there were very kind—they started a fire and called all of us over so we could warm up from the rain and the cold. ||| Kuki am haꞌi d oꞌodham ch si s‑ap i e taht k ab i t‑neid k si s‑t‑nawojima.

<sax> Paul collected a bundle of firewood and threw it on the fire. But a poisonous snake was driven out of the bundle because of the heat and bit him, fastening itself on his hand. ||| T g Paul am haꞌi kuꞌa mat am wo si i mehmed g nahda k am toa mei ch ed.

<sax> When the people there saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to each other, “This man must be a murderer. Even though he escaped death from the sea, Justice won't let him live.” ||| T g kihkam am i nei ihda koꞌoi mo an kiꞌishch g Paul k hab kaij ab aꞌai e wui, “Id oki d ha muꞌakam ch hi wa chum pi e muhkid am shuhdagi ch ed.

<sax> Now Publius' father was sick, lying in bed suffering from fever and dysentery.

<sax> They made an appointment to meet with him. On that day many people came to where he was staying. From morning till night Paul was explaining to them, telling them about the kingdom of God. He tried to convince them about Jesus using the writings of the law of Moses and the prophets. ||| Neh, bo kaij. T am hahawa aꞌaga k kei g tash mat wo e jehnigi.
<sax> Some accepted what Paul said, but some refused to believe. ||| T haꞌi ab i s‑wohoch ab kaiok. T wabshaba haꞌijj pi shaꞌi wohoch.
<sax> They couldn't agree among themselves, and they left after Paul told them this: “The Holy Spirit said it well through Isaiah the prophet to your forefathers, ||| T am i pi shaꞌi e apꞌet k hab e juh mat wo aꞌai hihi. T hekaj id hab ep chei g Paul, “Do si wohokam mash wa has i kaij g Jiosh ab em‑amjed ab Isaiabad wui. K an hab chuꞌig Isaiabad oꞌohana ed:
<sax> For two full years Paul stayed there in the house he rented, welcoming everyone who came to see him. ||| K am kihkahim g Paul gohk ahid ab hema kih ed mo namkid ch am kih. K g hemajkam am chechga.
<sax> He spoke of the kingdom of God, and taught about the Lord Jesus Christ very boldly. No one prevented him. ||| K g Paul si s‑ap e tahtk ch ab ha neid ch am wabsh si s‑mahchim haꞌichu ha ahgid ab amjed g Jiosh kownaltalig ch ha mashcham ab amjed g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ.

<sax> We are always thankful to God the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ for you, and pray for you. ||| Chum ach hekid ab i hoꞌigeꞌid g Jiosh em-wehhejed t-hoꞌigeꞌidahunch.

<sax> that came to you just as it has gone throughout the whole world, spreading widely and bringing results. It's done the same for you too, ever since you heard it and realized the true nature of God's grace. ||| Am at em-wui jiwia ihda s-kehg haꞌichu ahga no pi an wehsko chehmohim g jewed ch am ha apꞌechudahim hegam mo ab kaiham hab masma mo hab em-wua.

<sax> He's also made clear to us your love in the Spirit. ||| Ia at hahawa jiwia k am t-ahgid mamsh ab aꞌai si e tatchua g gewkdajkaj g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag.
<sax> May you be made powerfully strong by his wonderful strength, having great patience and endurance. ||| Jiosh o wehs edgid g gewkdag. Kuch ab tahni mat baꞌich ab wo i em-mahkad g gewkdag. Mt hekaj wehs haꞌichu s-e tahtk ch wo nakogad ch wo si s-hehgigk.

<sax> through whom we have been set free and our sins forgiven. ||| T heg t-doꞌibia k gam hu hab i juh g pi ap t-chuꞌijig.
<sax> The Son is the visible picture of the invisible God. He was before  all creation, ||| Jiosh o pi ta neidagma ch wabshaba hemu e chehgidch gahi wuhshanim g e-alidag. Kutt hab waꞌi masma ab wo nei g Jiosh matt wo nei g alidaj. Heki o hu an wehmaj g e-ohg mat eda koi an hu haꞌichu e nahto ch wehs haꞌichu baꞌich d i si s-has haꞌichu.
<sax> for everything was created through him—in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, empires, rulers, leaders and authorities—everything was created through him and for him. ||| Jiosh at am i kei g e-alidag mat wehs haꞌichu wo nahto.

<sax> He existed before everything, and he holds everything together. ||| K wehs haꞌichu in hab chuꞌig g alidaj gewkdagkaj.

He is the beginning, the first and highest of those raised from the dead, so that he is supreme in everything. ||| K heg d t-moꞌo am himdam ahchim mach ab ihm.

<sax> You once were alienated from God, enemies in the way you thought and the way you acted, ||| Mehk am wa ab amjed g Jiosh ch d obgaj nam pi pi ap haꞌichu chegito ch pi ap haꞌichu hab junihim.
<sax> but now he has reconciled you through his dying human body, bringing you into his presence where you stand holy, pure, and faultless. ||| T wabshaba g Jiosh gam hu hab i juh g e-obgatalig k ab wabsh i chum em-hemakoj e wehm heg hekaj e-alidag muhkig.

<sax> But your trust in him must continue rock-solid and immovable. Don't be shaken from the hope of the good news that you heard, the good news that's been shared throughout the world—that's the work that I Paul have been doing. ||| mamtp am wabsh i s-gewkam wo wohochudad g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj ab amjed g alidaj ch pi gam hu hab wo i e juh ab amjed.

<sax> I'm happy to have trouble for your sake, for by means of what happens to me physically I'm part of Christ's sufferings that he continues to experience for the sake of his body, the church. ||| Bo sha mahs mach d honshpadaj g Christ ahchim mach ab ihm.

<sax> This is the mystery that was hidden down through the ages and for many generations, but it's now been revealed to God's people. ||| E o ehstokch ged hu i shohshon k amjed mat woho has wo t-juni g Christ. T wabshaba hemuch am si tashogi g Jiosh t-wui.

<sax> so that you may be encouraged. May you be bound together in love, experiencing the great benefit of being completely sure in your understanding, for this is what the true knowledge of God brings. May you know the revealed mystery of God, which is Christ!  In him you can discover all the rich wisdom and knowledge of God. ||| Jiosh o am chum wehs t-tashogid g e-amichudadag ch e-mahchig gahi wuhshanim g e-alidag.

<sax> Just as you accepted Christ Jesus as Lord, go on following him, ||| Ab amt i e dagito Jesus Christ wui mat d wo em-kownaligk. K d hahawa em-wuikam mamt ab wo wechok ch am wo himad g e-doakag ch wehmaj d wo hemakok.
<sax> grounded in him and built up by him. May your trust in him continue to grow strong, following what you were taught, full of gratitude to God. ||| An g behꞌi g e-gewkdag ab amjed mamt heg amjed baꞌich i s-gewkam ab wo wohochudad mam has i masma mashchamas ch chum hekid ab wo i mahkchid g e-hoꞌigeꞌidadag.
<sax> Watch out that nobody enslaves you through their philosophy and worthless delusions, following human traditions and concepts of this world, and not following Christ. ||| S-e g wo nenꞌoidk mat pi hedai wo em-iattogi.

<sax> For the fullness of God's divine nature lives in Christ in bodily form, ||| no pi heg d Jiosh am wehmaj g e-ohg, chum as hi wa hab masma ia jiwia mo g hemajkam.
<sax> and you have been made full in him. He is supreme over every ruler and authority. ||| Kumt am i e hemakoj g Christ wehm k wehmaj d hekiakam. K heg ab em-mahkch g wechij doakag ch d kownal am wehs ha dahm g kokownal am jewed dahm ch an dahm kahchim ch ed.
<sax> He stripped away the power of spiritual rulers and authorities, and having publicly revealed what they were truly like, he led them captive behind him in victory. ||| Jiawul o chum s-wulshpamk g Jiosh alidag. T wabshaba ab i e wulꞌo gewkdaj amjed k gewito t-wehhejed k hab masma wehs ha gewito g jijawul.
<sax> So don't let anyone criticize you for what you eat or what you drink, or regarding which religious festival, new moon ritual, or ceremonial sabbaths you choose to observe.  These are just a shadow of what was to come, for the physical reality is Christ. ||| Jiosh ash wa hab masma ha chehani g Tutuligo mat am wa has mahs haꞌichu hugi wo koꞌad ch am hab wo junihid g mihshmda piast.

K hahawa pi hab mahs machs am hab wo junihid hegai hab mahs haꞌichu k ch hekaj wo chum s-mahchk g Jiosh si Kehsha.
<sax> Don't let anyone cheat you out of your prize by insisting you have to beat yourself, or worship angels. They think they are better than anyone else because of visions they say they've had, and become ridiculously conceited in their sinful minds. ||| Haꞌi o hab e elid mo em-baꞌich i s-apꞌe natsh pi haꞌichu nei am e-nena ed ch hab chum kaij mamt pi wo e doꞌibia k hoꞌip ab i e shoꞌigchud k ab wo i has ha elidad g anghil.

<sax> Such people are not connected to the head that directs the body, nourished and joined together through the body's sinews and muscles. As the body is united together it grows the way God wants it to grow. ||| ch pi ab hu hiwig g Jiosh si Kehsha. K eda heg d t-moꞌo ch s-ap ab i t-dagioꞌid ch t-geꞌelid. Kuch ahchim ab ab giꞌi k ch ab ep aꞌai t-ab giꞌi hab masma mo g hon ch hab waꞌap masma i geꞌelhim.
<sax> If you died with Christ to the religious demands that this world insists upon,  why would you make yourself subject to such demands as if you were still part of this world? ||| Id o heg wa wepo matt heki hu koi nach pi d hemako heg wehm mat t-wehhejed muh. Heg at ab i t-wulꞌo heg amjed mo d wabsh hemajkam ha-mashchama. Pi g heg hekaj am haha wo i chum e apꞌechud Jiosh tahgio.
<sax> Things like: don't handle that, don't taste that, don't touch that! ||| Hegam mo em-kudut o ab chum em-chehani mamt pi an hu wo hudawgad ch jejkad ch tattamad haꞌichu i.
<sax> These commands refer to things that don't last since they're used up, and they're based on man-made requirements and teachings. ||| K wabshaba am wa s-apꞌe mamt wabsh wo hekaj mo haschu i s-apꞌe. T wabsh wo huhug e hekajk. Hegai mo d wabsh hemajkam ha-chehanig ch ha-mashchama
<sax> Such rules may make some kind of sense to those who practice self-centered piety, who are so proud of being humble, and who “mortify the body;” but in reality they don't help at all in dealing with sinful desires. ||| o pi woho d haꞌichu amichudadag.

<sax> You died, and your life is kept safe with Christ in God. ||| Jiosh at am i t-wehnadk g e-alidag. T heg heki hu muh k an hab chuꞌig dahm kahchim ch ed. K id heg wa wepo matt heki hu koꞌo k an wehmaj.
<sax> When Christ—your life—is revealed, then you will also share in his visible glory. ||| Ia at ep wo i wuhsh g Christ jewed dahm. Kutt am wehmaj wo i wuwhag k wepo masma wo si s-kehgajk.
<sax> So kill your worldly nature—sexual sin, immorality, lust, evil desires, greedily wanting to have more—this is the worship of idols. ||| Mt gam hu hab wo i juh g pi kehg e-tatchui ch pi kehg e-chegitoi k pi wo wehmaj woꞌiwua matp hedai pi d em-wehm kihkam k pi wo pihk e elidad mamt geꞌe haꞌichu wo bei.

<sax> Because of such things, those who disobey experience God's judgment. ||| S-koꞌok namkidadag at ab ha ab wo gei hegam mo hab masma haꞌichu hab junihim.
<sax> At one time you lived like that when you behaved in such a way, ||| Ahpim o wa an em-uꞌukch g pi kehg tatchui. Kum wa g pi apꞌekam hab junihim.
<sax> but now you should get rid of such things as anger, rage, wickedness, abuse, and using obscenities. ||| An o wa em-uꞌukch g bagatalig ch hehgamdadag ch kehꞌidadag. Mt wabshaba hemuch im hu wehs hab wo i juh ihda pi apꞌekam ab e amjed k pi hekid pad wo neokad
<sax> Don't lie to each other, since you've discarded your old self and what you used to do, ||| ch pi haꞌichu wo ha iattogidad. Wehs at mukito ihda hab mahs haꞌichu ab em-ab.
<sax> and put on your new self that is always being made more like your Creator, understanding better who he really is. ||| Ab amt i e dagito Jiosh wui. T heg ab em-mah g wechij doakag k em-tatchuid mamt wo wepo masmak ch ab wo s-ap s-mahchk.
<sax> Be patient with one another, forgive others among you if you have grievances against one another. Just as the Lord forgave you, you should do the same. ||| Jiosh at ab s-t-hoꞌigeꞌid k gam hu hab i juh g pi ap t-chuꞌijig. Kutt hab waꞌap wo s-ha bahbgi hegam mat hab wo juh g pi apꞌekam ab t-wui k hab waꞌap ab wo s-ha hoꞌigeꞌel.
<sax> Above all, love one another, which is the perfect bond that will hold you together. ||| Ab o t-ab matt aꞌai t-hekaj wo si pihk t-elidad ch hab s-ap d wo hemakok.
<sax> May the peace of Christ direct your thinking, because you were called to this by God who makes you one, and thank God for it! ||| Christ o ab em-makiog g s-ap tahhadkam.

<sax> Let Christ's message fully live in you. In every wise way teach and instruct one another through psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, graciously singing praise to God from your hearts. ||| Mt am wo s-chegitok g Christ haꞌichu ahga.

<sax> You married women, respect your husbands appropriately in the Lord. ||| Ahpim uꞌuwi mam ab ihm g Christ amt ab wo s-wohog ha elidad g e-wehm kihkam. Bo masma em-tatchuid g Jiosh.
<sax> You married men, love your wives and don't treat them badly. ||| Kumt ahpim chechoj wo si pihk e elidad ha hekaj g e-wehm kihkam ch ab wabsh wo i s-ha bahbgi.
<sax> You children, always do what your parents tell you because this is what pleases the Lord. ||| Ahpim aꞌal amt ab wo s-wohog ha elidad g e-jehj chum hekid. Id o d tatchuij g Jiosh.
<sax> Do whatever you do really well, as if you're doing it for God, and not for people,  because you know that the Lord will give you your reward—an inheritance! You're serving Christ the Lord! ||| Pi o d waꞌi oꞌodham mo em-chikpnachud ch wabshaba d t-kownalig Jesus. Ab o him g tash mamt an wo wehmajk. T heg ab wo em-namkid heg hekaj em-chikpan.

<sax> Remember to keep on praying, with an alert and thankful mind! ||| Ahpim wehs g chum hekid wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahunad ch ab ep wo i hoꞌigeꞌidad g Jiosh.
<sax> Pray for us too that God may open a door of opportunity to spread the message, to tell about the revealed mystery of Christ—which is the reason I'm here in prison. ||| Chum ach s-ahgamk g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ab amjed g alidaj. Kumt ab wo tai mat ab wo t-mah g apꞌedag matt hab wo t-juh. Dani lihso nani pi heg ahgachug.
<sax> Pray that I may make it as clear as I should when I speak. ||| Kumt ab wo tai g Jiosh mat hab wo ni-juh mant am si tasho wo ahgad.

<sax> Epaphras who is one of you and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends his greetings. He's always passionate in his prayers on your behalf, praying that you'll stand firm as grown-up Christians, totally convinced about everything as God would want.  For the record I can tell you that he's done a lot for you, and for those in Laodicea and Hierapolis as well. ||| K ia ep dak ch am i em-hoꞌigeꞌelid hegai em-wehm kihkam mo hab chehgig Epaphras.

<sax> Through him we gain salvation through his blood, the forgiveness of our sins as a result of his priceless grace ||| Heg ehꞌed at am e iawua kots t ab. Kut ab nako g s-koꞌok t-namkidadag mat gam hu hab wo i juh g pi ap t-chuꞌijig k wo t-doꞌibia. Si o geꞌej g Jiosh hemajimatalig ab t-wui.
<sax> that he so generously provided for us, together with all wisdom and understanding. ||| Ab o t-mahkch g haꞌichu mahchig ch haꞌichu amichudadag.
<sax> He revealed to us his previously-hidden will through which he was happy to pursue his plan ||| Pi o ta machima g Jiosh hab elida. T wabshaba heki hu am i apꞌech mat iaꞌi idani haha wo t-mahtchul.

<sax> why I never stop thanking God for you and remember you in my prayers. ||| Kuni heg hekaj chum hekid ab hoꞌigeꞌid g Jiosh.
<sax> I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the glorious Father, may give you a spirit of wisdom to see and know him as he really is. ||| Jiosh o d si geꞌe s-apꞌekam ch d ohgaj g t-kownalig Jesus Christ.

<sax> the glorious riches he promises as an inheritance to his trustworthy people. May you also understand God's amazing power ||| Mt ep wo s-mahchk mat wehs wo hekaj g e-gewkdag am t-wehhejed ahchim mach ab s-wohochud. K g gewkdaj si geꞌej.
<sax> that he demonstrated in raising Christ from the dead. God seated Christ at his right hand in heaven, ||| Am at wa chehgi g e-gewkdag id hekaj matki ab i wuhshad g e-alidag muhkig amjed k ab dai s-apkojed e-hugid ab an dahm kahchim ch ed
<sax> far above any other ruler, authority, power, or lord, or any leader with all their titles—not only in this world, but also in the coming world too.  God has made everything subject to the authority of Christ, and has given him the responsibility as head over everything for the church, ||| mat d wo kownalk wehs haꞌichu dahm. Dahm kahchim ch ed kokownal ch jewed dahm kokownal o wehsijj ab wecho g Jiosh alidag.
<sax> which is his body, filled full and made complete by Christ, who fills and brings everything to completion. ||| Ch ahchim d hemajkamgaj ch wehmaj d hemako hab sha masma mach d honshpadaj.

<sax> At one time you were dead in your sins and evil actions, ||| Heki am hu pi edgid ihda wechij doakag nam pi d pi ap chuꞌijkam ch pi ab hu kaiham g Jiosh.
<sax> But God in his generous mercy, because of the amazing love he had for us  even while we were dead in our sins, has made us alive together with Christ. Trusting in him has saved you! ||| Pi ach wa ab hu wohog elid g Jiosh ch gam hu gawulkdas ab amjed heg hekaj pi ap t-chuꞌijig.

<sax> For you've been saved by grace through trusting in him—it's not through yourselves, it's the gift of God! ||| Ab at i s-t-hoꞌigeꞌel g Jiosh k doꞌibia natt pi ab i s-wohoch. Pi att wo shaꞌi t-nako machs hejel wo t-doꞌibia. Chum hems g t-wohochudadag o d mahkigdaj.

<sax> So you who are “foreigners” humanly-speaking, called “uncircumcised” by those who are “circumcised” (which is only a procedure carried out by human beings), you need to remember ||| Am g wo s-chegitok ahpim gawul mahs hemajkam mam has i masma mamt eda koi ab hu i s-wohoch g Christ. Pi am wa pahl hikuchkas hab masma mach ahchim Tutuligo.
<sax> that once you had no relationship to Christ. You were barred as foreigners from being citizens of Israel, strangers to the covenant God had promised. You had no hope and you lived in the world without God. ||| K g Jiosh pi ab hu em-mahkch hegai mo haschu ab t-mahkch ch pi ab hu em-mahtchulid mat ia wo i wuhshad g e-alidag mat d wo si Kehshajk.

<sax> because through him we both gain access to the Father through the same Spirit. ||| K g Jiosh hab waꞌap ab em-mahkch g apꞌedag ahpim mamt hab waꞌap ab i s-wohochud k ab wui i e dagito. K hab waꞌap an em-uꞌukch g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag.
<sax> That means you're no longer strangers and foreigners; you are fellow citizens of God's people and belong to God's family ||| Pi am d haha wabsh mehkjed oꞌodham ch wabshaba d aꞌaligaj g Jiosh. K g Jiosh ab em-mahkch g apꞌedag am e-kihdag ed hab masma mo ahchim ab t-mahkch.

<sax> You too are being built together in him as a place for God to live by the Spirit. ||| Kuch wehsijj t-wehm si s-ap hab chuꞌig ch d s-apꞌekam cheopi no pi g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag am t-eda.
<sax> This is why, I, Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ for the sake of you foreigners, ||| Ia am ni-kuhpch nani pi ahgachug g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga am ha shahgid g nahnko mahs hemajkam. Kuni am ni-hoꞌigeꞌidahun Jiosh wui em-wehhejed nam pi d ni-wehm wohochuddam.
<sax> (well, I'm assuming you've heard that God gave me the specific responsibility of sharing God's grace with you), ||| Am amtp hu waꞌi kah mo ab ni-wui si s-hemajima g Jiosh ch ab ni-mah ihda chikpan mant hekaj wo i em-wehmajk.
<sax> how, by what God showed me, made clear the mystery that was previously hidden. I wrote to you briefly before about this, ||| Am at i ni-chehgi g s-aꞌagi e-apchuda mant ia heꞌes hekaj em-oꞌohani.
<sax> that foreigners are joint heirs, part of the same body, and in Christ Jesus share together in the promise through the good news. ||| Ihda s-aꞌagi haꞌichu ahga o hab chuꞌig mam ahpim gawul mahs hemajkam ab hahawa t-wehm apꞌedag ahchim Tutuligo id eda Jiosh hoꞌigeꞌidalig.

<sax> I became a minister of this good news through the gift of God's grace that I was given by his power that was at work in me. ||| Kuni ahni d em-pionag ch am em-ahgid ihda s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh. Heg at si s-ni-hoꞌigeꞌid k am i ni-kehsh k ab ni-mah g gewkdag mant wo em-ahgi.
<sax> This grace was given to me, the least important of all Christians, in order to share with the foreigners the incredible value of Christ, ||| Shahag wepo mani ahni wehs ha baꞌich d wabsh pi haꞌichu am ha shahgid g Jiosh hemajkamga.

<sax> and to help everyone see the purpose of the mystery which from the very beginning was hidden in God who made everything. ||| Id o d ni-chikpan mant am wo i ha tashogi g hemajkam mo has masma hab chuꞌig ihda s-aꞌagi haꞌichu apchudaj g Jiosh.

<sax> God's plan was that the various aspects of his wisdom would be revealed through the church to the rulers and authorities in heaven. ||| nat pi iaꞌi idani wo ha chehgi g anghil kokownal g muꞌi nahnko mahs haꞌichu e-amichudadag am gai t-wuhshanim ahchim mat t-doꞌibia.
<sax> This was in accordance with God's eternal purpose that he carried out in Christ Jesus our Lord. ||| Jiosh at am hab juh ihda gahi wuhshanim g t-kownalig Jesus Christ mat has i masma apꞌech ga hu i wehpeg.
<sax> Because of him and our trust in him we can come to God in total freedom and confidence. ||| Kuch apꞌedag matt si s-gegokim ab wo i miabi g Jiosh ab s-wohochudch g haꞌichu ahgaj ab amjed g alidaj.
<sax> So I'm asking that you don't get discouraged that I'm suffering—it's for you and you should value that! ||| Ab ani shoak em-wui mamt am wabsh wo si i e gewpkad k pi has wo e tahtkkad mani ni-shoꞌigchud em-wehhejed. Wehs o d wabsh em-apꞌedag ihda ni-shoꞌigdag.
<sax> asking him that out of his wealth of glory he may strengthen you in your innermost being with power through his Spirit. ||| Wehs o edgid g gewkdag g Jiosh ch geꞌe ab t-makiog. Kuni ab tahni mat baꞌich ab wo i em-mah. Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag o am t-eda haꞌichug ch ab t-makiog g Jiosh gewkdag.
<sax> May Christ live in your hearts as you trust in him, so that as you are planted deep in love, ||| Id o heg wa wepo mo g Christ am t-eda kih. Ab ani tahni g Jiosh mamt chum hekid hab wo masmak mo g Christ ch wo si pihk e elidad ab wehs ha wui.
<sax> you may have the power to comprehend with all God's people the breadth and length and height and depth of Christ's love.  May you know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, so that you're made full and complete by the fullness of God. ||| Shoꞌo waꞌi si geꞌej g Christ tatchuidag ab t-wui.

<sax> Now may he who—through his power working in us—can do infinitely more than we ever ask for or even think about, ||| Jiosh at wo e nako mat baꞌich i geꞌe haꞌichu hab wo t-juni mach hems heꞌes ab i chum tahni o hems heꞌes i chegitod. Heg o hekaj hab t-junid e-gewkdag mo am chikpan t-eda.
<sax> may he be glorified in the church and in Christ Jesus through all generations for ever and ever. Amen. ||| Kutt chum hekid ab wo hehgchulidad ahchim mach d hemako g t-kownalig Jesus Christ wehm.
<sax> So I—this prisoner in the Lord—am encouraging you to make sure you live according to the principles to which you were called. ||| Dani lihso heg hekaj mani ahgachug g haꞌichu ahga ab amjed g t-kownalig Jesus. Kuni ab si s-em-hoꞌigeꞌidam am em-ahgid mamt hab wo masmak mo has masma g Jiosh em-tatchuid ch ab i em-gawulkai.
<sax> Don't think proudly of yourselves; be gentle and patient, showing tolerance to each other in love. ||| Pi g am wo chum si e haꞌichuchudad ch wabshaba wo s-hehemajimak ch chum hekid ab wo s-e bahbgik ch ab aꞌai wo e tatchuad. Am g wo e chehgidad mam ab aꞌai e tatchua.
<sax> Make every effort to remain one in the Spirit through the peace that binds you together. ||| Ab at i t-hemakoch g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag. Pegih, mt wo si s-ap e tahtkkad ab aꞌai e wui mamt pi gam hu aꞌai wo i e gaꞌagwulkai.
<sax> there's one God and Father of everyone. He is over all and through all and in all. ||| Dach hemako no pi g Jiosh d waꞌi hemako ch wehsijj d t-ohg ch wehs t-dahm d kownal ch an wehsko hab chuꞌig ch am ep wehsijj t-eda haꞌichug.
<sax> To each of us grace was given in proportion to Christ's generous gift. ||| Christ at wehsijj ab i t-mahkhi hegai matt hekaj ab aꞌai wo i t-wehmajk.
<sax> As Scripture says, “When he ascended to the heights he took captives with him, and gave gifts to humanity.” ||| Bo chuꞌig g Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana:
<sax> We shouldn't be little children any more, tossed about and blown along by every passing breeze of doctrine, confused by human trickery, led into error by crafty people who deceitfully scheme; ||| Pi att hab haha wo masmak mo g aꞌal machs in has aꞌai gawul wo junihid g t‑wohochudadag. T hab pi wo e nako hegam mo am nahnko masma e nakog mat wo t‑iattogi.
<sax> instead by speaking the truth in love we ought to grow up in everything into Christ, who is our head. ||| Am att wo ahgad g wohokam ab pihk t‑elidch ha wui ch am wo i geꞌegeꞌehogat matt hab wo masmak mo g Christ. Heg o wa wepo mo g Christ d t‑moꞌo.
<sax> It's because of him that the whole body operates, every joint holding it together as each individual part does what it's supposed to, and the whole body grows, building itself up in love. ||| Ch ahchim d honshpadaj mach ab wui t‑dagitokch ch s‑ap t‑wehm chikpan hab masma mach nahnko mahs d chuhchuꞌidaj. Batt waꞌi masma am wo i geꞌegeꞌehogat t‑wohochudadag ed matt ab aꞌai wo si t‑tatchuad ch am wo i t‑wehmajk.
<sax> So let me say this to you—in fact I insist on it in the Lord—that you should no longer live like the foreigners do, in their empty-headed way. ||| Pi g am hu ha oidk hab wo masmak hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh. Id o d t‑kownalig Jesus chehanig. Hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh o wabsh pehegi haꞌichu chegito
<sax> In the darkness of their minds they don't understand, and they have been cut off from the life of God because they don't know anything and in their stubbornness they don't want to know. ||| ch pi haꞌichu aꞌamichud ch ep pi chechkaidag. Id o heg wa wepo mo am s‑chuhugam k ed hihim. K g Jiosh heg hekaj pi ab hu ha mahkch g wechij doakag.
<sax> So get rid of your former lifestyle, that old nature that ruins you through deceptive desires! ||| Im g hu hab wo i juhni g pi ap e‑tatchui. Heg o wa em‑iattogid ch em‑padchud.
<sax> Let yourselves be re-made spiritually and mentally, ||| T wabshaba g Jiosh am hab wo em‑juh mat g em‑tatchui ch em‑doakag d wo hekia s‑apꞌekamk.
<sax> and put on your new nature that God created so you will be like him, right and holy in the truth. ||| Jiosh o ab t‑mahkch g wechij doakag.

<sax> So reject lies, and tell the truth to each other—for we belong to each other. ||| Dach t‑wehm wohochuddam ch heg wa wepo mach d Christ honshpadag. K pi hab chum mahs machs aꞌai wo t‑iattogidad o hedai i ehp. Am g hab wo kaijjid g wohokam.
<sax> Don't sin by getting angry; don't let evening come and find you still mad— ||| Hemho wa amt wo babgat ab pi apꞌekam wui k wabshaba pi heg hekaj hab wo juh g pi apꞌekam. S‑hohtam g wo dagito g e‑bagatalig.
<sax> and don't give the devil any opportunity. ||| T hab pi wo e nako g Jiawul mas am hab wo em‑juh mamt hab wo juh g pi apꞌekam.
<sax> Thieves, stop your stealing, and do honest, productive work with your hands, so you'll have something to give to those who need it. ||| T wo haꞌasa haꞌichu ha ehs hegam matp hedai haꞌichu ha ehsid. Ab o hab waꞌap ha ab mat wo chikpanad ch heg amjed ab wo edgidad mat haschukaj am wo i ha wehmt g shoꞌigkam.
<sax> Don't use bad language. Speak words that will encourage people as necessary, so that those who listen will be helped. ||| Pi g am wo pi kehg neneokad ch wabshaba wo s‑ap neneokad ch ab aꞌai wo i e gewkemhunad. T g em‑neꞌoki hab masma d wo i ha wehmtadagk hegam mat hedai wo i em‑kahkad.
<sax> Be kind and compassionate to each other, forgiving one another, just as God in Christ forgave you. ||| Jiosh at im hu hab i juh g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig matt ab i s‑wohoch g Christ. Kumt ahpim hab wa masma ab aꞌai wo s‑e hoꞌigeꞌidad ch im hu hab wabsh wo i juh matp hema i chum s‑koꞌokam has wo em‑juh.
<sax> So then, imitate God since you're his much-loved children. ||| Ab o si t‑tatchua g Jiosh. Kutt am oidch hab wo t‑junihid nach pi d aꞌaligaj.
<sax> Live in love, just as Christ loved you. He gave himself for us, a gift and sacrificial offering to God like a sweet-smelling perfume. ||| Christ o am hab junihim g e‑ohg Jiosh tatchui ch ab si t‑tatchua ch am t‑wehhejed e muhkid. Kutt ahchim hab waꞌap ab aigo wo si tatchuad ch ab aꞌai wo si t‑tatchuad.
<sax> Sexual immorality or any kind of indecency or greed should never be mentioned concerning you, as God's people should not be doing such things. ||| Dach Jiosh hemajkamga. K pi hab chum mahs machs wo ha wehm woꞌiwua matp hedai pi d t‑wehm kihkam o achs wo chegito g s‑uam haꞌichu o achs wo s‑behim matp haschu pi ab hu d t‑wuikam.
<sax> Obscene talk, stupid chatter, and coarse jokes are totally inappropriate—instead you should be thanking God.  You know it's absolutely sure that no-one who is sexually immoral, or commits indecency, or who is greedy, or is an idol-worshiper will inherit anything in the kingdom of Christ and God. ||| S‑mahch am mat pi am hu wo i ha wahpki g Jiosh hegam mo hab wa masma.

<sax> Don't let anyone fool you with lying words, for it's because of such things that God's judgment is passed on the children of disobedience. ||| Haꞌi oki hab kaij mo am wa s‑apꞌe hegam mo hab masma hab e junihim. Kumt wabshaba pi ab hu wo kaiha g pehegi ha‑neꞌoki. Jiosh at hemho wa s‑koꞌokam wo ha namkid hegam mat pi ab hu wo s‑wohog el.
<sax> So don't partner with them in this. ||| An g hu wabsh wo ha neidad hegam hab mahs hemajkam ch pi am hu ha oidch hab wo e junihid.
<sax> At one time you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. You are to live as children of light ||| Ahpim amsh hab waꞌap masma heki hu.

<sax> Don't have anything to do with the pointless things that darkness produces—instead expose them.  It's shameful even to speak about the things such people do secretly, ||| Pi amt am hu wo ha wehmajk hegam mo hab junihim g pi apꞌekam. Dat wo s‑ta edam haꞌichuk mamt chum hems heg ab wo neneokad mo haschu s‑aꞌagi hab wua idam. Kumt wabshaba wo ha ahgi mo pi ap hab e junihim.
<sax> but when anything is exposed by the light then it's revealed as it is. Light makes everything visible.  That's why it's said, “Wake up, those of you who are sleeping, rise up from the dead, and Christ will shine on you.” ||| T haha wo s‑e mahchk mo has chuꞌig. Bo d ahga ihda cheꞌidag mo hab chuꞌig:
<sax> So be careful how you live your life, not foolishly, but wisely, ||| Am g wo si s‑e nenꞌoidk mamt has masma wo himchudad g e‑doakdag ch pi hab wo masmak mam d wabsh pi haꞌichu aꞌamichuddam.

<sax> So don't be ignorant—find out what the Lord's will is. ||| Jiosh o am em‑wui tashogid g e‑tatchui. Am g wo si i aꞌamichud k wo s‑mai mo haschu wud.
<sax> Don't get drunk on wine which will wreck your life, but be filled with the Spirit. ||| Pi g wo nawkkad namt pi heg hekaj wo padch g e‑doakag mamt pi wo e doꞌibia. Am g wehs wo i e dagitokchid Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag wui. T heg an wo em‑uꞌukchid ch ab wo em‑mahkchid g si geꞌe s‑ap tahhadkam.

<sax> Always thank God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. ||| ch chum hekid ab wo hoꞌigeꞌidad g Jiosh t‑ohg wehs haꞌichukaj am chehchegch g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ.
<sax> The husband is head of the wife in the same way as Christ is head of the church—his body and its savior. ||| Kun o gewkdag am dahm g e‑hohnig hab masma mo g Christ gewkdag am t‑dahm ahchim mach ab ihm ch ab si hiwig. Ahchim ach heg wa wepo mach d honshpadaj. K heg d t‑doꞌibiakam.
<sax> In the same way that the church does what Christ says, wives should do what their husbands tell them in all things. ||| Ab att wehs wo i chum t‑dagitokch wui. Kumt ahpim uꞌuwi hab wa masma wehs ab wo i chum e dagitokch e‑kuhkun ha wui.
<sax> Husbands, you should love your wives in the same way as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it. ||| Ahpim chechoj amt hab masma ab wo si ha tatchuad g e‑hohonig mo g Christ ab si t‑tatchua. Heg o haꞌas geꞌe ab si t‑tatchua mat am t‑wehhejed e dagito mamt wo mua.

<sax> so that he could make the church his own, with no flaw or blemish or any kind of fault, but holy and blameless. ||| e wehhejed matt d wo hekia s‑apꞌekam enigajk.
<sax> Husbands should love their wives just like this, as they love their own bodies. A man who loves his wife loves himself— ||| Kumt ahpim chechoj ab wo si ha tatchuad g e‑hohonig hab masma mam ab si hejel e tatchua no pi heg wa wepo mam d hemako e wehm. Hejel e hekaj o si pihk e elid matp hedai g e‑hohnigkaj si pihk e elid no pi d waꞌi hemako.
<sax> for no one ever hated his own body, but feeds it and looks after it, just as Christ does for the church,  for we are parts of his body. ||| Pi o hekid hedai hejel s‑e kehꞌid ch wabshaba am i e nakog mat wo e gegosidad ch wo e nuhkudad.

<sax> Masters, you should treat your servants the same way. Don't threaten them, remember that the Lord in heaven is both their master and yours, and he treats people the same, without favoritism. ||| Ahpim mam d aꞌamo amt wo s‑ap i ha nuhkudad g e‑pionag ch pi wo ha ebkiodad.

<sax> I'm shocked at how quickly you're abandoning the God who by the grace of Christ called you. You are turning to a different kind of good news ||| Jiosh o ab t-mahkch g e-hoꞌigeꞌidadag am gahi wuhshanim g e-alidag. Kunt si ni-tods mamtsh s-hohtam dagito g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj k ab s-wohoch g gawul haꞌichu ahga.

<sax> But if anyone, even we ourselves, or even an angel from heaven, should promote any other kind of good news  than what we have already told you, let them be condemned!  I repeat what we've told you before: if anyone promotes any other kind of good news than what you've already accepted, let them be condemned! ||| T wabshaba g Jiosh am wo ha lodait k s-koꞌokam wo ha namkid.

<sax> Whose approval do you think I want—that of people, or of God? Do you think I'm trying to please people? If I wanted to please people I wouldn't be a servant of Christ! ||| Tp hems pi wo hohhoꞌi g hemajkam mani has kaij. Ni eda pi hab ahgch hab kaij mas g hemajkam wo s-hohhoꞌi.

<sax> You heard how I behaved as a follower of the Jewish religion—how I fanatically persecuted God's church, savagely trying to destroy it. ||| Dani Tuhligo. Kumki heki hu kah mani wa hab masma ab ihm g Jiosh mo g ni-wehm oꞌodham ch si ha shoꞌigchud hegam mo ab ihm g Jesus ch am chum s-keshwuimk g ha-hehemapda.
<sax> I surpassed my contemporaries in the practice of the Jewish religion because I was so fervently devoted to the traditions of my ancestors. ||| Dani wa si s-has haꞌichu am t-himdag ed muꞌi ha baꞌiwechkim g ni-wepo geꞌedam nanid pi baꞌich i s-gewkam oid g t-himdag.
<sax> But when God (who had set me apart from birth) called me through his grace, and was pleased ||| T wabshaba g Jiosh s-ni-hoꞌigeꞌid k am heki hu i apꞌech mant eda koi mahsi mant d wo piongajk.
<sax> to reveal his Son to me so that I could announce the good news to the nations, I didn't discuss this with anyone. ||| T am hebai i cheka.

<sax> I didn't go to Jerusalem to talk to those who preceded me as apostles; instead I left for Arabia, and then later returned to Damascus. ||| Ab o dadha g Jesus Christ chuhchai Jerusalem kihhim t ab am Judea jewed ch ed ch am ahgachug g haꞌichu ahgaj. Nt wabshaba pi am hu shaꞌi hih manis hekaj wo ha neid k wo ha wehm neo. Im ant hu hab wabsh hih Arabia jewed wui k am hahawa ep uhpam hih Damascus kihhim wui.
<sax> After three years I went to Jerusalem to visit Peter. I stayed with him for two weeks. ||| Am o d i waik aꞌahidag dahm, nt am hih Jerusalem wui k ab haꞌichu wo kakke g Peter k am wehmaj dakahim gohk domig ab.
<sax> I didn't see any other apostles except James, the Lord's brother. ||| M ant waꞌi hemako ep nei g Jesus kehsha. K heg d James ch d wehngaj g Jesus.
<sax> (Let me assure you before God that I'm not lying about what I'm writing to you!) ||| Jiosh o s-mahch mo d wohokam ihda mani em-ahgid.
<sax> They had only heard people say, “The man who used to persecute us is now spreading the faith he once tried to destroy!” ||| Idam wabsh kah mo haꞌi hab kaij, “Hegai mo wa t-shoꞌigchud o am hahawa ahgachug ihda Jesus haꞌichu ahga mo wa heki hu chum s-keshwuimk.”
<sax> —and they praised God because of me. ||| Neh, bash kaij ch ab si ihm g Jiosh am i kaiok mat am gawul i ni-juh.
<sax> Fourteen years later I returned to Jerusalem with Barnabas. I took Titus along with me. ||| Am him k am d i wehst-mahm aꞌahidag, nt am hih Jerusalem wui wehmaj g Barnabas. Tt am hema i bei g gawul mahs oꞌodham. K id hab chehgig Titus.
<sax> I went because of what God had shown me.  I met with the recognized church leaders there in private and explained to them the good news I was sharing with the foreigners. I didn't want the course I had followed, and what I was working so hard for, to come to nothing. ||| Jiosh o wa ab ni-chehgid mant am wo him k wo ha nei hegam mo am d ha wanimeddam g Jesus ihmdam. Kutt am ha wehm t-nam. Ni am ha ahgid mani haschu i ahgachug am ha-shahgid g gawul mahs hemajkam nani pi s-gihug matp hems haꞌi wo padch g ni-chikpan.
<sax> But as it turned out, nobody even insisted that Titus who was with me should be circumcised, though he was Greek.  (That issue only arose because some false Christians slipped in to spy on the freedom we have in Christ Jesus, trying to make us slaves.  We never gave into them, not even for a moment. We wanted to make sure to keep the truth of the good news unchanged for you.) ||| K am haꞌi haꞌichug hegam mo chum s-em-wupulshpamk ahpim gawul mahs hemajkam hab em-elidch mant hemho wa am hab wo junihid g heki hu t-himdag ahchim Tutuligo.

Neh, bach wa masma s-ap nuhkud ihda s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh mach am em-wui ahgachug.
<sax> But those considered to be important didn't add anything  to what I said. (It doesn't concern me what kind of leaders they were, because God doesn't judge people the way we do.) ||| Do wabsh ni-wehm wohochuddam hegam mo am d ha wanimeddam ch pi haꞌichu wechij ab hu ni-ahgid. Pi ani si has ha elid. Wehsijj ach t-wepo d hahaꞌichu am Jiosh tahgio.
<sax> On the contrary, once they realized that I'd been given responsibility to share the good news with the foreigners just as Peter had been given the responsibility to share the good news with the Jews,  (for the same God  who worked through Peter as apostle to the Jews also worked through me as apostle to the foreigners), ||| K hegam hab kaij matki g Jiosh am hab waꞌap i ni-kei hab masma mat am i kei g Peter. Heg o d kehshaj ch am ahgachug g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj ha wui g Tutuligo. Ni ahni hab waꞌap d kehshaj ch am ahgachug ha wui g gawul mahs hemajkam. K g Jiosh wepo ab t-mahkch g gewkdag.
<sax> and once they recognized the grace that had been given to me, then James, Peter, and John, who bore the responsibility of church leadership, shook Barnabas and me by the hand as their fellow-workers. ||| Bamki ha elid hegam James ch Peter ch John mo d ha wanimeddam. T idam am wohokamch mat g Jiosh ab ni-mah ihda chikpan k t-nowi-bebhe. Kutt am i t-apꞌech ab t-wui mat hegam am wo ahgachugad g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga Tutuligo hemajkam ha wui. Nt ahni hi g Barnabas wehm gawul mahs hemajkam ha wui wo ahgachugad.
<sax> As well as Peter, other Jewish Christians became hypocritical too, to the extent that even Barnabas was persuaded to follow their hypocrisy. ||| K hegam ehp mo hab waꞌap d Tutuligo hab waꞌap e wua mo g Peter, chum wa hems g Barnabas.
<sax> When I realized that they weren't taking a firm stand for the truth of the good news, I said to Peter in front of everyone, “If you're a Jew yet live like the foreigners and not like Jews, why are you forcing the foreigners to live like Jews? ||| Ni am ha neid mo pi am hu shaꞌi ap hab junihim g e-wohochudadag ch hab kaij ab wui g Peter am ha kaichudch, “Neh, Peter, dap Tuhligo ch wabshaba hahawa pi am hu hab junihim hegai t-himdag mo wa g Jiosh ab t-chehani. Pegih, p haschu ahgch hab e elid mapt pi wo ha hajunimak g goꞌol hemajkam, t hoꞌip am hab i junihi g t-chehanig?”
<sax> We may be Jews by birth, and not ‘sinners’ like the foreigners, ||| Ahchim Tutuligo ach wa hab chum t-elid mach pi hab masma pi apꞌe mo g goꞌol hemajkam.
<sax> but we know that nobody is made right by doing what the law demands—it is only through trusting in Jesus Christ. We have trusted in Christ Jesus so that we could be made right by placing our confidence in Christ, and not through doing what the law says—because nobody is made right by observing the requirements of the law.” ||| T wabshaba am i t-chehgi g Jiosh mat pi hedai wo e nako mas am tahgio hejel wo i e apꞌech am hab junihidch g chehanig. Bo d elidaj matt ab wo i s-wohoch g haꞌichu ahgaj k ab wo i hiwigi g Jesus Christ. T heg am tahgio wo i t-apꞌech. Pegih, tt heg am hab waꞌi juh k am i t-apꞌech.
<sax> For if, as we look to be made right in Christ, we ourselves prove to be sinners, does that then mean that Christ is in the service of sin?  Of course not! ||| Am att i s-mai mach d pi ap chuꞌijkam am i s-mahchk ab amjed g Christ. Pi at heg hab t-juh machs d pi ap chuꞌijkam
<sax> For if I were to rebuild what I've destroyed, then I only demonstrate I'm a law-breaker. ||| k wabshaba am i t-apꞌech Jiosh tahgio. Kutt d wo pi ap chuꞌijkamk mattp wo chum s-t-apchudam g chehanigkaj.
<sax> For through the law I died to the law in order that I could live for God. ||| Chehanig o s-hasig. Kutt pi wo t-nako machs am oidk hab wo t-junihid ch am wo i t-apꞌech. Nt heg hekaj am i ni-dagito Jiosh wui mat am wo i ni-apꞌech k am hahawa d wo doakamk wehhejed.
<sax> I've been crucified with Christ— so it's no longer I who lives, but it is Christ living in me. The life I now live in this body, I live by trusting in the Son of God, who loved me, and who gave himself for me. ||| Jiosh alidag o ab si pihk e elid t-hekaj ch ab nako g s-koꞌok muhkig ab kots t ab am t-wehhejed mat heg hekaj ab wo i t-mah g wechij doakag. Kuch heg hekaj ab hiwig ch d dodakam am nenaj ed ch am wehhejed.
<sax> So tell me—did you receive the Spirit by keeping the law, or by placing your trust in what you heard? ||| Ab amt i s-wohoch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. T g Jiosh ab em-mah g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag.
<sax> You really have lost your heads! You began living  in the Spirit. Do you really think you can now make yourselves perfect by your own human efforts? ||| Kut heg s-ap i shonwuich g em-wechij doakag. Pegih, m haschu ahgch hahawa pi hiwig mat baꞌich wo i himad g em-doakag. Pi amt wo e nako mamt s-ap wo nahto g e-doakag g hejel e-gewkdagkaj.
<sax> Did you go through so much suffering for nothing? (It really wasn't for nothing was it?) ||| Muꞌi am haꞌichukaj e shoꞌigchud am wehhejed g Jiosh alidag. T g em-shoꞌigdag wo e nahnkogi mamt wo sha dagito g Jiosh alidag.
<sax> Let me ask you: does God give you the Spirit and do so many miracles among you because you keep the law, or is it because you trust in what you heard? ||| Ab amt si i s-wohoch g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh. T heg hekaj ab em-mah g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag mat wo em-wehmajk k hab ep wua g s-hasig haꞌichu am em-shahgid. Pi at hab ahgk hab e juh ihda mams am hab si junihim g Tutuligo ha-chehanig.
<sax> It's just like Abraham who “trusted God, and was considered to be right.” ||| An o hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed:
<sax> In Scripture it's foreseen that God would make right the foreigners who trusted in him. The good news is revealed to Abraham beforehand with the words, “Through you all the nations will be blessed.” ||| Kekelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam o heki hu s‑mahch ch an oꞌoha mat g Jiosh am hab wo ha juh g goꞌol hemajkam mat ab wo i s‑wohochud k wo i e apꞌech am tahgio. Kush hab kaij g Jiosh am wui g Abrahambad:
<sax> All those who rely on keeping the law  are under a curse, for as Scripture says, “Cursed is everyone who doesn't carefully obey everything that's written in the book of the law.” ||| An o hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed:
<sax> Clearly nobody is made right with God by attempting to keep the law, for “Those who are made right will live by trusting God.” ||| K wabshaba an oꞌohanas:
<sax> Let me explain. The law, coming four hundred and thirty years later, doesn't cancel the previous covenant that God made, breaking the promise. ||| Kut pi shaꞌi gawul juh g haꞌichu e‑ahga g Jiosh mat hekid ab i t‑mah ahchim Tutuligo g t‑chehanig mo idani d waꞌi giꞌik siant waikko wehst‑mahm (430) ahidag amjed.
<sax> If the inheritance is derived from obedience to the law, it no longer comes from the promise. But God graciously gave it to Abraham by means of the promise. ||| Jiosh at wo ha doꞌibia g hemajkam hab masma mat doꞌibia g Abrahambad mat wa hab masma ab ha ahꞌad haꞌichu. Id at wo em‑doꞌibia mamtp ab wo i s‑wohoch, k pi hegai chehanig.
<sax> What was the point of the law, then? It was added to show what wrongdoing really is, until the son came to whom the promise had been made. The law was put in place by angels through the hand of a mediator. ||| K wabshaba am wa haꞌichu wehhejed s‑apꞌe hegai chehanig. Heg o hekaj tasho mo haschu d pi apꞌekam. K hab d elidaj g Jiosh matt an wo uꞌukchid ihda chehanig am hugkam mat in wo i wuhsh g alidaj. Am ash ha ahgid g Jiosh g chehanig am gahi wuhshanim g anghil.
<sax> But a mediator isn't needed when there's only one person involved. And God is one! ||| Kush hema g oꞌodham am ha wehhejed neok g Jiosh ch hemajkam matsh eda am i apꞌech hegai chehanig. Sh wa eda g Jiosh si hejel am ahgid g Abrahambad g haꞌichu e‑ahꞌada.
<sax> So does the law work against God's promises? Of course not! For if there was a law that could give life, then we could be made right by keeping it. ||| Pi o ab hu wui kehk g Jiosh haꞌichu ahꞌada g chehanigaj. Mattp wo sha t‑nako machs wehs oidch am hab wo t‑junihid g Jiosh chehanig, t wabsh wo t‑hiwigi g Jiosh matt heg hekaj wo t‑doꞌibia. K wabshaba pi hab shaꞌi mahs. Heg at hekaj wo t‑doꞌibia g Jiosh mo has i masma ab haꞌichu t‑ahꞌad.
<sax> But Scripture tells us that we all are prisoners of sin. The only way we can receive God's promises is by trusting in Jesus Christ. ||| An o hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed mo wehs hemajkam d pi ap chuꞌijkam ch pi wo shaꞌi e nako mas hejel wo e doꞌibia. T heg hekaj wo ha doꞌibia g Jiosh k ab wo i ha mah g pi ha huhugedam doakag hegam mat ab wo hiwgad g alidaj.
<sax> Before we trusted in Jesus we remained in the custody of the law until this way of trusting was revealed. ||| An o wabsh t‑shohbidch g Jiosh g e‑chehanigkaj am hugkam mat ab i t‑chehgi matt ab wo i s‑wohoch g haꞌichu ahgaj k wo t‑doꞌibia.
<sax> The law was our guardian until Christ came, so that we could be made right by trusting him. ||| T‑mashchamahim o g e‑chehanigkaj matt has wo chum masmak ch ab wo ai matt ab wo i hiw g alidaj. Kut heg am wo i t‑apꞌech Jiosh tahgio mattp ab hiwig.
<sax> There's no longer Jew or Greek, slave or free, male or female—you are all one in Christ Jesus. ||| K g Jiosh wehs t‑wepo masma t‑neid ahchim mach ab s‑wohochud. Ahpim gawul mahs hemajkam am t‑wepo d haꞌichu ahchim Tutuligo am Jiosh tahgio. K g nenehol t‑wepo d haꞌichu ahchim mach pi d nenehol. K g uꞌuwi t‑wepo d haꞌichu ahchim chechoj. Wehsijj ach ab i t‑hemakochud ahchim mach an uꞌukch g Jesus Christ.
<sax> If you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's children, and you are heirs of the promise! ||| Kuch d hemajkamgaj ch heg hekaj hab waꞌi masma mach d amjedkamaj g Abrahambad ch wo bei hegai mat haschu g Jiosh am i apꞌech wehhejed.
<sax> Let me explain what I'm saying. An heir who is under-age is no different from a slave, even though the heir may be the owner of everything. ||| Chum as wehs d wo enigajk g ali g ohgaj haꞌichu eniga, t eda pi wo bei t hoꞌip am i geꞌeda.
<sax> An heir is subject to guardians and managers until the time set by the father. ||| Mt wo nuhkudad g ali ch ep wo nuhkudad hegai mat haschu d wo enigajk am hugkam mat wo ai g e‑geꞌelig.
<sax> It's just the same for us. When we were children, we were slaves subject to the basic rules of the law. ||| Kuch wa ahchim hab wa masma mo g aꞌal nat pi g Jiosh kei g e‑chehanig mat hekaj wo t‑nuhkud am hugkam matt ab wo i s‑wohoch g haꞌichu ahgaj.
<sax> But at the appropriate time God sent his Son, born of a woman, born under the rule of law, ||| T am i s‑ap e ai, t g Jiosh ab i ahꞌad g e‑alidag. Kut ab mahsi k wepo e juh g hemajkam k am i geꞌelhim k am hab junihim hegai chehanig mo g Jiosh ab ha mahkch g Tutuligo.
<sax> so that he could rescue those who were kept under the rule of law, so that we could receive the inheritance of adopted children. ||| Ab ach wa t‑abchud g t‑chuꞌijig ab chehanig wecho. Kut ia jiwia g Jiosh alidag jewed dahm mat wo t‑doꞌibia am t‑wehhejed nakogk g s‑koꞌok t‑namkidadag matt d haha wo aꞌaligajk g Jiosh.
<sax> To show you are his children, God sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, causing us to call out, “Abba,” meaning “Father.” ||| T g Jiosh heg hekaj ab t‑mah g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag mat wo t‑wehmajk. Kuch hab d aꞌaligaj ch ab ihm ch hab kaij, “Jiosh t‑ohg”.
<sax> But now you've come to know God—or better, to be known <span class="it">by</span> God. So how can you go back to those useless and worthless rules? Do you want to be slaves to those rules all over again? ||| Pegih, m haschu ahgch am uhpam ha wui ep s‑hihimimk mamt d ep wo ha‑neneholigak hemu mam eda am wa chum s‑mahch g Jiosh. Pi at wo e nako hegam mas am wo i em‑wehmajk.
<sax> I'm pleading with you, my friends: be like me, because I became like you.  You've never treated me badly. ||| Am g hab wo masmak mani ahni nani pi hahawa pi ab hu wecho g heki hu t‑chehanig.
<sax> You remember that it was because I was sick that I shared with you the good news on my first visit. ||| S‑mahch am mo wa haꞌichu pi ni‑apꞌe mant wa am jiwia k am em‑ahgid ab amjed g Jiosh alidag.
<sax> Even though my illness was difficult for you, you didn't despise or reject me—in fact you treated me like an angel of God, like Christ Jesus himself. ||| M wa eda pi shaꞌi s‑ni‑tamhog ch ab i s‑ni‑hoꞌigeꞌid k i ni‑wahkid k am ni‑nuhkud heg wa wepo mantp d hema anghil o d Jiosh alidag.
<sax> So what's happened to all your gratefulness? I tell you, back then if you could have pulled out your eyes and given them to me, you would have! ||| Ab o wa si geꞌej g pihk em‑elidadag mamtsh chum hems g e‑wuhpui wo ni‑mah heg hekaj pi ni‑apꞌedag.
<sax> So what has happened—have I become your enemy by telling you the truth? ||| Kut haschu has e juh mam heg amjed hab ni‑elid manis s‑em‑kehꞌid ahni mani am chum em‑ahgid g wohokam?
<sax> These people are keen to gain your support, but not for any good reasons. On the contrary, they want to keep you away from us so that you will enthusiastically support them. ||| Hegam mo hab chum em‑elid mamt am oidk hab wo e junihid g chehanig ch hekaj am wo i e apꞌech Jiosh tahgio o hab wabsh e wua mo ab em‑tatchua ch wabshaba em‑iattogid no pi gam hu hab i s‑em‑junimk ab ni‑amjed mamt ab wo si ha haꞌichuchudad.
<sax> Of course it's good to want to do good. But this should be at all times, not just when I'm there with you! ||| M o wa s‑apꞌe mat ab hema wo em‑tatchuad haꞌichu s‑apꞌekam wehhejed. Bani wa ni‑tahtk chum anis pi am hu em‑wehmaj. K wabshaba idam em‑tatchua g haꞌichu pi apꞌekam wehhejed.
<sax> Answer me this, you people who want to live under the law: Don't you hear what the law is saying? ||| M haschu ahgch hab chum e elid mamt am wo i e apꞌech Jiosh tahgio am oidch hab e junihidch g chehanig? Pi amt wo shaꞌi e nako mamt am hejel wo i e apꞌech.
<sax> As Scripture says, Abraham had two sons, one from the servant girl, and one from the free woman. ||| Id ant am wo em‑tashogi ab amjed g Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana.
<sax> However the son from the servant girl was born following a human plan, while the son from the free woman was born as the result of the promise. ||| Pi atsh koi bei g e‑mad d Sarabad k eda heki hu okst. Sh wabshaba g Jiosh am ha ahgid mat wo ge madt. Kush ihda madaj d ha‑aliga. Sh wabshaba g Hagarbad mad d ha‑neholiga hab masma mo g jeꞌej.
<sax> This provides an analogy: these two women represent two covenants. One covenant is from Mount Sinai—Hagar—and she gives birth to slave children.  Hagar symbolizes Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the current Jerusalem, because she is in slavery with her children.  But the heavenly Jerusalem is free. She is our mother. ||| Sarabad ani wepogid g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh. Ch ahchim mach ab s‑wohochud wepogidas g Sarabad mad nach pi woho d aꞌaligaj g Jiosh. Hagarbad ani wepogid hegai chehanig mat ab e mah Sinai doꞌag t ab am Arabia jewed ch ed.

Kuch heg wui t‑gewpkadch wehsijj ahchim matt ab i s‑wohoch g Jiosh k am tahgio i t‑apꞌech.
<sax> As Scripture says, “Rejoice you who are childless and who have never given birth! Shout aloud for joy, you who have never been in labor—for the abandoned woman has more children than the woman who has a husband!” ||| An o hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed mash hab kaij g Jiosh:
<sax> Now my friends, we are children of promise just like Isaac. ||| Pegih neh, Isaacbad ash d si ha‑aliga hab masma mash am ha ahgid g Jiosh. Ch ahchim hab wa masma d aꞌaligaj g Jiosh.
<sax> However just as the one born according to a human plan persecuted the one born through the Spirit, so it is today. ||| Heg ash wa shoꞌigchud g Isaacbad mash pi d si ha‑aliga. K hemuch hab waꞌap t‑shoꞌigchud hegam mo pi d aꞌaligaj g Jiosh.
<sax> But what does Scripture say? “Send away the servant girl and her son, for the son of the servant girl will not be an heir together with the son of the free woman.” ||| An o oꞌohadag mash hab kaij g Jiosh ab Abrahambad wui:
<sax> Let me repeat: every man who is circumcised has to keep the whole of the law. ||| Nam woho hab e elid mamt am wo i e apꞌech Jiosh tahgio g pahl hikuchkakaj? Nt wo em‑ahgi mamt hemho wa am wehs oidk hab wo e juh g chehanig mamtp heg hekaj am wo i chum e apꞌech.
<sax> Those of you who think you can be made right by the law are cut off from Christ—you have abandoned grace. ||| Am o s‑em‑apchudamk g Christ. Mt wabshaba gam hu hab wo i juh mamtp hejel chum s‑e apchudamk am oidch hab e wuadch g chehanig.
<sax> For through the Spirit we trust and wait in hope to be made right. ||| Ab o t‑mahkch g gewkdag g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. Kuch hekaj ab wui t‑gewpkadch mat g Jiosh s‑ap am wo i t‑apꞌech e tahgio.
<sax> For in Christ Jesus being circumcised or uncircumcised doesn't achieve anything; it's only trust working through love that matters. ||| Pi o hi wa has chuꞌig matp hema heki hu wo e pahl hikuch o pi wo e pahl hikuch. Do waꞌi ihda mamt ab wo i s‑wohoch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga k wo chehgidch g si pihk e‑elidadag am i ha wehmajch.
<sax> You were doing so well! Who got in the way and prevented you from being convinced by the truth? ||| S‑ap am wa chum s‑wohochud g wohokam. Tsh wabshaba am haꞌi dada em‑wui k im hu hab i chum em‑wanchshulig.
<sax> This “persuasion” certainly isn't from the One who calls you. ||| Pi o d Jiosh mo im hu hab i em‑wanchshulig ab amjed g wohokam.
<sax> You only need a little bit of yeast to raise the whole batch of dough. ||| Bamtp elid mo d wabsh al chum haꞌichu ihda. T eda wehs wo padch g em‑wohochudadag ch em‑doakag hab masma mat g jewajidakud wehs wo jewaj g wahga.
<sax> I'm confident in the Lord that you won't change the way you think, and that the one who is confusing you will face the consequences, whoever he is. ||| Bani em‑elid mam d wabsh kia ni‑wehm wohochuddam ch pi gam hu wo i e nohnogi ab amjed g Jiosh hoꞌigeꞌidadag. T g Jiosh s‑koꞌokam wo ha namkid hegam mo hedai im hu hab i chum em‑wanchshulig.
<sax> You, my brothers and sisters, were called to freedom! Just don't use your freedom as an excuse to indulge your sinful human nature—instead serve one another in love. ||| Pi at hab ahgk ab i em‑wai g Jiosh mat ged hu wabsh wo i si em‑dagsh heg hekaj e‑chehanig k wabshaba hab ahgk mamt d wo aꞌaligajk. Pegih, mt heg hekaj ab wo si pihk e elidad ab aꞌai e wui ch pi wabsh g hejel e‑tatchui hab wo junihid.
<sax> For the whole law is summed up in this one command, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” ||| Bo chuꞌig g Jiosh oꞌohana:
<sax> My advice is to walk by the Spirit. Don't satisfy the desires of your sinful human nature.  For the desires of the sinful nature are opposed to the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are opposed to the sinful nature. They fight one another, so you don't do what you want to do. ||| Pi o wepo chuꞌig g oꞌodham tatchui ch Jiosh tatchui. Kumt ab wo e dagitokchid Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag wui. T heg ab wo em‑shohbidad ch wo i em‑wanimedad. Mt hab pi hab wo junihid g hejel pi ap e‑tatchui.
<sax> But if the Spirit leads you, you're not under the law. ||| Pi at ab hu haꞌichu wo em‑chuꞌijigch g chehanig mamtp woho am wo i e dagitokchid Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag wui.
<sax> It's clear what the sinful human nature produces: sexual immorality, indecency, sensuality, ||| M o tasho g wabsh oꞌodham tatchui. Hegam mo hab wua g hejel e‑tatchui atp hems woꞌiwup hema i wehm mo pi d ha‑wehm kihkam o hab wua g nahnko mahs s‑uam haꞌichu.
<sax> idolatry, sorcery, hatred, rivalry, jealousy, anger, selfish ambition, dissension, heresy, ||| Hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh o gawul haꞌichu chum jioshchud o haꞌi atp hems ha hihoin o atp hems aꞌai e cheggia o aꞌai s‑e hehgamk o babgat o nahnko ha ahg o s‑chu daꞌadag o aꞌai e gaꞌagwulkad.
<sax> envy, drunkenness, feasting, and similar things. As I warned you before so I warn you again: nobody who behaves like this will inherit the kingdom of God. ||| o s‑behimk g haꞌichu ha‑eniga o nawkkoꞌo o s‑tohntom has e wua. Hegam mo hab masma haꞌichu hab wua at pi am hu wo i wahp Jiosh kihdag ed.
<sax> But the Spirit produces fruit such as love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, trust,  gentleness, self-control—and there's no law against these kinds of things! ||| Kuch wabshaba pi hab mahs ahchim mo am t‑eda ulinig g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. Heg o am chikpan g t‑doakag. Kuch hab si pihk t‑elid ha hekaj ch si s‑ap t‑tahtk ch ab wabsh i s‑dodolima ch s‑t‑tahtk ch nenida mo haschu g Jiosh apꞌechudch t‑wehhejed ch s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌid g hemajkam ch s‑apꞌe ch s‑hemajima ch wabsh si t‑shohbidch ch am hab wo juh mach has i kaij. Pi o an hu shaꞌi shohbidch g chehanig hegai hab mahs haꞌichu.
<sax> Let's not become boastful, or irritate and envy one another. ||| Pi att wo ge t‑haschudad ch pi aꞌai wo t‑kudutad ch pi wo chu hehgamk.
<sax> My friends, if someone is led astray by sin, you who are spiritual should bring them back with a gentle spirit. Watch out that you don't get tempted too. ||| Matp hema pi ap haꞌichu hab wo juh g em‑wehm wohochuddam, mt am wo i gewkemhu mat am wo i e apꞌech ahpim mam am e dagitokch Jiosh wui. Kumt wabshaba wo e shoꞌigchud k si s‑hemajim am hab wo juh ihda heg hekaj mamtp hems hema ahpim haha wabsh pi ap haꞌichu hab wo juh.
<sax> Carry each other's burdens, for in this way you fulfill the law of Christ. ||| Nam hig woho am oidch hab s‑e junimk g chehanig? Pegih, k ab t‑chehani g Jiosh alidag matt am aꞌai wo i t‑wehmajk.
<sax> Those who think they're really something—when they're actually nothing—only fool themselves. ||| Pi g am wo chum si e haꞌichuchud. Dach wabsh shoꞌigkam ch wabsh hejel wo t‑iattogi mattp ab wo chum si t‑haꞌichuch.
<sax> Carefully examine your actions. Then you can be satisfied with yourself, without comparing yourself to anyone else.  We have to take responsibility for ourselves. ||| Pi att hab wo chei machs baꞌich i s‑ap hab wua g t‑chikpan mo hema ehp. Do wabsh heheꞌejel t‑chikpan hegai mach hab wua. Kutt heg wo waꞌi aꞌappe hejel t‑chikpan k wo si s‑ap t‑taht mattp s‑ap hab wo wuad.
<sax> Those that are taught the Word should treat their teachers well, sharing with them all good things. ||| K ab em‑ab mamt ab haꞌichu wo ha mah hegam mo am em‑mashcham g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga mamt hekaj am epai wo i ha wehmt.
<sax> Don't be fooled, God can't be treated with contempt: whatever you sow, that's what you reap. ||| Pi amt wo e nako mamt wo iattogi g Jiosh.

Pegih, k hab wa masma am t‑doakag wehhejed.
<sax> If you sow according to your sinful human nature, from that nature you'll reap self-destruction. But if you sow according to the Spirit, from the Spirit you'll reap eternal life. ||| Mt wo s‑koꞌokam e namkid am i muhk mamtp hab wo sha juh g hejel e‑tatchui k wabshaba chum hekid an wehmaj wo kihkad g Jiosh mamtp wo e dagito Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag wui k hab wo junihid g Jiosh tatchui.
<sax> Notice how big the letters are, now that I'm writing with my own hand! ||| Hemu ant hejel haꞌichu am wo i em‑oꞌohani. Mt wo s‑mai mani d ahni an neidk mani haꞌas an i oꞌohan.
<sax> Those people who only want to make a good impression are forcing you to be circumcised just so they won't be persecuted for the cross of Christ.  Even those who are circumcised don't keep the law, but they want to have you circumcised so that they can boast about you and claim you as their followers. ||| Hegam mo ahgahim mamt wo e pahl hikuch k hab wo s‑apꞌekam am Jiosh tahgio o ab chum si e haꞌichuchud mam am oidch hab e junihim g ha‑chehanig. K eda hejel pi am hu ap hab junihim. Ab at muh g Christ kots t ab am t‑wehhejed. K eda hegam pi ahgachug ihda no pi s‑gihug mat g ha wehm Tutuligo wo ha shoꞌigch.
<sax> May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Through this cross, the world has been crucified to me, and I've been crucified as far as the world is concerned. ||| Kuni eda heg waꞌi ahgachug matt ab wo i s‑wohoch mat g Jesus ab muh kots t ab am t‑wehhejed. Do waꞌi ihda mant hekaj ni‑doꞌibia. Kut g jewed t ab haꞌichu wabsh pi e haꞌichuch am ni‑wehhejed.
<sax> Circumcision or uncircumcision doesn't matter—what matters is that we're created brand new! ||| Pi o d shaꞌi haꞌichu g pahl hikuchka. Id o d si haꞌichu mamt ab wo i s‑wohoch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga k hab wo bei g wechij doakag.

<sax> Please, don't anyone trouble me anymore, because I carry on my body the scars of Jesus. ||| Pi ant hahawa haꞌichukaj wo shaꞌi ni‑kudu nani pi ab s‑babaliwuani heg amjed mat g Jiosh alidag obga muꞌikko ni‑gewittan k ni‑maꞌikka. Heg o wa wepo mant ni‑nakpi mani d piongaj g t‑kownalig Jesus.
<sax> My brothers and sisters, may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. ||| Neh, ab at wo wa baꞌich i s‑em‑hoꞌigeꞌidad g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ.
<sax> God, who in the past spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at various times and in many ways, ||| Heki atsh hu am haꞌi i ha chuhcha g Jiosh g t-shohshonbad matsh am wo amogad g haꞌichu ahgaj. Kush idam Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam heꞌes am al i ha tashogid g Jiosh aꞌahidag oidam.
<sax> He was placed much higher than the angels since he received a greater name than them. ||| Neh, bo wa masma am e chehgidch mo id d alidaj g Jiosh. K heg hekaj tasho mo baꞌich d i si s-has haꞌichu mo hi g anghil.
<sax> God never said to any angel, “You are my Son; today I have become your Father,” or “I will be a Father to him, and he will be a Son to me.” ||| Jiosh ash pi hekid hema g anghil hab ahg mo d alidaj ch wabshaba hab kaij id wui:
<sax> What are the angels? They are beings that serve, sent out to help those who will receive salvation. ||| Anghil ash pi wepo masma g Jiosh alidag ch d wabsh gewpkdag mash am chikpan Jiosh wehhejed. Kuch ahchim d hahawa Jiosh aꞌaliga t‑doꞌibiak ch am wo i wahp kihdaj ed. Kush g anghil d Jiosh pionag ch atsh am wo i t‑wehmajk.
<sax> So we should pay even closer attention to what we've learned so we don't drift away from it. ||| Neh, wehs ihda o ab t‑chehgidch mo g Jiosh alidag wehs dahm g e‑nahtoi. Kutt heg hekaj ab wo si t‑uꞌukchid id ab s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj matt kah ch pi gam hu hab wo i t‑juh ab amjed.
<sax> If the message the angels brought was trustworthy, and every sin and disobedient act brings its own consequence, ||| Pi ash d Jiosh alidag ch d wabsh anghil matsh wa ia uꞌapa g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga heki hu. Tsh wabshaba s‑koꞌokam bei g e‑namkidadag hegam mash pi ab hu ha kaiham.
<sax> how will we escape if we don't pay attention to this great salvation that the Lord first announced, and then we had confirmed to us by those who heard him. ||| Sh eda d si alidaj g Jiosh hegai matsh hemu ia uꞌapa g haꞌichu ahgaj. Kutt hemho wa ab wo kaihamad. Am o t‑tashogid g doꞌibiadag. Kutt pi has masma wo t‑doꞌibia ab amjed g s‑koꞌok t‑namkidadag matt pi ab hu wo kaihamad.
<sax> God also testified through signs and miracles, by acts that show his power, and by the gifts of the Holy Spirit, given as he chose. ||| K g Jiosh hab ha junidahim g s‑hasig haꞌichu ch hekaj am wohokamchud g haꞌichu ha ahga. K g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ab t‑mahkch g gewkdag mach hekaj hab wua g nahnko mahs i wehmtadag ch i gewkemhunadag ab aꞌai t‑wui.
<sax> It's not angels who will be in charge of the world to come that we're talking about. ||| Pi ash d anghil mas g Jiosh am i ha chuhcha mat am wo himchudad g kownaltaligaj. Dach ahchim hemajkam.
<sax> For both the one who makes people holy and those who are made holy belong to the same family.  That's why he doesn't hesitate to call them “brothers,” ||| Pegih, tsh hab wa masma ab i t‑gawulkai g Jiosh alidag matt hab waꞌap d wo Jiosh aꞌaligak ch pi wo ha chuꞌijigk. Kush heg hekaj pi shaꞌi e elid mat hab wo t‑aꞌagad ‘ni‑wepnag.’
<sax> saying “I will announce your name to my brothers; I will praise you among your people when they meet together.” ||| An o hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed mash g alidaj s‑t‑nawojimk ch hab ahg g Jiosh:
<sax> Because the children share flesh and blood in common, he shared in this in the same way so that through death he could destroy the one that had the power of death—the devil— ||| Kush eda g Jiawul edgid g gewkdag mat ab wo t‑abch g t‑chuꞌijig matt hekaj gam hu hab wo i t‑juh ab amjed g Jiosh.

<sax> and free everyone who through fear of death were enslaved all their lives. ||| Jiosh alidag atsh gewito g Jiawul am t‑wehhejed. Kutt heg hekaj pi wo ehbidad g muhkig.
<sax> Of course it's not angels he's concerned about; he's concerned to help the children of Abraham. ||| Pi ash d anghil mas g Jiosh wo ha doꞌibia. Dach ahchim hemajkam mach ab s‑wohochud.
<sax> That's why it was necessary for him to become like his brothers in everything, so that he could become a merciful and trustworthy high priest in the things of God, to forgive his people's sins. ||| Tsh heg wa hekaj am t‑wepo e juh k t‑wepo masma ia oimmelhim ch haꞌichu nakog. Bat waꞌi masma s‑ap d wo t‑uhgchu pahligk ch ab wo s‑t‑hoꞌigeꞌidad ch gam hu hab wo i juh g t‑chuꞌijig am wehhejed g Jiosh.
<sax> Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted. ||| Jiawul o chum t‑chehani matt hab wo juh g pi apꞌekam. K wabshaba g Jesus s‑ap e nakog mat am wo i t‑gewkemhunad nash pi hab waꞌap nakog mash wa g Jiawul chum chehani g pi apꞌekam.
<sax> So, my brothers and sisters who live for God and who share in this heavenly calling, we need to think carefully about Jesus—the one we say is sent by God,  and is the High Priest. ||| Pegih, ni‑wehm wohochuddam, ab at i em‑gawulkai g Jiosh gahi wuhshanim g e‑alidag Jesus. Heg o d Jiosh si Kehsha ch d uhgchu t‑pahlig. Kumt wo oidahid mo has chuꞌig.
<sax> As a servant, Moses was faithful in God's house. He provided evidence of what would be announced later. ||| Mosesbad ash s‑ap am hab junihim g e‑chikpan am ha shahgid g Jiosh hemajkamga ch wabshaba d wabsh Jiosh pionag. Tsh g Jiosh am i kei matsh wo haꞌichu aꞌaga wehhejed matsh gam hu baꞌich hahawa s‑ap wo i e tashogit.
<sax> But Christ is a son, in charge of God's house. And we are God's house as long as we hold on with confidence to the hope we boast we believe in. ||| Kush eda g Jesus d Jiosh alidag ch d si kehshaj matsh wehs am wo ha dahmkad g hemajkamgaj. Kuch ahchim d hemajkamgaj mattp pi wo dagito g t‑wohochudadag k wabsh s‑ap t‑tahtkk ch wo nenida mat hab wo t‑juni mo has i kaij.
<sax> This is why the Holy Spirit says, “If you hear what God is saying to you today, ||| Neh, bash masma hab chuꞌig am t‑wehhejed mash wa hab chuꞌig am ha wehhejed g t‑shohshonbad ahchim Tutuligo. Hegam ha wui ash hab kaij g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag:
<sax> Brothers and sisters, make sure that none of you has an evil mindset that's given up trusting in the God of life. ||| Neh, tsh wa woho hab e juh g Jiosh neꞌoki am ha wehhejed. Kumt heg hekaj wo s‑e nenꞌeidad mamt pi hab masma wo pi chechkaidagk. Jiosh o d doakam ch woho gam hu hab wo i em‑juh mamtp pi ab hu wo kaihamad.
<sax> Encourage each other every day while you still have “today,” so that none of you will be deceived by sin and become hard-hearted. ||| Ab o t‑waid g Jiosh hemu ch wabshaba pi chum hekid ab wo t‑waidad. Mt wo e iattogi g pi apꞌekamkaj mamtp pi ab hu wo kaihamad g Jiosh. Ab g aꞌai wo i e gewkemhunad mamt ab wo kaihamad.
<sax> For we are partners with Christ as long as we hold on to our confidence in God from beginning to end. ||| Dach s‑wohom Christ hemajkamga mattp an wo si uꞌukchid g t‑wohochudadag wehs t‑doakag oidam.
<sax> As Scripture says, “If you hear what God is saying to you today, don't harden your hearts like the time you rebelled against him.” ||| Mt heg hekaj wo s‑chegitok ihda mani am em‑ahgid ch pi wo pi chechkaidagk hab masma mash wa hegam mash pi ab hu wohog elid g Jiosh.
<sax> Who was it that rebelled against God, even though they heard what he said? Wasn't it all those who were led out of Egypt by Moses? ||| Jiosh atsh wa am ha doꞌibia ab ha amjed g Egypt t am hemajkam am gahi wuhshanim g Mosesbad. Kush eda hahawa pi chechkaidag.
<sax> Therefore let's take care to make sure that even though God has given us his promise of entering his rest, none of you miss out!  For we've heard the good news just like they did, but it didn't help them because they didn't accept and trust in what they heard. ||| Kutki heg hekaj pi am hu ha apꞌet g Jiosh waida. Kutt ahchim wo s‑t‑gihugad matt pi hab wo masmak mash wa hegam. Jiosh ash am t‑wehhejed apꞌechudch e‑kihdag ed hab sha masma mash wa am ha wehhejed chum apꞌechudch hegai jewed.
<sax> However those of us who trust in God <span class="it">have</span> entered into that rest God mentioned when he said, “In my frustration I vowed, ‘They shall not enter my rest.’ ” (This is so even though God's plans were already complete when he created the world). ||| Id ash am apꞌechudas ged hu i amjed matsh am e nahto g jewed. Sh wabshaba hab masma hab chuꞌig am t‑wehhejed mash wa hab chuꞌig am ha wehhejed. Jiosh ash hab kaij matsh pi hedai am hu wo i wah pi ab hu wohochudch k wabshaba ab wo bei g s‑koꞌok e‑namkidadag.

<sax> God's rest is still there for some to enter, even though those who previously heard the good news failed to enter because of disobedience. ||| Hegam mat ab wo s‑wohoch g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh atsh am wo i wahp Jiosh kihdag ed.
<sax> So God again sets a day—today—saying a long time later through David as he did before, “If you hear what God is saying to you today, don't harden your hearts.”  For if Joshua had been able to give them rest, God wouldn't have spoken later about another day. ||| Tsh wabshaba g ha‑aꞌaliga am i wahp. Tsh g Joshuabad am i ha wanim. Kush ab ha wui hab hahawa kaij g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ihda mani wa am em‑ahgid:
<sax> For God's word is alive and effective, sharper than any twin-edged sword, so penetrating it separates life and breath, bone joints and their marrow, judging the thoughts and intentions of the mind. ||| Shoꞌo waꞌi si s‑gewkdag g Jiosh neꞌoki.

<sax> Since we have such a great high priest who has ascended to heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us make sure we hold on to what we say we believe. ||| Do si uhgchu t‑pahlig ch d Jiosh alidag g Jesus ch an i wah Jiosh kihdag ed am t‑wehhejed. Kutt heg hekaj ab wo s‑wohochudad chum hekid.
<sax> For the high priest we have isn't one who doesn't sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who was tempted in all the ways we are, but did not sin. ||| Ihda uhgchu t‑pahlig o si pihk e elid t‑hekaj natsh pi ab nakog k s‑mahch hegai mach ahchim ab nakog.

<sax> No one can take the position of high priest for himself; he must be chosen by God, just like Aaron was. ||| Pi atsh hedai am wabsh wo hejel i e kei mat d wo uhgchu pahlk. Jiosh atsh am wo i kei hab masma matsh wa hab juh g Aaronbad ged hu i heki hu matsh g amjedkamaj d wo papalk.
<sax> In just the same way Christ did not honor himself by becoming high priest. It was God who said to him, “You are my Son. Today I have become your Father.” ||| Tsh hab wa masma pi am hu wabsh hejel i e kei g Christ. Jiosh atsh wa am i kehsh k ab wui hab kaij:
<sax> Jesus, while he was here in human form, prayed and appealed with loud cries and tears to God, the one who was able to save him from death. Jesus was heard because of his respect for God. ||| Kush g Jesus ab wui e hoꞌigeꞌidahun ch shoak ch iawua g e‑ohꞌog mash eda ia oimmed ch ab aihim g muhkig. Kush g Jiosh ab kaiham nash pi heg si s‑hemajima ch ab si has elid.
<sax> Even though he was God's Son, Jesus learned practically the meaning of obedience through suffering. ||| Dash Jiosh hab elida matsh wo e shoꞌigchud k wo e muhkid am t‑wehhejed. Kutsh wa woho hab e juh k hab masma s‑mai g wohog elidadag, chum as d Jiosh alidag.
<sax> When his experience was complete, he became the source of eternal salvation to everyone who does what he says, ||| Bat wa masma am i apꞌech g Jiosh mat hab wo juh g pi ha huhugedam doꞌibiadag wehsijj t‑wehhejed mattp hedai ab wo s‑wohog el.
<sax> having been designated by God as a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek. ||| Kush hab kaij g Jiosh mat am i kei mat d wo uhgchu pahlk hab masma mat am i kei g Melkisedek.
<sax> We have much to say about Jesus, and it's hard to explain because you don't seem able to understand! ||| Muꞌi ani haꞌichu chum s‑em‑mashchamimk ab amjed g Christ id hekaj Melkisedek. Mt wabshaba pi wo amich.
<sax> By now you should have had enough time to become teachers, but you need someone to teach you the fundamentals, the first principles of God's word. It's like you need to go back to baby milk instead of solid food! ||| Idani amki tash d Jiosh wohochuddam ch hab wo chum chuꞌigk mamt haꞌi ep wo ha mashcha. Kumtki eda koi si s‑ap s‑mai g wehpeg mashchama. Bam sha masma mam d wabsh kia al hahaꞌas aꞌal ch hegai waꞌi wihbi ihꞌe
<sax> So let's not get stuck on the basic teachings about Christ, but let's progress to a more mature understanding. We don't need to go over again the ideas of repenting from what we used to do, about trusting in God— ||| Gd hu i si wehpeg att am em‑mashcha mamt gam hu wo s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegitoi k ab wo i s‑wohoch g Jiosh
<sax> or teachings about baptism, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment. ||| k wo e pahl wapko. T g Jiosh ab wo i em‑wuwhas muhkig t amjed k pi wo em‑lodai. Kutt heki hu em‑mashcha mamt ab wo ha taht hegam mat hab waꞌap ab wo i s‑wohoch g Jiosh k wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahu am ha wehhejed. Kut ab wo bei g gewkdaj g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag hab masma mamt ahpim.
<sax> So let's get on with it, as God gives us the opportunity! ||| Id o d hema hegam wehpeg mashchama am t‑wohochudadag ed. K wabshaba haꞌichu d ep hegai mamt ep wo s‑mai. Mt heg hekaj pi heg wo waꞌi aꞌagad mo d si shondaj g t‑wohochudadag.
<sax> It's impossible for those who once understood and experienced God's heavenly gift—who shared in receiving the Holy Spirit, ||| Pi at wo e nako hegam mat wo s‑mahchk g Jiosh ch wo dagito mas gam hu ep wo s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegito k ep wo bei g wechij doakag. Heki o hu ha tonlid g Jiosh g ha‑amichudadag. K g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag am ha eda chikpan. Kut chum bei ihda wechij doakag
<sax> who had known God's good word and the power of the coming age— ||| k chum s‑mahch mo g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga s‑apꞌe ch neid g Jiosh gewkdag
<sax> and then completely abandon God, for them to be brought back to repentance once more. They themselves have crucified the Son of God all over again and publicly humiliated him. ||| ch wabshaba wehs dagito ihda heg hekaj pi apꞌekam. Heg o wa wepo mat ab ep sisish g Jiosh alidag kots t ab k si edawua am ep i e nohnogidk pi apꞌekam wui. Kut pi wo shaꞌi e nako mas gam hu ep wo s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegitoi.
<sax> Land that has been watered by rain, and produces crops for those who farm it, has God's blessing.  But land that only produces weeds and thorns is worthless, and is about to be condemned. In the end all that can be done is to burn it. ||| Neh, no hig pi woho mam hab elid g e‑eꞌes mat chum s‑kehg wo bahidagt mat hekid wo juh. Kumt wo dagito hegai oidag mat wabsh g hoꞌi wo i wuhshad. Pegih, t hab wa masma wo em‑dagito g Jiosh mamtp pi haꞌichu wehhejed wo s‑kehgajk.
<sax> But dear friends, we believe better of you and your salvation, even if we talk like this! ||| Ni wabshaba hab em‑elid mamt woho e doꞌibia k hab masma ab baꞌich wo i bei g Jiosh hoꞌigeꞌidadag.
<sax> Don't be spiritually lazy, but follow the example of those who through trusting in God and patience inherit what God has promised. ||| Hegam mash wa heki hu ab s‑wohochud g Jiosh ash s‑bahbagi ab nenida mat hab wo ha juni mash haschu hab kaij mat hab wo juh. Kumt ahpim hab wo wa masmak.
<sax> When God gave his promise to Abraham he could swear by no one greater so he took an oath on himself, ||| Jiosh ash wa am si ahg g t‑shohshonbad Abraham mash haschu ab t‑makiog
<sax> saying, “I will definitely bless you, and multiply your descendants.” ||| ab wui hab kaijch:
<sax> People swear on things that are greater than they are, and when they have some dispute the oath is taken as the final word on the matter. ||| Neh, s‑mahch ach mat am Jiosh tahgio aꞌai wo i apꞌech g hemajkam mat woho hab wo juh g haꞌichu e‑ahga.
<sax> That's why God wanted to demonstrate more clearly to those who would inherit the promise that he would never ever change his mind. ||| Pegih, t g Jiosh am hejel e tahgio i apꞌech g haꞌichu e‑ahga Abrahambad wui no pi pi hedai baꞌich i geꞌej mas am tahgio wo i apꞌech. Bo masma am t‑chehgidch ahchim mach ab s‑wohochud mat pi hekid am gawul wo juh g hab e‑elida.
<sax> So by these two actions that can't be changed, and since it's impossible for God to lie, we can have total confidence, having run for safety to take hold of the hope God presented to us. ||| Kutt heg hekaj ab wo t‑gewkemhunad mat s‑ap wo nahto g t‑doꞌibiadag.
<sax> This hope is our spiritual anchor—it's both certain and reliable, and it takes us past the curtain to the presence of God.  That's where Jesus went in on our behalf, because he had become a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek. ||| Jesus atsh am heki hu i wah dahm kahchim ch ed. Kuch heg hekaj s‑mahch mat am wo i t‑wahpki ahchim mach ab s‑wohochud. Jiosh atsh am i kei matsh d wo uhgchu t‑pahligk chum hekid. Pi ash heg hekaj d pahl mas d papal ha amjedkam. Jiosh atsh am i kei hab masma matsh wa heki hu am i kei hegai mash hab chehgig Melkisedek.
<sax> Melchizedek was king of Salem and priest of the Most High God. He met Abraham who was returning from defeating the kings and blessed him. ||| Nt wo haꞌichu em‑ahgi ab amjed hegai Melkisedekbad mant wo em‑tashogi g Jesus chikpan. Jiosh atsh am i kei g Melkisedekbad. Kush d kownal am Salem kihhim ch ed ch d ep pahl.
<sax> Think how great this man was for Abraham the patriarch to give him a tithe of what was won in battle. ||| Melkisedekbad oki baꞌich d i si s‑has haꞌichu mo g Abrahambad. Tsh heg ab mah g hemako tahpna mo wehst‑mahm e tahpanch g gehgewadaj matsh am ui cheggiadag ed
<sax> Yes, the sons of Levi who are priests were commanded by the law to receive a tithe from the people, their brothers and sisters, who are descended from Abraham. ||| K hab chuꞌig g t‑chehanig matsh hegam t‑wehm oꞌodham mo d Levibad amjedkam ch d papal ab t‑amjed wo ui hegai hemako tahpna matsh wehst‑mahm wo e tahpanch g t‑gehgewadag.
<sax> But Melchizedek who doesn't share their ancestry received tithes from Abraham, and blessed the one who had God's promises. ||| Kush ihda Melkisedekbad pi d Levibad amjedkam. Tsh eda g Abrahambad ab namkid hegai mo d Jiosh wuikam. Tsh g Melkisedekbad ab i s‑hoꞌigeꞌel.
<sax> There's no argument that the lesser person is blessed by the one who is greater. ||| Kuch s‑mahch mat g geꞌechu ab wo s‑hoꞌigeꞌel g chumchu. K heg hekaj baꞌich i geꞌej g Melkisedekbad mo g Abrahambad.
<sax> In the one case tithes are received by men who die, but in the other by one who is said to be living. ||| Melkisedekbad o baꞌich d i si s‑has haꞌichu mo g t‑papalig. Hegam o wabsh koꞌihim. K wabshaba pi an hu hebai oꞌohanas mat muh g Melkisedekbad.
<sax> So you could say that Levi, the one who receives tithes, has paid tithes through being a descendant of Abraham, ||| K heg wa wepo mat g t‑papalig ha‑shohshonbad Levi am namkid g Melkisedekbad
<sax> for he was yet to be born from his father when Melchizedek met Abraham. ||| nash pi ab d Abrahambad amjedkam mash heg am namkid.
<sax> Now if perfection could have been achieved through the priesthood of Levi (for that's how the law was received), what was the need for another priest to come following the order of Melchizedek, and not following the order of Aaron? ||| Jiosh atsh am i ha chuhcha g Levibad amjedkam matsh d wo t‑papaligk ch ab wo t‑mah g chehanigaj. T wabshaba pi wo shaꞌi e nako g t‑papalig mas am wo i t‑apꞌech g Jiosh wehhejed. Tsh heg hekaj ab hema ep i wuhsh mash gawul masma mo hegam ch wepo masma g Melkisedekbad.
<sax> What makes it even clearer is when another priest appears who is similar to Melchizedek, ||| Neh, baꞌich ant am wo i em‑tashogi mo g Jesus pi ha wepo masma g t‑papalig ch wabshaba wepo masma g Melkisedekbad.
<sax> and who didn't become a priest by virtue of his human ancestry but by the power of a life that cannot be ended. ||| Pi atsh e pahlch g t‑chehanigkaj k wabshaba e pahlch g gewkdajkaj g e‑doakag. K g doakaj d pi ha huhugedam.
<sax> That's why it says, “You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.” ||| Heg o hekaj ab amjed oꞌohanas mash ab wui hab kaij g Jiosh:
<sax> So the previous rule has been set aside because it was powerless and didn't work,  (for the law didn't make anything perfect). But now it's been replaced by a better hope by which we can come close to God. ||| Kut heg am i t‑apꞌech Jiosh tahgio mach ab hahawa s‑ap miabid. Heki hu t‑chehanig o pi ab hu shaꞌi t‑mahkch g gewkdag machs hekaj am wo i t‑apꞌech Jiosh wehhejed. Kut hekaj g Jiosh gam hu hab i juh.
<sax> This  was not without an oath, even though those who become priests do so without an oath. ||| Jiosh ash hab wabsh kaij matsh g Levibad amjedkam d wo papalk
<sax> But he became a priest with an oath because God told him, “The Lord has taken a solemn vow and will not change his mind: You are a priest forever.” ||| ch wabshaba g e‑gewkdagkaj hab kaij ab wui g Jesus:
<sax> There have been many priests because death prevented them from being able to continue; ||| Hegam Levibad amjedkam at pi wo e nako mas d wo papalk chum hekid no pi koꞌihim.
<sax> but since Jesus lives forever, his priesthood is permanent. ||| T wabshaba g Jesus chum hekid d wo doakamk. T hab pi hedai ep am kehkud ed wo i kekiwua.
<sax> Unlike those human high priests, he doesn't need to offer a daily sacrifice for his sins and then the sins of the people. He did this once, and for everyone, when he offered himself. ||| Pi o wepo masma hegam mo d uꞌugchu papal am heki hu t‑chehanig ed. (a) Hegam o d pi ap chuꞌijkam ch wehpeg ab wo haꞌichu iagchul hejel e‑chuꞌijig wehhejed k ab haha wo iagchul g hemajkam ha‑chuꞌijig wehhejed. K wabshaba g Jesus pi ha chuꞌijig. (b) Hegam o chum hekid ab haꞌichu iagchulid Jiosh wui. T wabshaba g Jesus hemho hab juh. T heg wehs am i apꞌech g pi ap ha‑chuꞌijig. (c) Hegam o ab haꞌichu chum namkid g Jiosh. T wabshaba g Jesus hejel am i e dagito mat hekaj ab wo iagchul.
<sax> The law appoints imperfect men as high priests, but God gave his solemn vow after the law, and appointed his Son, perfect forever. ||| Hegam mo d papal ab heki hu t‑chehanig wecho o pi d shaꞌi hekiakam ch pi ap wo nahto g e‑chikpan. T wabshaba g Jiosh am hahawa i kei g e‑alidag g hejel e‑gewkdagkaj. K heg d uhgchu t‑pahlig ch d si hekiakam. Pi at hekid wo huhug g gewkdaj. T hab s‑ap wo nahto g e‑chikpan.
<sax> The main point of what we're saying is this: We have just such a high priest who is seated at the right hand of God, who sits in majesty on his throne in heaven. ||| Neh, bo wa masma d uhgchu pahl g Jesus mant am i em‑tashogi. Kush g Jiosh ab si has elid ch am e wehm dahshch e‑kownal daikud ed.
<sax> He serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle that was set up by the Lord and not by human beings. ||| Jiosh kihdag o si s‑wohom d geꞌe cheopi ch pi d wabsh hemajkam ha‑nahtoi. K heg eda am chikpan ihda si s‑wohom uhgchu t‑pahlig.
<sax> Since it's the responsibility of every high priest to offer gifts and sacrifices, this high priest must also have something to offer. ||| Uꞌugchu papal at ab haꞌichu wo chum iagchul Jiosh wui am wehhejed g pi ap ha‑chuꞌijig g hemajkam. T id hab waꞌap wo wa juh g Jesus.
<sax> Now if he was here on earth, he wouldn't be a priest at all, because there are already priests to present the offerings that the law requires. ||| K eda pi hiwgidas mas hab wo juh ia jewed dahm no ge d Levibad amjedkam. Do waꞌi idam mo am t‑himdag chehanig ed hab wua g chuꞌijig iagchulida.
<sax> The place they serve is a copy, a mere shadow of what is in heaven. That's what God told Moses when he was going to set up the tabernacle: “Be careful to make everything according to the blueprint you were shown on the mountain.” ||| K eda g ha‑chikpan wabsh t‑chehgidch g Jiosh kihdag ch hegai si s‑wohom chuꞌijig iagchulida.
<sax> But Jesus has been given a far better ministry just as he is the one who mediates a far better agreed relationship between us and God, which is based on much better promises. ||| Neh, hegam uꞌugchu papal o am i chum ha wehmt g hemajkam heg hekaj heki hu hab elidaj g Jiosh. K wabshaba ihda wechij haꞌichu hab elidaj baꞌich i s‑kehgaj no pi g Jiosh baꞌich i s‑kehg haꞌichu ab t‑makiog. K g Jesus baꞌich i s‑ap i t‑wehmt heg hekaj.
<sax> The former system had instructions as to how to worship, and an earthly sanctuary. ||| Am o apchudas heg eda heki hu chehanig mat has masma g hemajkam ab has wo elidad g Jiosh ch am ep apchudas mat g hemajkam am wo i kei g ikus kih mat hab d wo ahgak.
<sax> The first room in the tabernacle housed the candlestick, the table, and the sacred bread. This was called the Holy Place. ||| Id ash wa an e eda kuhpi. K hegai wehpeg kih hab e aꞌaga ‘Hekia S‑apꞌekam Kih.’ Sh id eda am haꞌichug g lalampa chuhchakud ch mihsa. Sh heg ab mihsa g papal am doꞌaw g pahn ch hekaj ab si has elid g Jiosh.
<sax> Past the second veil in the tabernacle was the room called the Most Holy Place. ||| Kush hegai hema ep kih hab e aꞌaga ‘Si Hekia S‑apꞌekam Kih.’
<sax> This contained the golden altar of incense, the gold-covered “agreement chest.”  Inside this were the golden pot containing manna, Aaron's rod that had produced buds, and the stone inscriptions of the agreement. ||| Id ash eda am haꞌichug g ohla iagchulidakud. Kush id ab g papal an memheid g s‑ap uhw haꞌichu. Kush am ep haꞌichug hegai uhs washa mash d chehgida mach d chum Jiosh hemajkamga ahchim Tutuligo. Id ash wehsko e maꞌishch g ohlakaj. Am ash id eda e dahshch g ohla haꞌa. Sh id eda haꞌi nuhkud hegai haꞌichu hugi mash hab e aꞌaga ‘manna.’ Kush am e chekch hegai Aaronbad usaga mash wa ab i iꞌiwgi. Kush wa am ep e toꞌakch hegai gohk koꞌokmalk hohodai mo an ab oꞌohanas g Jiosh chehanig.
<sax> Above this were the glorious angel cherubim covering the place of reconciliation. We can't discuss all of this in detail now. ||| An dahm ihda uhs washa ash an nahtois g gohk anghil ch ab e wui gegok ch g e‑aꞌankaj am ehkchulidch matsh hebai wo e iawua g ehꞌedaj g ha‑iagchulida. Id ash am e iawua matsh hekaj g Jiosh wo s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌid k gam hu hab wo i juh g ha‑chuꞌijig. Pi ant am hu wo kia wehs haꞌichu t tashogi ab amjed ihda.
<sax> Once all of this had been set up, the priests would go in regularly to the first room of the tabernacle to perform their duties. ||| Neh, bash wa masma wehs apchudas idam haꞌichu. Sh g papal am i wahpk wehpeg kih ch ed wehs tashkaj ch am hab wua g e‑chikpan.
<sax> But only the high priest went into the second room, and only once a year. Even then he had to make a sacrifice involving blood, which he offered for himself and for the people's sins of ignorance. ||| Kush wabshaba heg waꞌi si uhgchu pahl ged hu i wapke heg eda baꞌich kih hemho ahid ab. Kush g haꞌichu doakam ehꞌed am iagchulid Jiosh wui am wehhejed g e‑chuꞌijig ch ha‑chuꞌijig g hemajkam matp hems am hab juh pi mahchch mo d pi ap chuꞌijig.
<sax> By this the Holy Spirit indicated that the way into the true Most Holy Place hadn't been revealed while the first tabernacle still existed. ||| Hegai Si Hekia S‑apꞌekam Kih o wepogidas g Jiosh kihdag. K g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag am t‑chehgidch mo pi koi ab hu kuhpiꞌoks g Jiosh kihdag am t‑wehhejed mo eda wabsh kia an kuhpi hegai kih.
<sax> Christ has come as a high priest of all the good experiences we now have. He went into the greater, more complete tabernacle that wasn't made by human hands—not part of this created world. ||| Tsh wa id am woho hab e juh g Christ k d si uhgchu pahl am dahm hegai s‑kehg haꞌichu mash g Jiosh hab kaij matsh hab wo t‑juni. Hegai apchuda mo am eda chikpan g Christ o baꞌich i geꞌej ch baꞌich i s‑apꞌe mo hegai geꞌe cheopi mani am heki hu ahg. Pi at g oꞌodham am nahto. K pi d ihda jewed dahm haꞌichu.
<sax> He didn't enter through the blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood. He entered once, for all time, into the Most Holy Place, setting us free forever. ||| Hemho at am i wah g Christ heg eda apchuda s‑ap nahtok g t‑doꞌibiadag. Hegam mo d jewed dahm papal o wabsh g haꞌichu doakam ha‑ehꞌed am iagchulid. T wabshaba g Jiosh alidag g hejel e‑ehꞌedkaj ab t‑behi g pi ha huhugedam doakag.
<sax> For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a cow sprinkled on those who are ritually unclean make the body ceremonially clean, ||| Neh, mash wa g ha‑ehꞌed g siswat ch totolo ab e sihbanid ch g matai ab amjed g wisilo mehidag ab e nehnichud ha dahm g hemajkam mat wo ha chehgi mat wo i ha kegch g Jiosh heg amjed matp hems pi ap am hu hab junihim g e‑himdag chehanig.
<sax> how much more does the blood of Christ—who offered himself in his sinless life to God through the eternal Spirit—clean your consciences from your past sinful lives so you can serve the living God? ||| Pegih, t baꞌich i geꞌe haꞌichu hab t‑juni g Christ mat am i e dagito Jiosh wui k am t‑wehhejed e muhkid. Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag o wa ab mahkch g gewkdag mat hab juh. K d hekia s‑apꞌekam iagchulida. Heki achd hu t‑kudut heg hekaj pi ap t‑chuꞌijig. T wabshaba g Christ am iagchul g e‑ehꞌed Jiosh wui mat am wo i t‑apꞌech. Kuch am hahawa g Jiosh wehhejed chikpan.
<sax> This is why he is the mediator of a new agreed relationship. Since a death has occurred to set them free from the sins committed under the first agreed relationship, now those who are called can receive the promise of an eternal inheritance. ||| Bash kaij g Jiosh matsh ab wo t‑mah g pi ha huhugedam doakag k ab wo i t‑wahpki e‑kihdag ed. T g alidaj am i apꞌech ihda wechij haꞌichu ahgaj t‑wehhejed ahchim mo g Jiosh ab t‑waid. Muhkigaj at am i t‑wuwhas matt pi wo ai g t‑namkidadag heg hekaj pi ap t‑chuꞌijig ab wecho hegai heki hu apchuda.
<sax> For a will to be implemented, the person who made it must be dead. ||| Neh, mat hema wo muh k am wo dagito g e‑ahga mat hedai wo i ui g haꞌichu enigaj. T hemho wa am wo e wohokamch mat muh ihda oꞌodham. Kut am hahawa hab wo e juh g ahgaj.
<sax> A will is only valid when there's been a death—and is never applied while the person who made it is still alive. ||| Pi at hab wo shaꞌi e juh g ahgaj mat wo kia doakad. T hekid wo i muh, t hab haha wo e juh.
<sax> That's why the first agreement was established with blood. ||| Chum hems hegai heki hu apchuda am ha shahgid g Jiosh ch hemajkam at i e apꞌech g ehꞌedkaj.
<sax> So if the copies of what is in heaven needed to be cleansed in this way, the things in heaven needed cleansing by better sacrifices. ||| Neh, bo masma i e kegchud idam mo am wabsh oidch hab chuꞌig hegai mash am Jiosh kihdag ed. T wabshaba g dahm kahchim apchuda hemho wa baꞌich i s‑apꞌekam iagchulidakaj wo i e kegch.
<sax> For Christ hasn't entered a Most Holy Place constructed by human beings that is only a pattern of the original. He has entered heaven itself, and now appears on our behalf, speaking for us in God's presence. ||| Hegai Si Hekia S‑apꞌekam Kih ash am oidch hab junis g Jiosh kihdag. Tsh g Jiosh alidag pi am wabsh i wah heg eda k wabshaba am i wah Jiosh kihdag ed k idani am t‑wehhejed neok am tahgio g Jiosh.
<sax> This was not to repeatedly offer himself, like a high priest has to enter the Most Holy Place year after year, offering blood that is not his own. ||| Uhgchu t‑pahlig ahchim Tutuligo o wabsh g haꞌichu doakam t‑mumꞌajid ch ab Jiosh wui iagchulid. Tsh wabshaba g Jiosh alidag baꞌich i s‑ap iagchulida hab juh nat pi hejel e muhkid am t‑wehhejed.
<sax> Otherwise Christ would have had to suffer many times since the creation of the world. No: just this one time at the end of the present age he came to remove sin by sacrificing himself. ||| Tsh wabshaba g Jiosh alidag wabsh hemho hab juh k pi muꞌikko e muhkid am t‑wehhejed. Neh, k hab masma tasho mat s‑ap nahto g e‑chikpan mat gam hu hab i juh g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig. Kush hemu hahawa e aihim mat g jewed wo huhug.
<sax> Just as human beings die only once, and then are judged, ||| Am o apchudas mat hemho wa wo muh g oꞌodham hemho k heg i dahm ab wo ai g geꞌe lodaita tash.
<sax> so too for Christ—having been sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people, he will come again, not to deal with sin, but to save those who wait for him. ||| Bat wa masma g Christ hab waꞌap hemho am i e dagito t‑wehhejed k gam hu hab i juh g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig. T id pi am hahawa ep d wo chikpanajk. Tsh wabshaba ia ep wo i e maskogi mat wo t‑doꞌibia ahchim mach ab si hiwig ch ab nenida mat ab ep wo jiwia.
<sax> The law is just a shadow of the good that was to come, and not the actual reality. So it can never through the repeated sacrifices offered year after year make right those who come to worship God. ||| Ab ash wa t‑chehani g Jiosh matt ab wui wo ha iagchulidad g haꞌichu doakam wehs aꞌahid ab. Id atki pi gam hu hab wo i juh g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig k wabshaba wabsh s‑kohmagim t‑chehgidch mat has masma g Jiosh gam hu hab haha wo i juh.
<sax> Otherwise wouldn't the sacrifices have stopped being offered? If the worshipers had been made clean once and for all, they wouldn't have had guilty consciences any longer. ||| Pi at ep wo t‑kudutad g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig matp gam hu s‑ap hab wo i e juh heg hekaj iagchulida. Kutt heki hu waꞌi haꞌasa hab wo juh.
<sax> That's why when Christ  came into the world he said, “You didn't want sacrifices or offerings, but you did prepare a body for me.  Burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin gave you no pleasure. ||| Sh heg hekaj ab wui hab kaij g Jiosh g alidaj am wo jiwiak jewed dahm:
<sax> Every priest officiates in the services day after day, again and again offering the same sacrifices that can never remove sins. ||| Wehs tashkaj o am hab wua g e‑chikpan g t‑papalig ch muꞌikko hab wua g iagchulida. T wabshaba ihda iagchulida pi hekid gam hu hab wo i juh g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig.
<sax> But this Priest, after he had offered for sins a single sacrifice that lasts forever, sat down at God's right hand. ||| Jiosh alidag at hi hemako iagchulida hab juh mat gam hu hab wo i juh. K id chum hekid s‑kehgaj heg wehhejed. T g Jiosh ab hahawa si has elid k an e wehm dahshch e‑kownal daikud ed.
<sax> Now he waits until all his enemies are conquered, becoming like a footstool for him. ||| K idani ab dak ch ab wo ai mat g Jiosh wo ha gewitojel hegam mo ab wui gegok.
<sax> For by a single sacrifice he has set right forever those who are being made holy. ||| Pegih, t hemho am e iagchul t‑wehhejed k hekaj i ha apꞌech iaꞌi amjed wehs hegam mat gam hu oa g pi apꞌekam ha‑ihbdag ed.
<sax> As the Holy Spirit also tells us, for having said, ||| Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag o am hab waꞌap wohokamchud ihda hab masma:
<sax> Now we have the confidence, brothers and sisters, to enter the Most Holy Place by the blood of Jesus. ||| Ab ach hahawa si apꞌedag matt ab wo i miabi g Jiosh nat pi muh g Jesus am t‑wehhejed. Id o heg wa wepo mach apꞌedag matt am wo i wahp heg eda Si Hekia S‑apꞌekam Kih.
<sax> Through his life and death,  he opened up a brand-new, living way through the veil to God. ||| E at muhkid g Christ am t‑wehhejed k hab masma ab i kuhpiꞌo ihda wechij himdag am t‑wehhejed
<sax> So let us hold onto the hope we're telling others about, never hesitating, for God who promised is trustworthy. ||| Jiosh at woho ab wo t‑juni mash has i kaij. Kutt heg hekaj si s‑wihnam wo t‑uꞌukch heg ab.
<sax> Let's think about how we can motivate one another to love and to do what is good. ||| Ab att hig aꞌai wo si pihk t‑elidad ch ab aꞌai wo i t‑wehmtad matt am wo chehgidad mach ab ha tatchua g hemajkam ch am wo i ha wehmajk.
<sax> We should not give up meeting together, as some have done. In fact we should be encouraging one another, especially as you see the End approaching. ||| Haꞌi at haꞌasa ha wehm e nam g e‑wehm wohochuddam.

<sax> For if we deliberately go on sinning after we've understood the truth, there's no longer any sacrifice for sins. ||| Pi at gam hu hab wo shaꞌi e juh g chuꞌijigaj hegai mat am hab wo kia junihid g pi apꞌekam ha chum s‑mahchch g wohokam.

<sax> All that's left is fear, expecting the impending judgment and the terrible fire that destroys those who are hostile to God. ||| Jiosh atsh wo ha lodait k gam hu wo ha shul s‑koꞌok ha‑namkidadag ed. K id hab masma mo g pi ha huhugedam mei. Heg o am waꞌi wiꞌis mat wo chum si s‑ehbidad matsh has wo ha juh.
<sax> Someone who rejects the law of Moses is put to death without mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses. ||| Mosesbad atki an oꞌohana Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana ed matsh gohk o waik wo wohokamch g chuꞌijigaj hegai mat gam hu wo s‑ohhod g Jiosh chehanig. Kutsh wo e muhkid.
<sax> How much worse do you think someone will deserve their punishment if they have trampled underfoot the Son of God, if they have disregarded the blood that sealed the agreement and makes us holy, treating it as ordinary and trivial, and have abused the Spirit of grace? ||| Kumt baꞌich i s‑koꞌok namkidadag ab wo bei mamtp pi ab hu wo haꞌichuch g Jiosh alidag.

<sax> We know God, and he said, “I will make sure that justice is done; I will give people what they deserve.” He also said, “The Lord will judge his people.” ||| nash pi hab kaij g Jiosh:
<sax> You showed your sympathy for those in prison, and took it cheerfully when your possessions were confiscated, knowing that you have something better coming that will truly last. ||| Ab am ha wehm nakog g shoꞌigdag hegam mat e kuhpach.

<sax> So don't lose your confidence in God—it will be richly rewarded. ||| Pi g am wo heb hu wua g e‑wohochudadag. Id at wo em‑uꞌapajel g geꞌe em‑mahkigdag.

<sax> “In just a little while he will come, as he said—he won't delay. ||| Neh, bo chuꞌig an Jiosh oꞌohana ed mo hab kaij g Jiosh:

<sax> Through our trust in God we understand that the whole universe was created by God's command, that what can be seen was made out of what cannot be seen. ||| Ab ach s‑wohochud g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch hekaj s‑amichud mat wehs haꞌichu nahto pi haꞌichu amjed am wabsh neokk.
<sax> By trusting him Abel offered God a better sacrifice than Cain, and as a result God identified him as someone who lived right. God showed this by accepting his offering. Even though Abel has been dead for a long time, he still speaks to us through what he did. ||| Hema ash wa hab chehgig Abel ch ash ab s‑wohochud g Jiosh ch hekaj ab s‑wohog elid k ab wui iagchul g haꞌichu doakam e‑muꞌa.

<sax> Noah trusted God, and was warned by him about things that had never happened before. Because Noah paid serious attention to what God said, he constructed an ark to save his family. By trusting God, Noah showed that the world was wrong, and received the reward of being set right by God. ||| Noahbad atsh ab i s‑wohoch g Jiosh k ab si has elid.

<sax> Through trusting God Abraham obeyed when God called him to go to the land God was going to give him. He left, not knowing where he was going. ||| Abrahambad ash ab s‑wohochud g Jiosh ch ab s‑wohog el. Jiosh ash hab ahg matsh am hu hebai wo mah g mehk jewed. Kutsh ab wui wo hih. Tsh g Abrahambad woho dagito g e‑kihdag k gam hu hih wa chum pi mahchch mas hebai wo hih.
<sax> Trusting in God he lived in the promised land—but as a foreigner, living in tents, together with Isaac and Jacob who shared with him in inheriting the same promise. ||| Jiosh atsh pi oi ha mah hegai jewed.

<sax> For Abraham was looking forward to a city built on foundations that last, with God as its builder and maker. ||| Abrahambad ash ab wui e gewkad hegai kihhim mo d Jiosh nahtoi ch pi hekid wo i gei.
<sax> By her trust in God even Sarah herself was given the ability to conceive a child though she was too old, because she trusted God who had made the promise. ||| Abrahambad ch Sarabad ash wa ab s‑wohochud g Jiosh mash wa hab ha ahgid matsh wo hema mahsid g ali matsh eda heki hu kekelit.

<sax> That is why the descendants of Abraham, (who was as good as dead!), became as numerous as the stars of heaven, as countless as the sand of the sea-shore. ||| Neh, sh wa g Abrahambad d si keli mat pi ep wo chum e nako mas wo alidt. T eda ab amjed i hih muꞌi hemajkam mo pi ta kuintama hab masma mo g huhuꞌu ch hab masma mo g oꞌod an ge kahchki babsho.
<sax> They all died still trusting in God. Though they didn't receive the things God promised, they were still looking for them as it were from a distance and welcomed them, acknowledging that on this earth they were foreigners, people just passing through. ||| Wehsijj idam mach am ha chehcheg at koꞌo k huhug koi wehs uꞌuk hegai mash haschu g Jiosh ab ha makiog.

<sax> People who say such things make it clear that they're looking for a country of their own. ||| Hegam mo hedai s‑mahch ihda o am tasho e gahgid g jewed mat d wo si ha‑enigak.
<sax> Abraham trusted God when he was tested and offered Isaac to God. Abraham, who had accepted God's promises, was still ready to offer to God his only son, ||| Abrahambad alidag ash hab chehgig Isaac. Tsh wa g Jiosh am wabsh aꞌappe g Abrahambad mash eda d doakam mat wo mua g e‑alidag k hekaj ab wui wo iagchul.

<sax> even though he'd been told, “It's through Isaac that your descendants will be counted.” ||| Jiosh ash wa hab ahgid mat ab Isaacbad amjed wo i hihi g amjedkamaj.
<sax> Abraham had thought it through and decided that God could bring Isaac back to life from the dead. In a sense that's what did happen—Abraham received Isaac back from the dead. ||| Abrahambad o ab s‑wohochud mat g Jiosh wo e nako mat ab uhpam wo i wuhshad g Isaacbad muhkig amjed. K heg wa wepo mat hab e juh nat pi oi wa doꞌibia.

<sax> Trusting in God, Moses' parents hid him for three months after he was born. They recognized he was a special child. They weren't afraid to go against what the king had commanded. ||| Mosesbad jehj ash wa ab s‑wohochud g Jiosh. Kownal ash chum ha chehani g Tutuligo mat wo ha kokda g chechoj e‑aꞌaliga.

<sax> Trusting in God, he left Egypt and wasn't scared of Pharaoh's anger—he kept going with his eyes fixed on the invisible God. ||| Kutsh heg hekaj pi shaꞌi ehbeni g kownal k am dagito g Egypt jewed. Heg o wa wepo mo ab neid g pi ta neidagam Jiosh nash pi ab nakog g shoꞌigdag am wehhejed.
<sax> Trusting in God he observed the Passover and the sprinkling of blood, so that the destroying angel would not touch the Israelites. ||| Jiosh ash am ahgid g Mosesbad mat wo ha cheha g hemajkam mat wo ha kokda g kahwal mahmad k ab wui wo iagchul g ha‑ehꞌed ab e‑pupualit ab.

<sax> Trusting in God the Israelites crossed the Red Sea as if it were dry land. When the Egyptians attempted to do the same they were drowned. ||| Kush g Jiosh hab ha ahg g Tutuligo mat am gahi wo i huhud S‑wegi Kahchki oidch. Kutsh ab i s‑wohochud k hab e juh.

<sax> Trusting in God, Rahab the prostitute didn't die with those who rejected God, because she had welcomed the Israelite spies in peace. ||| Tsh am i wahp k wehs ha kokda hegam mo pi ab hu wohog elid g Jiosh.

<sax> God has given us something even better, so that they can't be complete without us. ||| Jiosh at hab masma apꞌech mat ab t‑wehm wo bei g baꞌich i s‑kehg apꞌedag.
<sax> For that reason, since we are surrounded by such a great crowd of people who gave evidence of their trust in God, let's get rid of everything that holds us back, the seductive sins that trip us up, and let's keep on running the race placed before us. ||| Neh, idam muꞌi hemajkam at e nako no pi ab s‑wohochud g Jiosh.

<sax> We should keep on looking to Jesus, the one who begins and completes our trust in God. Because of the joy ahead of him Jesus endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and sat down at the right hand of God's throne. ||| Pegih, tt hig am wo i t‑gewpkai Jesus wui.

<sax> Your resistance so far hasn't cost you blood as you fight against sin. ||| Koi amt haꞌichu shaꞌi nako ab wui gegokch g pi apꞌekam.
<sax> If you are not disciplined, (which everyone has experienced), then you are illegitimate and not true children. ||| Jiosh at si s‑koꞌokam wo em‑shohbidad. Kumt hekaj wo s‑mahchk mam d aꞌaligaj.
<sax> For if we respected our earthly fathers who disciplined us, shouldn't we even more be subject to the discipline of our spiritual Father which leads to life? ||| Neh, em‑jehj atp hems ab s‑gewkam haꞌichu em‑shohbi. Kum ab si has ha elid. Pegih, baꞌich o i matt ab wo i t‑dagito t‑ohg Jiosh wui k ab wo bei g pi ha huhugedam doakag.

But later on it produces peace in those who have been trained in this way so that they do what is right. ||| Pi o ta hohhoꞌidama mo hekid i s‑gewkam t‑shohbid g Jiosh.

<sax> Don't get distracted by different kinds of strange teachings. It's good for the mind to be convinced by grace, not by laws concerning what we eat.  Those who followed such laws didn't gain anything. ||| Kumt pi wo shaꞌi hiwigi mas g gawul mahs mashchama im hu hab wo i em‑juh ab amjed g s‑apꞌekam himdag.

<sax> And don't forget to do what is good, and to share with others what you have, for God is pleased when you make such sacrifices. ||| Pi g am haꞌasa hab wo juhni g s‑apꞌekam k ab wabsh aꞌai wo i e wehmajk. K id hab waꞌap heg wa wepo mo d t‑iagchulida. K g Jiosh s‑hohhoꞌid.
<sax> Follow your leaders, and do what they tell you, for they are watching out for you and are accountable. Act in such a way that they can do this happily—and not with sadness, for that wouldn't help you! ||| Ab g wo s‑ha wohog elidad g e‑wanimeddam.

<sax> Please pray for us. We're convinced we have acted in good conscience, always wanting to do what's right in every situation. ||| Am g wo wa tahnid g Jiosh mat wo i ni‑wehmajkad. Bani wabsh s‑junimk g s‑apꞌekam ch pi shaꞌi haꞌichu hab wua manis hekaj ni‑kudut.

<sax> I want to encourage you, brothers and sisters, to pay attention to what I've written to you in this short letter. ||| Neh, pi o shaꞌi chewaj ihda ni‑oꞌohana. Kuni ab si em‑ahgid ahpim ni‑wehm wohochuddam mamt wabsh si s‑ap e taht k wo kaiham k ab wo bei g i wehmtadag.

<sax> Give my greetings to all your leaders, and to all the believers there. The believers here in Italy send their greetings. ||| Am g wo ha ahgid g e‑wanimeddam ch wehs g t‑wehm wohochuddam mat ab wo i s‑t‑hoꞌigeꞌel. T‑wepnag iia Italy t am o am hab waꞌap s‑em‑hoꞌigeꞌid.
<sax> May God's grace be with all of you. Amen. ||| Jiosh at wo wa s‑em‑hoꞌigeꞌel.
<sax> My friends, choose to stay happy even when all kinds of troubles come your way, ||| Am g wabsh wo si s-ap e tahtkkad mat hekid ab wo em-aꞌahe g shoꞌigdag.
<sax> because you know that endurance comes from dealing with challenges to your trust in God.  Let your endurance become as strong as possible, so that you will be completely mature, without any shortcomings. ||| Id o aꞌappem g em-wohochudadag ch wo i gewkai. Kumt hab s-ap wo nahtoisk ch s-ap wo nakogad g e-shoꞌigdag.
<sax> If any of you need wisdom, ask God, who gives generously to everyone without holding back. ||| Haꞌijj amtp hems haꞌichu pi amichud. Kuni am em-ahgid mamt ab wo tai g Jiosh g amichudadag. T ab wo i em-mah. Jiosh o si s-baꞌama ab ha mamka g hemajkam mo haschu i tatchua ch pi ha kehꞌid.
<sax> But when you ask, remember to trust in God—don't have any doubts. Someone who doubts is like the crashing waves of the sea, tossed about and driven by the wind. ||| Mt wabshaba hemho wa wo s-wohochudad mat hab wo em-juni g Jiosh mam haschu ab i tahni. Hegam mo pi wohochud at wabsh haꞌichukaj wo e kudu hab sha masma mat g shuhdagi g hewelkaj wo e kudut k an aꞌai has wo e wuad.
<sax> Believers who are born poor should take pride in the high position they've been given, ||| Chum achs hems haꞌijj d shoꞌigkam ch eda wo chum si s-ap t-tahtkkad nat pi t-doꞌibia g Jiosh.
<sax> while the rich should “boast” in the humble position they now have, since they will fade away like flowers in the field. ||| Kut g s-kakais hab waꞌap wo chum si s-ap e tahtkkad e doꞌibiak. Jiosh o am wehs t-wepo t-haꞌichuchud. S-kakais at haꞌas s-hohtam gam hu hab wo i e juh mat g shoꞌigkam.
<sax> For the sun rises along with the blistering wind and scorches the grass. The flowers fall and their beauty is marred. Everything the rich achieve will fade in just the same way. ||| T g si s-has haꞌichu hab ha-juni wo huhug hab sha masma mat g haꞌichu wuhshanig wo huhug mat hekid wo gaksh g jewed am s-toni k ed.
<sax> Happy is anyone who patiently endures temptation, for when they've proved that they are trustworthy, they will receive the crown of life which God promises to those who love him. ||| Tt wo si s-ap t-tahtkk matt hekid s-ap ab wo nako g t-shoꞌigdag. Ab o t-mahkch g Jiosh g wechij doakag ahchim mach ab si tatchua ch am wo i t-wahpki e-kihdag ed matt hekid wehs wo gahi wuwha g t-aꞌappemadag.
<sax> Nobody should say when they're tempted, “I'm being tempted by God.” For God is not tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone. ||| Pi g hab wo shaꞌi chehꞌi mas g Jiosh hab chum em-wua mamtp wo sha pi ap nako g e-aꞌappemadag k hab wo juh g pi apꞌekam. Jiosh o pi hekid hab wua g pi apꞌekam ch pi hedai hab chum ha wua mas hab wo juh g pi apꞌekam.
<sax> Temptations come from our own evil desires that lead us astray and entrap us.  Such desires lead to sin, and sin, when it's fully developed, causes death. ||| Oꞌodham o wabsh hejel e-tatchuikaj hab wua g pi apꞌekam. T g Jiosh ab wo i ha mah g s-koꞌok namkidadag heg wehhejed.
<sax> My dear friends, don't be deceived. ||| Haꞌi o chum ha iattogid ch hab chechꞌe mo g pi apꞌekam ab d Jiosh amjedkam. Pi g ab hu wo shaꞌi ha wohochud, ahpim ni-wehm wohochuddam.
<sax> All that's good, every perfect gift, is from above, and comes down from the Father who made heaven's lights. Unlike them he doesn't change—he doesn't vary or cause shadows. ||| Jiosh at s-kehg nahto wehs haꞌichu. K wehs s-kehgaj hegai mo ab t-mahkch. Tash ch mashad ch huhuꞌu hebaichuj pi ab hu t-mahkch g tonlig no pi g jewed e nodgid. K wabshaba g Jiosh pi hekid gawul e wua ch chum hekid tonlidch g t-chegitoidag g wohokamkaj.
<sax> because human anger doesn't reflect the good character of God. ||| Pi at hab masma wo i e apꞌech g pi em-apꞌedag. Jiosh at am wo waꞌi apꞌech g pi t-apꞌedag.
<sax> So get rid of all that's filthy and evil. Humbly accept the word that's been implanted within you—for this is what can save you. ||| Gam g hu hab wo i juhni wehs haꞌichu mo s-bihtagi am em-chegitoi ed ch am em-doakag ed. Ab g wabsh wo i e shoꞌigchud Jiosh wui k ab wo i s-wohoch g haꞌichu ahgaj. Kut heg hekaj wo em-doꞌibia.
<sax> But do what the word says—don't just listen to it and delude yourselves. ||| Pi g am wo hejel e iattogidad mamt wabsh wo kaihamad g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch eda pi am hu hab wo junihid.
<sax> If you just listen to the word, and don't act on it, it's like staring at your own face in a mirror. ||| Jiosh oꞌohana o hab sha masma mo g neidakud matt heg eda ab wo i t-neid k wo cheh mo haschu pi kehg hab mahs am t-doakag ed.
<sax> You see yourself, but then you leave, and immediately forget what you looked like. ||| Pi g gam hu wabsh wo hihim pi am hu i chegitok mo has mahs g em-doakag
<sax> But if you look to the perfect law of freedom and follow it, not as someone who just listens and then forgets, but as someone who acts on it—then you will be blessed in what you do. ||| k wabshaba am wo si oidahid g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch am hab wo junihid. T g Jiosh ab wo si i s-em-hoꞌigeꞌid k ab wo i em-wehmt wehs haꞌichu hab em-juni ed. Kut g haꞌichu ahgaj ab wo i em-wuwhas pi apꞌekam t amjed.
<sax> If you think you're religious, but don't control what you say, you deceive yourself—your religion is pointless. ||| Hegam mo hedai hab kaij mo d Jiosh wohochuddam ch eda wo pi ap neneokad o wabsh hejel e iattogid. K g ha-himdag pi haꞌichu wehhejed s-kehgajk.
<sax> In the eyes of our God and Father, religion that's pure and genuine is to visit orphans and widows in their suffering, and to keep yourself from being contaminated by the world. ||| Bo d elidag g Jiosh mat g t-wohochudadag haꞌichu wehhejed wo s-kehgajk. Hemho wa att wo si t-nuhkudad mat pi wo t-padch g jewed t ab haꞌichu. Kut hab ep wo t-juh g t-wohochudadag matt haꞌichukaj wo i ha wehmajk hegam mo d heheꞌejel wihpkam uꞌuwi ch aꞌal.

<sax> haven't you discriminated and judged with bad motives? ||| Pi o apꞌe g em-tatchui mamtp ha baꞌich ab wo i haꞌichuch g s-kais oꞌodham.
<sax> Listen, my dear friends: Didn't God choose those who the world considers poor to be rich in their trust in him, and to inherit the kingdom he promised to those who love him? ||| Jiosh ash ab ha makiog g shoꞌig hemajkam g geꞌe wohochudadag mat am wo apꞌedagk kihdaj ed. Kutsh wehsijj ab wo i ha wahpki hegam mo ab tatchua.
<sax> But you've treated the poor shamefully. Isn't it the rich who oppress you and drag you before the courts? ||| M eda haꞌi pi ab hu has ha elid g shoꞌigkam ch hegam waꞌi s-kakais ab si has ha elid. Am g wo i oidahim mo haꞌi g s-kakais em-shoꞌigchud ch am i em-wahpkid chehanig ch ed
<sax> Don't they insult the honorable name of the one who called you and to whom you belong? ||| ch s-koꞌokam has ahg hegai mach ab ihm mo d t-doꞌibiakam.
<sax> If you really observe the royal law of Scripture: “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” then you do well. ||| Am g hab wo junihid g Jiosh chehanig mo hab masma an oꞌohanas:
<sax> You should speak and act as people who will be judged by the law of freedom.  Anyone who doesn't show mercy will be judged without mercy. Yet mercy wins out over judgment! ||| T wabshaba g Jiosh gam hu hab i juh g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig mat wo t‑doꞌibia ab amjed g s‑koꞌok t‑namkidadag mat hekid wo t‑lodai.

Pi at ab hu wo i ha hoꞌigeꞌel g Jiosh hegam mat pi ab hu wo ha hoꞌigeꞌidad g hemajkam.
<sax> My friends, what's the good of someone saying they trust in God when they don't do what's right? Can such “trust” save them? ||| Pi o woho d Jiosh wohochuddam hegam mat pi hab wo junihid g tatchuij. Kut pi wo ha doꞌibia. Haꞌichu hab t‑juni at wo t‑wohokamch machs d wohochuddam.
<sax> If a brother or sister doesn't have clothes, or food for the day, ||| Neh, matp hems haꞌi g t‑wehm wohochuddam d wo shoꞌigkamk ch wo haꞌichu si tatchua.
<sax> Someone may argue, “You have your trust in God; I have my good deeds.” Well, show me your trust in God without good deeds, and I will show you my trust in God by my good deeds! ||| Haꞌijj amki hab e elid mamt ab wabsh wo s‑wohochudad g Jiosh ch eda pi am hu hab wo junihid g tatchuij. K eda hab chuꞌig mat g haꞌichu hab t‑juni wo tashogi g t‑wohochudadag.
<sax> You believe that God is one God? That's great—but demons believe in God too, and they're scared of him! ||| Jijawul o hab waꞌap chum s‑wohochud mo an hema d Jiosh ch shaꞌi si s‑ehbid ch eda pi am hu hab junihim g tatchuij ch hab masma e chehgidch mo pi d shaꞌi e doꞌibiakam.
<sax> You foolish people! Don't you know that trust in God without doing what's right is worthless? ||| K heg hekaj tasho mo pi woho wohochud g Jiosh hegam matp hedai pi hab wo junihid g e‑wohochudadag. Am ant haꞌichu ep wo em‑ahgi mant hekaj wo si tasho em‑chehgi ihda.
<sax> Wasn't our father Abraham made right by what he did—by offering his son Isaac on the altar? ||| Ab ach d amjedkam hegai mash hab chehgig Abraham. Kush heg ab s‑wohochud g Jiosh. Tsh g Jiosh am cheha matsh ab wui wo iagchul g e‑alidag muꞌak. Tsh g Abrahambad am woho hab chum juh k hekaj e chehgid mo ab s‑wohochud g Jiosh ch d e doꞌibiakam. Tsh g Jiosh am hahawa pi hiwigi mas wo mua g e‑alidag no pi wabsh aꞌappem g wohochudadgaj.
<sax> You notice that his trust in God worked together with what he did, and through what he did his trust in God was made complete. ||| Abrahambad at ab wehnad g haꞌichu hab e‑juni g e‑wohochudadag. Wohochudadgaj at s‑ap i e nahto heg hekaj haꞌichu hab junij.
<sax> In this way scripture was fulfilled: “Abraham trusted God, and this was considered as him doing right, and he was called the friend of God.” ||| T hekaj am e wohokamch hegai mo an oꞌohanas:
<sax> In the same way, wasn't Rahab the prostitute made right by what she did when she looked after the messengers and then sent them away by a different road? ||| Am g wo s‑chegitok mo haschu an oꞌohanas ab amjed g Rahabbad. Heg atsh wa haꞌi ha doꞌibia g t‑shohshonbad mash eda g wehmaj oꞌodham s‑ha kokdaimk. Id at am wohokamch mo ab s‑wohochud g Jiosh. Kutsh g Jiosh doꞌibia.
<sax> Just as the body is dead without the spirit, trust in God is dead if you don't do what's right. ||| Pegih, am ach t‑chehgidch g haꞌichu hab t‑junikaj mach haschu ab i s‑wohochud. K hegam mat pi am hu hab wo junihid g Jiosh tatchui pi ab hu wohochud g Jiosh.
<sax> We put bridles into the mouths of horses so that they'll obey us, and we can direct them wherever we want. ||| Chum as si chumaj g t‑nehni ch eda d si s‑has haꞌichu hab masma mo g pilin. Pilin o d al chum haꞌichu. Kutt eda wo pilindad g kawyu k hekaj wo t‑nako matt wo i nodagi mattp hebai wo i s‑nodgidam.
<sax> Look at ships as well: even though they're very big and are driven along by strong winds, they're steered by a very small rudder in the direction the pilot wants to go. ||| Nt ep wo wepogi g wahlko nodgidakud matt hekaj wo i nodagi g geꞌe wahlko, chum as has masma s‑gewkam wo medad g hewel.
<sax> In just the same way the tongue is a very small part of the body, but it makes great boasts! Think how a big forest can be set on fire by a very small flame! ||| Nt ep wo wepogi g al chum chuhdagi mat muꞌi wo mehi g uꞌus. Pegih, k am wa tasho matt hab waꞌap wo t‑nako matt geꞌe haꞌichu wo padch g t‑neꞌokikaj.
<sax> And the tongue is a fire! The tongue is a world of evil among the parts of the body. It disgraces all you are as a person, and can burn down the whole of your life, since it is set on fire by Gehenna. ||| Pi kehg neꞌoki o ab d Jiawul amjedkam. Kutt hekaj wo padch g t‑chegitoi ch t‑doakag hab masma neneokch.
<sax> People have tamed all kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and sea creatures, ||| T wo e nako g hemajkam mat wabsh chum has mahs haꞌichu doakam wo mahshoch nat pi ha mahshoch g jewed t ab haꞌichu oiopodam ch haꞌichu daꞌadam ch wahammad ch waptopi.
<sax> but no one can tame the tongue—it's an evil thing, hard to control, full of deadly poison. ||| T wabshaba pi hedai wo e nako mas wo hejel dodolimagi g e‑nehni. Chum o hekid e nahtokch mat hab wo juh g pi ap neꞌoki k hekaj wo padch g t‑chegitoi.
<sax> We use the same tongue to bless our Lord and Father, as well as to curse people who are made in God's image— ||| Hebaichujj ach i dagitokch g t‑nehni am Jiosh wui ch hekaj hehgchulid ch eda hebaichujj has ha ahg g hemajkam. K eda g hemajkam d Jiosh nahtoi. T e wepo masma chum ha nahto.
<sax> blessings and curses come from the same mouth! Friends, it shouldn't be this way! ||| Id o heg wa wepo mach has ahg g Jiosh mach eda chum hehgchulid.
<sax> Who among you has wisdom and understanding? Let their good lives demonstrate what they do—doing what is right with wise kindness and consideration. ||| Pi g hab wabsh wo chehꞌi mam s‑chu amichud. Bag wo juhnid g s‑apꞌekam ch hab masma wo e chehgi mam s‑chu amichud.
<sax> But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your heart, don't boast about it and don't lie against the truth. ||| Pi g am wo ha iattogidad ch pi wo chum ge e haschudad mo ab em‑mahkch g Jiosh g amichudadag mamtp wo s‑ta keꞌidamak ch wo s‑chu hehgamkk ch ep wo s‑chu daꞌad.
<sax> This kind of “wisdom” doesn't come from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, and demonic. ||| Pi o ab hu d Jiosh amjedkam hegai s‑ta keꞌidamadag ch s‑chu hehgamdadag ch s‑chu daꞌamkam. T pi hab wo chum chuꞌigk hegam mo e doꞌibiakch. Do wabsh jewed dahm haꞌichu ch ab d amjedkamaj g Jiawul hegai hab mahs haꞌichu.
<sax> Wherever there is jealousy and selfish ambition you'll also find confusion and all kinds of evil practices. ||| Muꞌi o haꞌichu pi apꞌe mo hebai hab chuꞌig g s‑chu hehgamdadag ch s‑chu daꞌamkam. Wehs nahnko mahs pi apꞌekam o am hab chuꞌig.
<sax> However, wisdom that comes from above is first of all pure, and it also brings peace. It is kind and open to reason. It is full of mercy and produces good things. It is genuine and not hypocritical. ||| Kuch wabshaba ahchim mach uꞌukch g amichudadag ab Jiosh t amjed d hekia s‑apꞌekam ch s‑dodolima ch ab ha oꞌodhamchud g hemajkam ch s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌid ch ha wehm s‑hemajim neneok ch pi ha iattogid.
<sax> Those who sow peace will harvest the peace of what is truly right. ||| Am g wo ha dodolimachud g hemajkam. Kut g Jiosh am wo i ha apꞌech mat am hahawa hab wo junihid g s‑apꞌekam.
<sax> Where do the fights and quarrels you're having come from? Aren't they due to the sensual passions that are in conflict within you? ||| Haꞌijj amsh am aꞌai e kamꞌon ch e cheggia mam eda d chum e doꞌibiakam. Nt wo em‑ahgi mam hab masma hab e wua nam pi haꞌichu s‑behimk mo pi ab hu d em‑wuikam
<sax> You burn with desire, but don't get what you want. You kill for what you lust after, but don't get what you're looking for. You argue and you fight, but you don't get anything, because you don't pray for it. ||| ch wo ha cheggia k wo ha mua mamt wo bei. K eda g Jiosh ab chum em‑makiog mam haschu i tatchua. Ab g wabsh wo tahni. T wo em‑mah. Pi am edgid nam pi pi ab hu tahni.
<sax> Do you think Scripture doesn't mean what it says: that the spirit that he put in us is very jealous? ||| K wabshaba an hab chuꞌig Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana ed mash g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ab wui kehk g pi ap t‑tatchui.
<sax> But God gives us even more grace, as Scripture says: “God is against those who are arrogant, but gives grace to those who are humble.” ||| Bo wa masma ab t‑makiog g Jiosh g gewkdag matt pi hab wo junihid g hejel t‑tatchui. Bo chuꞌig g oꞌohanaj:
<sax> So place yourself under God's direction. Confront the devil, and he will run away from you. ||| Mt heg hekaj ab wo i e dagito Jiosh wui k ab wui wo gegokkad g ge Jiawul mamt pi hab wo junihid g tatchuij. T g Jiawul s‑hohtam wo i e mehkod ab em‑amjed.

<sax> Be humble before the Lord and he will lift you up. ||| Ab g wo i e shoꞌigchud wui g Jiosh. T heg ab wo si em‑haꞌichuch.
<sax> Friends, don't speak badly of one another. Anyone who criticizes a fellow-believer and condemns them, criticizes and condemns the law. If you condemn the law you're not someone who keeps the law, because you're sitting in judgment of it. ||| Pi g am wo aꞌai has e ahgad, ahpim ni‑wehm wohochuddam. Hegam mat hab wo e junihid o ab wui gegok hegai chehanig mo hab chuꞌig matt ab aꞌai wo si pihk t‑elidad. Heg o wa wepo mo hudawk mas s‑apꞌe g Jiosh chehanig.

<sax> There's only one lawgiver and judge—the one who can either save or destroy you—so who are you to judge your neighbor? ||| Heg at wo waꞌi t‑lodai mo hedai t‑mahkch g chehanig.

<sax> What you should say is, “If it's the Lord's will, we'll live like this and plan to do that.” ||| Bamt wo chum chei, “Matp d wo Jiosh tatchuik, kutt hab wo juh haꞌichu.”
<sax> But right now you're caught up in your vain ideas. All this boasting is evil. ||| M eda am ge e hahaschud mamt haschu hab wo juh. Pi o apꞌe mams hab masma wo ge hahaschudad.
<sax> For it is a sin if you know to do what's right but don't do it. ||| Kut d wo pi ap chuꞌijkamk matp hedai pi am hu hab wo junihid g s‑apꞌekam mo eda s‑mahch mat has wo chum e juh.
<sax> Come on, you rich people! You should weep and wail for all the problems that are coming your way!  Your wealth is ruined, and your clothes have been eaten by moths.  Your gold and your silver are corroded, and this corrosion will be evidence against you, eating away your flesh like fire. You hoarded up your wealth in these last days. ||| Ab g wo kaiham mant haschu wo oꞌoha mamtp hedai s‑e kakaischud hab wuadch g pi apꞌekam. Bamki chum e elid mamt geꞌe haꞌichu wo edgidad kekeltk.

<sax> Look, the wages of your farm workers that you cheated are crying out against you—the cries of the farm workers have reached the ears of the Lord Almighty.  You've enjoyed a life of luxury here on earth, full of self-indulgent pleasure, fattening yourselves up for the day of slaughter!  You have condemned and killed the innocent who didn't even resist you. ||| Em‑kaisdag o si geꞌej ch wohokamchud mam pi ap ha namkid g e‑pionag.

<sax> Friends, be patient as you wait for the Lord's return. Think of the farmer waiting patiently for the earth's precious harvest as it grows with the early and later rains. ||| Pegih neh, ahpim ni‑wehm wohochuddam, am g wabsh wo s‑e tahtk ch nenida mat ep wo jiwia g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ.

<sax> My friends, don't complain about each other, so you won't be judged. Look, the judge is standing right at the door! ||| E o nahtokch mat hab wo juh g lodaita.
<sax> Above all, my friends, don't swear. Not by heaven, not by earth, and not by any other kind of oath. Just let your yes be yes, and your no be no, so you won't fall under condemnation. ||| Am g hab wabsh wo juhni mamt haschu hedai wo i ha ahgi mamt hab wo juh.

<sax> Are any of you suffering? You should pray. Are some of you cheerful? You should sing songs of praise. ||| Nam am hu haꞌi haꞌichukaj i e kudut? Pegih, e g wo hoꞌigeꞌidahun.
<sax> Are any of you sick? You should call for the church elders and have them pray over you, and anoint you with oil in the Lord's name. ||| Nam am hu haꞌi kokꞌo?

<sax> Admit the wrongs you've done to each other, and pray for one another so that you'll be healed. Earnest prayer from those who live right is very effective. ||| Kumt heg hekaj ab aꞌai wo e ahgi g pi ap e‑chuꞌijig k wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahu aꞌai e wehhejed. T wo em‑doaj g Jiosh.

<sax> Elijah was a man who had the same human nature as we do. He prayed earnestly that it wouldn't rain, and it didn't rain on the earth for three and a half years. ||| Heg at hekaj hab e juh mash haschu g Elijabad ab tahni g Jiosh.

<sax> My friends, if any one of you strays from the truth and someone brings you back,  let them know that whoever rescues a sinner from the error of their ways will save them from death, and will gain forgiveness for many sins. ||| Neh, tp hems hema wo heb hu hih g em‑wehm wohochuddam ab amjed g wohokam.

<sax> God sent a man named John. ||| Am ad hema i kei g Jiosh g oꞌodham mat wo t-mihshmad. D id hab chehgig John.

<sax> He himself was not the light, but he came to witness to the light. ||| Pi ad hejel hab e ahg g John ch wabsh heg an ahgachug mad in i wuhsh.
<sax> The true light was coming into the world to give light to everyone. ||| Id o d wohokam tonlig ch am tonlidch g wehs hemajkam ha-chegitoidag.

<sax> The Word became human and lived among us, and we saw his glory, the glory of the Father's one and only Son, full of grace and truth. John gave his testimony about him, shouting out to the people, “This is the one I was telling you about when I said, ‘The one who is coming after me is more important than me, for before I ever existed he already was.’ ”  We have all been recipients of his generous nature, one gracious gift after another. ||| Hegai mo d Jiosh Neꞌoki ad e wepogi g hemajkam k woho t-wepo chuꞌig ch ia t-shahgid d doakam.

<sax> This is what John publicly stated when the Jewish leaders sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, “Who are you?” ||| Am ad t‑mihshmad ihda John tohono jewed ch ed.

<sax> John declared plainly and clearly without hesitation, “I am not the Messiah.” ||| D ab wabsh si ha wehm neok g John ch am si tasho ha ahgid mo pi d hegai.
<sax> “So then, who are you?” they asked. “Elijah?” ||| D ab ep kakke, “Aha nap d hegai Elijabad ch ia uhpam jiwia?”

<sax> This all happened in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing. ||| Neh, wehs ihda ad hab e juh gan hu aigojed g Jordan akimel mo am d wahlko kih.
<sax> The next day John saw Jesus approaching him, and said, “Look, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world! ||| Am baꞌich d i tash, d am jiwia g Jesus John wui.
<sax> This is the one I was talking about when I said, ‘A man who is coming after me is more important than me, for before I ever existed he already was.’ ||| Id ani hab ahg mani wa hab em‑ahgid mat ab wabsh ni‑oidk wo i wuhshani k wabshaba wehs ha baꞌich d i si haꞌichu no pi chum hekid an haꞌichug.

<sax> John gave his evidence about him, saying, “I saw the Spirit descend from heaven like a dove and rest upon him.  I wouldn't have known him except he who sent me to baptize with water had told me, ‘The one you see the Spirit descend to and rest upon, he is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.’ ||| D am hebai i cheka, d si s‑mahch ch ahg g John hab kaijch, “Bo kaij g Jiosh ab ni‑wui, ‘Ab at wo i hud g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag k ab wo e ul si ni‑Kehsha ab.

<sax> When the two disciples heard what he said they went and followed Jesus. ||| Kuchd am i kah ahchim gohk k gam hu i oi g Jesus.
<sax> Jesus turned round and saw them following him. “What are you looking for?” he asked them, ||| D ab haꞌab i e wua k ab i t‑neid k hab kaij, “Shahchu am tatchua?”
<sax> “Come and see,” he told them. So they went with him and saw where he was staying. It was about four p.m., and they spent the rest of the day with him. ||| D hab kaij, “Oi g wo ni‑oid k wo nei mani hebai da.”
<sax> Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of these two disciples who had heard what John said and followed Jesus. ||| Hegai mad ni‑wehm kah g John ch am i oi g Jesus o hab chehgig Andrew. K g wehngaj ihda hab chehgig Simon.
<sax> He went at once to find his brother Simon and told him, “We've found the Messiah! (which means ‘Christ’).” ||| K g Andrew d wehpegkam mat am i gahghi g e‑wehnag k hekid am i chehg k hab ahgid, “Cheh att hegai moki d Christ.” (Id o hab d ahga ‘Jiosh si Kehsha.’)
<sax> He took him to Jesus. Looking directly at Simon, Jesus said, “You are Simon, son of John. But now you will be called Cephas, (which means ‘Peter’).” ||| D g Andrew am hahawa uꞌapa Jesus wui.
<sax> The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. Jesus found Philip there, and told him, “Follow me.”  Philip was from Bethsaida, the same town that Andrew and Peter came from. ||| Am baꞌich d i tash, d hab i e ah g Jesus mat gam hu wo hih Galilee chekshani wui.

Jesus ad am cheh g Philip k hab kaij ab wui, “Ab g i ni-oid k wo ni-wehmajk.”
<sax> As Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, he said about him, “Look, here's a true Israelite! There's nothing false about him.” ||| D ga hu haha wabsh i hihim.
<sax> “How do you know who I am?” Nathanael asked. ||| D g Nathanael hab kaij, “P has masma s-ni-mahch?”
<sax> “Rabbi, you are the Son of God, the king of Israel!” Nathaniel exclaimed. ||| D hab kaij g Nathanael, “Ih, neh, kupki d Jiosh alidag ch d t-kownalig ahchim Tutuligo hemajkam.”
<sax> “You believe this just because I told you I saw you under the fig tree?” Jesus replied. “You'll get to see much more than that!” ||| D hab kaij g Jesus, “Ab ap ni-hiwig nani pi am wabsh tonlid ch m-neid. Nt wo si shel m-ahgi mapt baꞌich i s-ta neidamam haꞌichu wo nei imhab i baꞌich.
<sax> Then Jesus said, “I tell you the truth, you will all see heaven open, and the angels of God going up and down on the Son of man.” ||| Dani Jiosh si Kehsha ch am wo kuhpiꞌo g dahm kahchim am em-wehhejed. Kumt wo nei mat am wui wo i chehchsh g anghil ab ni-amjed k ab ni-wui ep wo i huhud.”
<sax> Two days later a wedding was held at Cana in Galilee, and Jesus' mother was there. ||| Am gohk d i tash amjed, tsh am haꞌi wo e hohont Cana kihhim t am. Ihda Cana o am Galilee chekchani ch ed. K am haꞌichug g Jesus jeꞌe.
<sax> Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. ||| Kumd ahchim ab i t-wai. Chd am hihi g Jesus wehm k am haꞌichug. Kumd am hahawa hab juh g gegosig.
<sax> The wine ran out, so Jesus' mother told him, “They don't have any more wine.” ||| D wabshaba am i huh g nawait. D g Jesus jeꞌe ab wui hab kaij, “Huh at g ha-nawait.”
<sax> Standing nearby were six stone jars used by the Jews for ceremonial washing, each one holding twenty to thirty gallons. ||| K eda d t-himdag ahchim Tutuligo mach muꞌi haꞌichu has masma wapkon.

<sax> “Fill the jars with water,” Jesus told them. So they filled them right up. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus am ha wui g pion, “Am g wo i ha shuhshud g shuhdagikaj.”
<sax> Then he told them, “Pour some out, and take it to the master of ceremonies.” So they took him some. ||| D hab hahawa ep ha ahg, “Am g wo wassibi k wo mah hegai mo nuhkud g e-hohontam piast.”
<sax> The master of ceremonies didn't know where it had come from, only the servants knew. But when he tasted the water that had been turned to wine, he called the bridegroom over. ||| D ab jeh mo d si s-kehg nawait k eda pi mahch mas hebai waꞌi. Hegam o hi wa s-mahch pion mat hebai waꞌi.
<sax> “Everyone serves out the best wine first,” he told him, “and once people have had plenty to drink, then they put out the cheaper wine. But you have kept the best wine till last!” ||| D am i cheh g ha-hohntam am i jehk g nawait k hab kaij ab wui, “Shaꞌi s-ap ab kahk ihda nawait.

<sax> This was the very first of Jesus' miraculous signs, and was performed in Cana of Galilee. Here he revealed his glory, and his disciples put their trust in him. ||| Neh, k id d si wehpeg s-hasig haꞌichu hab junij g Jesus. D am mahsko wua g e-gewkdag. Kuchd ab si s-wohochud mo woho d Jiosh si Kehsha.
<sax> After this Jesus left for Capernaum with his mother, brothers, and disciples where they stayed for a few days. ||| D am hahawa hab i e ah g Jesus matt am wo hihi Capernaum kihhim wui. D g jeꞌej ch wepngaj ep t-oi. Ch am haꞌichugkahim heꞌekia tash.
<sax> Since it was almost time for the Jewish Passover, Jesus went on to Jerusalem. ||| Wehs ahid ab o am e wushshad Jerusalem t am matsh wa g Jiosh ha doꞌibia g t‑shohshon. Kud am i e ai. Kuchd gam hu hihim
<sax> He ordered the dove-sellers, “Take these things out of here! Don't turn my Father's house into a market!” ||| k hab ha ahg hegam mo g hohohi ha gagda mat gam hu wo i ha wuwhas hab kaijch, “Pi g hab wo shaꞌi juhni g ni‑ohg kih mat d wabsh wo haꞌichu gagdakudk.”
<sax> His disciples remembered the Scripture that says, “My devotion for your house is like a fire burning inside me!” ||| Kuchd am hahawa i chegito mo g Jiosh heki oꞌohana hab chuꞌig:
<sax> The Jewish leaders reacted, asking him, “What right do you have to do this? Show us some miraculous sign to prove it!” ||| D ab si chehmo g hahaꞌichu k hab ahg, “Shahchu ap ahgch hab wua ihda? Am g hig t‑chehgid g s‑hasig haꞌichu. Kutt hab wo s‑mahchk map uꞌukch g e‑gewkdag ab amjed g Jiosh.”
<sax> Jesus replied, “Destroy this Temple, and in three days I'll raise it up!” ||| D hab kaij g Jesus, “Pegih oig, m ant wo wa em‑chehgi g s‑hasig haꞌichu. Mt wo padch ihda mo g Jiosh am eda kih. Kunt ahni ep wo i kegch mat d wo i waik tashk.”
<sax> “It took forty-six years to build this Temple, and you're going to raise it up in three days?” the Jewish leaders replied. ||| D idam si e shoꞌoshodkad k hab kaij, “Giꞌikko gamai chuhdp (46) aꞌahid ab at hahawa i e nahto ihda geꞌe cheopi. Kuptp eda ahpi waik tash ab ia wo i kei.”
<sax> But the Temple Jesus was speaking of was his body. ||| K eda g Jesus hejel hab e ahg mat wo e muhkid k uhpam ep wo e chegito.
<sax> After he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered what he said, and so they believed in Scripture and Jesus' own words. ||| Kutt s‑chegito g neꞌokij mat hekid uhpam e chegito am e muhkidk. Neh, bo chuꞌig g Jiosh oꞌohana mat uhpam wo e chegito g Jiosh si Kehsha. Kutt hahawa s‑amichud k ab s‑wohoch.
<sax> As a result of the miracles Jesus did while he was in Jerusalem during the Passover, many believed in him.  But Jesus did not trust himself to them, because he knew all about people. ||| Am achd haꞌichugkahim Jerusalem t am wehs oidam g t‑shohshon ha‑doꞌibiadag wuhshda. Kud muꞌijj ab i s‑wohoch g Jesus.

<sax> He came at night to where Jesus was and said, “Rabbi, we know you are a teacher who has come from God, for nobody could do the miraculous signs you're doing unless God was with him.” ||| Kuchd am hu hebai dadha chuhug ch ed.

<sax> “How can you be reborn when you're old?” Nicodemus asked. “You can't go back into your mother's womb and be born a second time!” ||| D hab kaij g Nicodemas, “Tt has hig masma ep wo mahsi heki hu kelitk. Aha natt am ep wo i wah t‑jeꞌe ed k ep wo mahsi?”
<sax> “I tell you the truth, you can't enter God's kingdom unless you are born of water and the Spirit,” Jesus told him.  “What's born of the flesh is flesh, and what's born of the Spirit is Spirit. ||| D g Jesus hab kaij, “Piaꞌa.

<sax> The wind blows wherever it wants, and just as you hear the sound it makes, but don't know where it's coming from or where it's going, that's how it is for everyone who is born of the spirit.” ||| Neh, kah ap g hewel m an hewelhog.

<sax> “How is this possible?” Nicodemus asked. ||| D g Nicodemas hab kaij, “A, kus has masma hab chuꞌig?”
<sax> “You're a famous teacher in Israel,  and yet you don't understand such things?” Jesus replied. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus, “Aha, nap pi amichud ch eda d wa chum ge uhgk ha mashchamdam g Tutuligo?

<sax> Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so the Son of man must be lifted up, ||| D hab ep kaij g Jesus, “An o hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed matsh wa g t‑shohshonbad muꞌi e keꞌij g kohkꞌoikaj mash eda am oiopo tohono jewed ch ed.

<sax> that everyone who trusts in him will have eternal life. ||| Kutp hedai ab wo ni‑hiwig k wo e doꞌibia ab amjed g pi ap e‑chuꞌijig.” Neh, bad kaij g Jesus.
<sax> For God loved the world, and this is how:  he gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who trusts in him shouldn't die, but have eternal life. ||| Pegih neh, ab o si t‑tatchua g Jiosh ch hiwigi g e‑alidag mat am i e dagito k e muhkid am t‑wehhejed mach d pi ap chuꞌijkam.

<sax> God didn't send the Son into the world to condemn the world, but to save the world through him. ||| Jiosh at am cheha g e‑alidag mat in wo i wuhsh jewed dahm k wo ha doꞌibia g hemajkam. Kut pi heg hekaj in i wuhsh mas ab wo haꞌichu t‑mohtoꞌi.
<sax> Those who trust in him are not condemned, while those who don't trust in him are condemned  already because they didn't trust in the one and only Son of God. ||| Pi o ab hu haꞌichu mohtoꞌis hegam mo ab hiwig g Jiosh alidag. Hegam o ab heki hu haꞌichu mohtoꞌis mo pi ab hu hiwig.
<sax> This is how the decision  is made: the light came to the world, but people loved the darkness rather than the light, for their actions were evil.  All those who do evil hate the light and don't come into the light, because they don't want their actions to be exposed. ||| Ia at jiwia jewed dahm hegai mo woho tonlidch g t‑chegitoidag.

<sax> When Jesus realized that the Pharisees had discovered that he was gaining and baptizing more disciples than John,  (although it wasn't Jesus who was baptizing, but his disciples), ||| D baꞌich i muꞌi hemajkam ab him Jesus wui mo ab wui g John kch ab wecho e mashcham.

<sax> On the way he had to pass through Samaria. ||| K eda idam ha shahgid chechkshani am hab chuꞌig g Samaria chekshani.
<sax> So he came to the Samaritan city of Sychar, near to the field that Jacob had given his son Joseph.  Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, who was tired from the journey, sat straight down beside the well. It was around noon. ||| Kuchd heg am gai hihimad ch gam hu ai g Sychar kihhim mat am dahm juh.

<sax> A Samaritan woman came to fetch water. Jesus said to her, “Please could you give me a drink?”  for his disciples had gone to the town to buy food. ||| Kuchd ahchim gam hu hihi kihhim wui matt wo ha nolawt g haꞌichu hugi. D an hema i t‑bij g uwi waꞌigamedam k atsh am jiwia mo am daha g Jesus.
<sax> “You're a Jew, and I'm a Samaritan woman. How can you ask me for a drink?” the woman replied, for Jews don't associate with Samaritans. ||| Sh hab kaij g uwi, “Neh, dapki Tuhligo. Ni ahni d Samaria t am oꞌodham. P haschu ahgch ab ni‑tahni g wasib?” Neh, bash kaij nach pi s‑ha uhwaid ch chum hems g haꞌu pi ha wehm wo ha hekaj.
<sax> Jesus answered her, “If you only recognized God's gift, and who is asking you, ‘Please could you give me a drink?’ you would have asked him and he would have given you the water of life.” ||| Sh g Jesus hab epai kaij ab wui, “Ahpi apt aigo ab wo haꞌichu ni‑tai maptp wo s‑mahchk mani hedai wud ch haschu i m‑makiog. Hegai mani m‑makiog o ab Jiosh d amjedkam ch heg wepogidas mo g shonkam shuhdagi.”
<sax> Jesus answered, “Everyone who drinks water from this well will become thirsty again. ||| Sh g Jesus hab kaij, “Huhume o g shuhdagi m‑waꞌigi. Kup ep tonommek.
<sax> But those who drink the water I give won't ever be thirsty again. The water I give becomes a bubbling spring of water inside them, bringing them eternal life.” ||| T wabshaba pi hekid wo huhug hegai mani ahni m‑makiog. Heg at am wo m‑edak ch hab wo masmak mo g shonkam ch ab wo m‑mah g pi ha huhugedam doakag.”
<sax> “Sir,” replied the woman, “Please give me this water so I won't be thirsty, and I won't have to come here to fetch water!” ||| Sh hab kaij g uwi, “Ih, pegih, si g s‑ni‑hoꞌigeꞌid k ab i ni‑mahki ihda shuhdagi mant pi hekid ep wo tonom k pi wo ge i waꞌigammedad.”
<sax> “Go and call your husband, and come back here,” Jesus told her. ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “Pegih, k ab wo i wai g e‑kun.”
<sax> “I don't have a husband,” the woman answered. ||| Sh g uwi hab kaij, “Pi ani ha kun.”
<sax> “You've had five husbands, and the one you're living with now is not your husband. So what you say is true!” ||| Hetasp ap waꞌi ha kuhkunkahim. K hegai map hemuch an wehm kih pi d m‑kun.”
<sax> “I can see you're a prophet, sir,” the woman replied. ||| Tsh ab wabsh ge nen k kekiwua g uwi k hab kaij, “Ih, dapki ge Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam!
<sax> “Tell me this: our ancestors worshiped here on this mountain, but you say that Jerusalem is where we must worship.” ||| Pegih neh, am g ni‑ahgid mam haschu ahgch ahpim Tutuligo hab chechꞌe mo g Jerusalem d waꞌi amai mat am wo e ihmad g Jiosh. Ch eda ahchim Samaria t am kihkam ia haꞌab ihm mo hebai g t‑shohshon ihmahim id ab doꞌag.”
<sax> But the time is coming—and in fact it's here already—when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth, for these are the kind of worshipers the Father wants. ||| E at ai g tash mat g hemajkam si e‑ihbdag amjed woho ab wo ihmad g e‑ohg Jiosh. Bo masma hab ha elid g Jiosh mat hab masma ab wo ihmad.
<sax> God is Spirit, so worshipers must worship in spirit and in truth.” ||| Do wabsh doakag g Jiosh ch pi ha honshpadag mams am hebai wo kihchud k heg waꞌi eda wo ihmad. Pegih, mt wabsh chum hebai wo ihmad ch wehs e‑ihbdag amjed.”
<sax> The woman said, “Well, I know that the Messiah is coming,” (the one who is called Christ). “When he comes he will explain it all to us.” ||| Sh am wabsh shaꞌi pi amichud g uwi ch hab kaij ab wui, “Heg ani hi wa s‑mahch mat wo jiwia hegai mo d Jiosh si Kehsha ch hab e aꞌaga Christ k wehs haꞌichu wo t‑ahgi.”
<sax> Jesus replied, “I AM—the one who is speaking to you.” ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “Dani ahni Jiosh si Kehsha.”
<sax> Just then the disciples returned. They were shocked that he was talking to a woman, but none of them asked “What are you doing?” or “Why are you talking with her?” ||| Kuchd edapk i dada. D am wabsh kia wehmaj neok hegai uwi. Kuchd si has i t‑elid k wabshaba pi has shaꞌi kaij.
<sax> The woman left her water jar behind and ran back to the town, telling the people, ||| D ihda uwi am wabsh i dagito g e‑haꞌa k gam hu si s‑hohtam uhpam hih kihhim wui k ash am ha ahgid k hab kaij,
<sax> “Come and meet a man who told me everything I ever did! Could this be the Messiah?” ||| “Oi g ab wo i hihim k wo nei hegai mo am wehs ni‑ahgid mani has i ni‑wua. Kutp hu d i Jiosh si Kehsha.”
<sax> So they went out of the town to go and see him. ||| Kudki ab ha hekaj i hihi g hemajkam s‑neidamk g Jesus.
<sax> “Did someone bring him food?” the disciples asked one another. ||| Chd hab kaij ab aꞌai t‑wui, “A nat ia heki hu hema gegos?”
<sax> Jesus told them, “My food is to do the will of the One who sent me, and to complete his work. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus ab t‑wui, “Ni‑gegosig o d ihda mant hab wo juh g Jiosh tatchui k wo nahto hegai chikpan mo ab ni‑mohtoꞌid.
<sax> Don't you have a saying, ‘four more months until harvest?’ Open your eyes and look around! The crops in the fields are ripe, ready for harvest. ||| Neh, bo e chechꞌe mat g ha‑esha wo i e baꞌiha mat d wo giꞌik i mashadk. Nt wabshaba wo em‑chehgi mat hemu si s‑hohtam wo e baꞌiha haꞌichu.
<sax> The reaper is being paid and harvesting a crop for eternal life so that both the sower and the reaper can celebrate. ||| Ahni ant am ei g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. Kumt ahpim wo ha baꞌiha hegam mat wo bei g pi ha huhugedam doakag. Kutt hekaj t‑wehm wo s‑hehgigk.
<sax> So the proverb ‘one sows, another reaps,’ is true. ||| Id o heg wepogidas hab cheꞌidag mo hab chuꞌig, ‘Hema oꞌodham at am wo haꞌichu ei. T d wabsh wo hemak ch am wo hih g esha.’
<sax> I sent you to reap what you didn't work for. Others did the hard work and you have reaped the benefits of what they did.” ||| Ab g wo neid hegam mo ab hihim. Pi amt ha ahgi g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga k wabshaba wo ha baꞌiha hegam mat wo e doꞌibia.”
<sax> Many Samaritans from that town trusted in him because of what the woman said: “He told me everything I ever did.” ||| Kud wa muꞌijj hegam kihkam ab i s‑wohoch mo g Jesus d Jiosh si Kehsha heg hekaj mo hab kaij hegai uwi, “Heg o wehs ni‑ahgid mani has i ni‑wua.”
<sax> So when they came to see him they pleaded with him to stay with them. He stayed for two days, ||| D heg hekaj ab si ahgid g Jesus am wui dadak mat wo si s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌid k am wo kia ha wehmajkahim heꞌekia tash. Kuchd wa woho am ha wehmajkahim gohk tash.
<sax> After the two days he continued on to Galilee. ||| Kuchd amjed gam hu hahawa haꞌab hihi Galilee chekshani wui
<sax> Jesus himself had made the comment that a prophet is not respected in his own country. ||| no pi hab kaij g Jesus, “No hu d wabsh i neida g Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam amai mo hebai d si kihj am jewed.”
<sax> But when he arrived in Galilee, the people welcomed him, because they had also been at the Passover feast and had seen everything he'd done in Jerusalem. ||| D wabshaba muꞌijj g hemajkam amai ab haꞌichugkahim Jerusalem t ab ch wuhshad g t‑shohshon ha‑doꞌibiadag ch am neid g Jesus. Kud wa am hab wua g s‑hasig haꞌichu. D idam si s‑hehgig ch ab neid g Jesus matt ged hu dada.
<sax> He visited Cana in Galilee again, where he had turned water into wine. Nearby in the town of Capernaum lived a royal official whose son was very sick.  When he heard that Jesus had returned from Judea to Galilee, he went to Jesus and begged him to come and heal his son who was close to death. ||| Kuchd oi wa gam hu haꞌab hihi Cana kihhim wui mat wa am si wehpeg hab juh g si s‑hasig haꞌichu mat wa wabsh g shuhdagi nawaitt.

<sax> “Unless you see signs and wonders you people really won't trust me,” said Jesus. ||| D hab wabsh kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Aha, namt pi hedai ab hu wo i s‑ni‑wohoch, mt hekid wo ipki nei mant hab wo juh g si s‑hasig haꞌichu?”
<sax> “Lord, just come before my child dies,” the official pleaded. ||| D am hab waꞌap kaij g s‑has haꞌichu, “Ab g si i s‑ni‑hoꞌigeꞌid k wo ni‑oi am ni‑kih wui mat koi wo muh g ni‑aliga.”
<sax> “Go on home,” Jesus told him. “Your son will live!” ||| D hab hahawa kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Gamai g s‑ap e tahtk hihm. T wo doa g m‑aliga.”
<sax> While he was on his way, his servants met him with the news that his son was alive and recovering. ||| Sh am himad ch ab haꞌi ha nam g e‑pionag mash si s‑hehgig ch hab kaij, “Tki wo doa g m‑aliga.”
<sax> This was the second miraculous sign Jesus did after coming from Judea to Galilee. ||| Neh, id o d i gokkokam s‑hasig haꞌichu mat hab juh g Jesus ia Galilee chekshani ch ed.
<sax> After this, there was a Jewish festival so Jesus went to Jerusalem. ||| D am hahawa hema i e aihi g t‑mihshmda piast. Kuchd hekaj gam hu hihi Jerusalem wui.
<sax> Now near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem is a pool called Bethzatha in Hebrew, with five porches beside it. ||| Am o hema woꞌog kihhim ch ed ch hab e aꞌaga Bethsada ch an miabidch hegai kolhai kihjeg mam an ha gagda g kahwal. K an hetasp wapttog heg wehgaj woꞌo.
<sax> Crowds of sick people were lying in these porches—those who were blind, lame, or paralyzed. ||| K idam ha wecho shaꞌi muꞌi nahnko mahs kokꞌodam an woꞌowop ch haꞌi d pi neneadam ch haꞌi d pi hihimidkam ch haꞌi ab wabsh i s‑momoik. [Kush idam nenida g shuhdagi matsh am wo i hoi

<sax> One man who was there had been sick for thirty-eight years. Jesus looked at him, knowing he had been lying there for long time, and asked him, ||| D am hema woꞌo g oꞌodham ch waikko wehst‑mahm gamai gigiꞌik (34) aꞌahid ab waꞌi mumku.
<sax> “Do you want to be healed?” ||| D g Jesus am neid ch s‑mahch mo tash am waꞌi woꞌo ch hab kaij ab wui, “Nap tatchua mapt wo doa?”
<sax> “Sir,” the sick man answered, “I don't have anyone to help me get into the pool when the water is stirred. While I'm trying to get there, someone always gets in before me.” ||| D hab kaij g mumkudam, “Ni‑nawoj, pi o an hu hedaig mas am wo i ni‑huduni shuhdagi ch ed mo hekid am i hoike. Ni im hu haha wabsh i ni‑nakog mant am wo i hud, k gam hu heki hu hema ni‑baꞌiwichchek.”
<sax> So the Jews said to the man who'd been healed, “This is the Sabbath! It's against the law to carry a mat!” ||| D haꞌi neid g t‑wehm oꞌodham ch hab ahg, “Neh, ahpi, melchkwua ap g t‑chehanig map kushwiotch g e‑wahkus. A nap pi mahch mo d mihshmda tash?”
<sax> “The man who healed me told me to pick up my mat and start walking,” he replied. ||| D hab hahawa kaij hegai mo wa mumkuhim, “Hegai mat ni‑doaj o hab ni‑ahg mant am wo bei g ni‑wahkus k wo hih.”
<sax> “Who's this person who told you to carry your mat and walk?” they asked. ||| D ab hahawa kakke mas hedai wud hegai mo hab ahg mat wo kushwiotk hih g e‑wahkus.
<sax> However the man who'd been healed didn't know who it was, for Jesus had slipped away into the surrounding crowd. ||| D wabshaba am wabsh i pi e amich nad pi g Jesus im hu pi e mahsid hemajkam ha shahgid no pi shaꞌi muꞌijj g hemajkam amai.
<sax> Later on Jesus found the man in the Temple, and told him, “Look, now you've been healed. So stop sinning or something worse may happen to you.” ||| D am hahawa g Jesus s‑neidam k am cheh geꞌe cheopi ch ed k hab ahg, “Neh, doa apt. Pi g am hu hab i ep junihim g pi apꞌekam nat pi haꞌichu baꞌich i pi ap hab wo e juh am m‑tahgio mapt am hab ep wo i junihi g pi apꞌekam.”
<sax> The man went and told the Jews it was Jesus who had healed him. ||| D am i wuhshani k gam hu him k am ha ahgi moki d Jesus mat doaj.
<sax> So the Jews started to harass Jesus because he was doing things on the Sabbath. ||| D am i s‑mai idam mash d Jesus mat hab juh ihda mihshmda tash ed k heg hekaj am i kudu ab neꞌowinch.
<sax> But Jesus told them, “My Father is still working, and so am I.” ||| D g Jesus hab kaij ab ha wui, “Ni‑ohg Jiosh o chum hekid g s‑apꞌekam chikpan. Ni ahni hab waꞌap chum hekid hab ni‑wua.”
<sax> For the Father loves the Son, and reveals to him everything he does; and the Father will show to him even more incredible things that will completely amaze you. ||| Ni‑ohg o ab si pihk ni‑elid ch am ni‑chehgid mant has wo chum juni. T ab wo ni‑mah g gewkdag mant baꞌich i geꞌe haꞌichu hab wo juh mo ihda. Mt ab wabsh wo i hahaꞌadka.
<sax> For just as the Father gives life to those he resurrects from the dead, in the same way the Son also gives life to those that he wants. ||| Ni‑ohg o i ha wuwhasid g koꞌi ab muhkig amjed ch ab ni‑mahkch g gewkdag mant s‑ap hab wo juh. Nt hekaj ab wo i ha wuwhas mani hedai hab i elid.
<sax> The Father judges no one. He has given to the Son all the authority to judge, ||| K g ni‑ohg pi hedai ha lodait ch wabshaba ahni ab ni‑mah hegai apꞌedag mant wo ha lodai
<sax> so that everyone may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. Anyone who doesn't honor the Son doesn't honor the Father who sent him. ||| no pi hab elid mat wehsijj ab wo si has i ni‑el hab masma mo ab si has i elid g ni‑ohg. Am at i ni‑kei g Jiosh. T hedai pi ab hu has wo ni‑elidad ch hab wa masma pi ab hu has elid g ni‑ohg.
<sax> I tell you the truth: those who follow what I say and trust the One who sent me have eternal life. They won't be condemned, but have gone from death to life. ||| “Do si wohokam ihda mant hab wo chei. T wo edagi g pi ha huhugedam doakag k am wo wehmajk g Jiosh hegam mat hedai ab wo kaihamad g haꞌichu ni‑ahga ch ab wo hiwgad g Jiosh. Pi ant ab hu wo ha mohtoꞌi g ha‑chuꞌijig mas hekaj gm hu hab wo i e juh ab amjed g Jiosh.
<sax> I tell you the truth: The time is coming—in fact it's here already—when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live! ||| Nt wo si shel em‑ahgi mo ab him g tash, pej heki hu e ai, mant ab wo i ha wai g koꞌi ahni Jiosh alidag. T hegam mat ab i kaiha g haꞌichu ni‑ahga ab wo i wuwha.
<sax> Just as the Father has life-giving power in himself, so has he given the Son the same life-giving power in himself. ||| Ni‑ohg o d hegai mo ab ha mahkch g doakag ch ab ni‑mahkch g gewkdag mant hab waꞌap wo ha mah g doakag.
<sax> The Father also granted the authority for judgment to him, for he is the Son of man. ||| T ab ni‑mah g gewkdag mant ahni hab wo juh g lodaita nani pi d si Kehshaj.
<sax> I can do nothing by myself. I judge based on what I'm told, and my decision is right, for I'm not doing my own will but the will of the One who sent me. ||| D hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Pi ant wo shaꞌi ni‑nako mant hejel haꞌichu hab wo juh k wabshaba am si ni‑ohg oidk hab masma wo ha lodai. K hekaj hab s‑apꞌe g ni‑lodaita.
<sax> If I were to make claims about myself, such claims wouldn't be valid; ||| “Pi amt wo mahchk manis am ahg g wohokam mantp wabsh hejel wo ni‑wohokamch.
<sax> but someone else gives evidence about me, and I know what he says about me is true. ||| K heg hekaj am wa ni‑wehhejed neok g ni‑ohg Jiosh. Kuni s‑mahch mo d wohokam mo am ahg ab ni‑amjed.
<sax> You asked John about me, and he told the truth, ||| “Neh, am amt wa haꞌi hihi heg wui John mo wa em‑pahl wapkonahim. K wa am em‑ahgid g wohokam.
<sax> but I don't need any human endorsement. I'm explaining this to you so you can be saved. ||| Id ani hab wabsh kaij mamt hekaj wo e doꞌibia nam pi ahpim heg tatchua mat g oꞌodham am wo i wohokamch haꞌichu mamt ab haha wo i s‑wohoch. Ni ahni hi heki hu s‑mahch mani hedai wud ch pi shaꞌi tatchua mas am hema wo ge i ni‑wohokamch.
<sax> John was like a brightly-burning light, and you were willing to enjoy his light for a while. ||| John o wa ahgachug g wohokam ch hekaj em‑tonlidch. Kumt wa haꞌijj ahpim heꞌes ab si s‑hohhoꞌi g haꞌichu ahgaj k an e hehemapaid wehgaj hab masma mat g huꞌul nahgi wo s‑hohhoꞌi g tonlig.
<sax> But the evidence I'm giving is greater than John's. For I am doing the work that the Father gave me to do, ||| “John o s‑ap ni‑wohokamchud. K wabshaba ahni ab ni‑mahkch g Jiosh mani g s‑hasig haꞌichu hab wua. K id baꞌich i s‑ap ni‑wohokamchud mani d ni‑ohg kehsha.
<sax> and this is the proof that the Father sent me. The Father who sent me, he himself speaks on my behalf. You've never heard his voice, and you've never seen what he looks like, ||| Pi am hekid neid g Jiosh. K pi hekid ab hu em‑wuhiosha neid ch neok ch wabshaba am ni‑wohokamchud mani d kehshaj.
<sax> And yet you don't want to come to me so that you might live. ||| mani ahni d em‑doꞌibiakam. M eda pi ab hu ni‑hiwig.
<sax> I'm not looking for human approval ||| “Neh, pi ani heg nenꞌoid mas g hemajkam ab wo si ni‑haꞌichuch. Jiosh at ab wo si ni‑haꞌichuch.
<sax> —I know you, and that you don't have God's love in you. ||| Kuni s‑em‑amichud ch s‑mahch mam pi ab hu shaꞌi tatchua g Jiosh.
<sax> For I've come to represent my Father, and you won't accept me; but if someone comes representing themselves, then you accept them! ||| Ia ant jiwia g ni‑ohg si wehhejed. Kum pi ab hu has ni‑elid. Hegam at ab has d wo em‑elidak matp hedam wabsh hejel e wehhejed ab wo i wuwha.
<sax> How can you trust in me when you look for praise from one another and yet you don't look for praise from the one true God? ||| Pi amt has masma ab hu wo s‑wohoch g Jiosh nam pi heg am waꞌi s‑nenꞌoid mamt ab aꞌai wo si has i e el. K eda d chum Jiosh mamt ab wo chum hehgchul.
<sax> But don't think I will be making accusations about you to the Father. It's Moses who is accusing you, the one in whom you place such confidence. ||| Ni wabshaba pi d ahni manis ab wo haꞌichu em‑abch am ni‑ohg wui. Mosesbad chehanig am ab hiwig. K d hegai mat am wo tashogi g pi ap em‑chuꞌijig.
<sax> For if you really trusted Moses you would trust in me, because he wrote about me. ||| Mosesbad at haꞌichu oꞌoha ab ni‑amjed. Kumt ab wo s‑ni‑wohoch mamt hems woho ab wo s‑wohochudad g Mosesbad oꞌohana.
<sax> But since you don't trust what he said, why would you trust what I say?” ||| Pi amt has masma ab hu wo s‑wohoch g ni‑ahga namki pi woho wohochud mat haschu an oꞌoha g Mosesbad.” Neh, bad kaij g Jesus am ha mihshmadch.
<sax> Jesus went up a hill and sat down there with his disciples. ||| D ab i chesh g Jesus kawulk t ab. Kuchd ahchim waꞌi mach ab si wecho t‑mashcham am i oid k am wehmaj dadhaiwua.
<sax> The time for the Jewish festival of the Passover was approaching. ||| D eda e aihim mat wo e wuhshad g t‑shohshon ha‑doꞌibiadag.
<sax> When Jesus looked up, and saw a large crowd coming towards him, he asked Philip, “Where can we buy enough bread to feed all these people?” ||| Kud muꞌi hegam mad gam hu wo piasto ab i hihi s‑kaimkch g Jesus.
<sax> He only asked this to see how Philip would respond, because Jesus already knew what he was going to do. ||| Bo kaij ch wabsh s‑aꞌappemamk g Philip no pi wa chum s‑mahch mat has masma hab wo juh.
<sax> “Two hundred silver coins wouldn't buy enough bread to give everyone even just a little,” Philip replied. ||| D hab kaij g Philip, “Pi att wo shaꞌi t‑nako. Chum achs hems gohk siant pihshkaj wo ui g pahn, t eda pi wo ha ai g haꞌakia hemajkam.”
<sax> One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up. ||| D hegai mo d Simon Peter nawoj ch hab chehgig Andrew hab kaij,
<sax> “There's a boy here who has five barley loaves and a couple of fish, but what good is that when there are so many people?” ||| “Ia o hema haꞌichug g ali ch hi wa hetasp sismito ch gohk waptopi uꞌa. T wabshaba pi haꞌichu ab hu wo shaꞌi ha nako haꞌakia hemajkam ha wehhejed”.
<sax> “Have everybody sit down,” Jesus said. There was plenty of grass there, so they all sat down, the men numbering around five thousand. ||| D ab hahawa t‑ahgid g Jesus matt wo ha cheha g hemajkam mat wo dadhaiwua no pi an s‑washaig. D am i wehsijj dadhaiwua g hemajkam k d hetasp mihl chechoj ch muꞌi ehp g uꞌuwi ch aꞌal.
<sax> So they collected and filled twelve baskets with the pieces of the five barley loaves the people had eaten. ||| Kuchd an i uꞌihim k gamai gohk wapshomi ha shuhshud heg hekaj wihpiꞌidag.
<sax> When the people saw this miracle, they said, “Surely this is the Prophet who was to come into the world.” ||| Neh, d am i nei g hemajkam mat si s‑hasig haꞌichu hab juh g Jesus k hab kaij, “Neh, mo d wabsh i si shel moki id d hegai Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam mach nenida matsh ia wo jiwia id dahm jewed.”
<sax> Jesus realized that they were about to force him to become their king, so he left them and went up into the hills to be by himself. ||| D g Jesus ha amich mat an wabsh wo si be k wo geꞌe kownalch k hekaj gam hu hejel baꞌich i chesh doꞌag t ab.
<sax> When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea, ||| Hudunihim o g tash. Kuchd gam hu i huhud
<sax> climbed into a boat, and headed across the water towards Capernaum. By now it was night and Jesus had not joined them yet. ||| k am chum i chehchsh g wahlkokaj Capernaum wui nad pi hab t‑ah g Jesus k hab kaij matsh pi oi gam hu wo hih. D am i s‑chuk.
<sax> A strong wind began blowing and the sea grew rough. ||| D g s‑gewk hewel ab i med k ab i kudu g shuhdagi.
<sax> When they had rowed three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea, coming towards the boat. They were very frightened. ||| Kuchd am himchud g wahlko am hu i giꞌik mihya. D ab haha wabsh hema him t‑wui an wabsh shuhdagi dahm. Kuchd hab i neidok si t‑totods.
<sax> “Don't be afraid!” he told them. “It's me.” ||| D ab hahawa t‑wui neo k oki d Jesus ch hab kaij, “Pi g am wo e totodsid. Ahni ani wud”.
<sax> Then other boats arrived from Tiberias, landing near to the place where they'd eaten the bread once the Lord had blessed it.  Once the crowd realized that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went over to Capernaum, looking for Jesus. ||| D idam an chum gagahim ch pi cheh g Jesus k nei matt pi am hu ep dada.

<sax> When they found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?” ||| K hekid am i chehg k hab kaij ab wui, “T‑mashchamdam, hekid apt ia i jiwia?”
<sax> “I tell you the truth,” Jesus replied, “you're looking for me because you ate as much bread as you wanted, not because you understood the miracles. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus, “Am ani woho ni‑chehgidch em‑wui heg hekaj s‑hasig haꞌichu mani hab wua.

<sax> Don't be preoccupied about food that doesn't last, but concentrate on the lasting food of eternal life which the Son of man will give you, for God the Father has placed his seal of approval on him.” ||| Pi g am wo si e kudutad wabsh g haꞌichu hugikaj ch wabshaba heg wo chum s‑behim mo d pi ha huhugedam.

<sax> So they asked him, “What do we have to do in order to do what God wants?” ||| D hab kaij g hemajkam, “Tt has wo t‑juh k ab wo bei g pi ha huhugedam doakag?”
<sax> Jesus replied, “What God wants you to do is to trust in the one he sent.” ||| D g Jesus hab ha ahg, “Ihda waꞌi mamt ab wo ni‑hiwgad ahni Jiosh si Kehsha.”

<sax> “Our forefathers ate manna in the desert in fulfillment of the Scripture that says, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’ ” ||| Neh, ab ash gegshshe dahm kahchim t amjed hegai haꞌichu hugi mash hab e aꞌaga ‘manna’.

<sax> “I am the bread of life,” Jesus replied. “Anyone who comes to me will never be hungry again, and anyone who trusts in me will never be thirsty again. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus, “Ahni ani wud mo g ni‑ohg ab em‑makiog.

<sax> For I came down from heaven not to do what I want, but to do what the One who sent me wants.  What he wants is for me not to lose anyone he has given to me, but for me to raise them up at the last day. What my Father wants is for everyone who sees the Son and trusts in him to have eternal life, and for me to raise them up at the last day.” ||| Do ni‑ohg tatchui mamt ab ni‑wui wo i e dagito ch hab wo edagi g pi ha huhugedam doakag.

<sax> Then the Jews began to grumble about him because he had said, “I am the bread that came down from heaven.” ||| D g hahaꞌichu si gahghai e mohmgid ch s‑babgam neneok
<sax> They said, “Isn't this Jesus, the son of Joseph? We know his father and his mother.

<sax> “Stop grumbling to each other,” Jesus said. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus, “Pi g am wo gahghai e mohmgid k s‑babgam neneok.
<sax> I tell you the truth: anyone who trusts in him has eternal life. ||| “Neh, hegam mat ab wo i s‑ni‑wohochud k wo ni‑bei at hekaj wo edagi g pi ha huhugedam doakag.

<sax> Then the Jews argued heatedly among themselves. “How can this man give us his flesh to eat?” they asked. ||| D id kaiok am si s‑babgam e neꞌowi g hahaꞌichu hab kaijch, “Pi at has shaꞌi masma wo t‑mah g e‑chuhkug machs wo huh.”
<sax> Jesus told them, “I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you cannot truly live. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus, “Pi amt wo edagi g pi ha huhugedam doakag pi ab hu ni‑bek ahni Jiosh si Kehsha.

<sax> Jesus explained this while he was teaching in a synagogue at Capernaum. ||| Neh, bad kaij g Jesus mad eda am ha mashcham g hemajkam ha‑cheopi ed amai Capernaum t am.
<sax> Many of his disciples when they heard it said, “This is hard to accept! Who can follow it?” ||| D muꞌijj hegam mo am t‑wehm oid g Jesus hab hahawa kaij, “Shoꞌoki waꞌi si s‑hasig ihda mashchamaj ch pi ab hu ta kaihama.”
<sax> Jesus saw that his disciples were complaining about this, so he asked them, “Are you offended by this? ||| D g Jesus wabsh ha amich mo has kaij an s‑juꞌujpij neneokch k hab kaij ab ha wui, “Pi amki hohhoꞌid g ni‑mashchama
<sax> Then what if you were to see the Son ascend to where he was before? ||| ch eda wo nei mant am uhpam ep wo hih dahm kahchim wui ahni Jiosh si kehsha.

<sax> Jesus added, “This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is made possible by the Father.” ||| D hab ep kaij, “Pi amt hedai wo e nako mams ab wo s‑ni‑wohochud k wo ni‑bei, heg hi wa mat g ni‑ohg am wo i chikp em‑eda.”
<sax> Simon Peter answered, “Lord, who would we follow? You're the one who has the words of eternal life. ||| D g Simon Peter hab kaij ab wui, “T‑kownalig, pi o an hu hedai ehp machs heg wui wo hihi. Ahpi ap waꞌi am ahgachug hegai matt hekaj wo bei g pi ha huhugedam doakag.

<sax> Jesus replied, “Didn't I choose you, the twelve disciples? Yet one of you is a devil.” ||| D hab kaij g Jesus, “Heuꞌu, woho o wa. Kunt am i em‑chuhcha ahpim gamai gohk mamt id an wo ahgachugad. M wabshaba hema d wabsh sha jiawul.”

<sax> After this, Jesus spent his time going from place to place in Galilee. He did not want to do so in Judea because the Jews were out to kill him. ||| Am amsh chum s‑muꞌamk g Jesus Judea chekshani ch ed. D hekaj pi am hu himimk. Kuchd an oiopo Galilee chekshani ch ed.
<sax> But as it was almost time for the Jewish festival of the Tabernacles, ||| D eda e aihim hegai piast mach ab ihm g Jiosh mo babhaijid g t‑eꞌes.
<sax> his brothers told him, “You ought to leave and go to Judea so your followers will be able to see what miracles you can do. ||| D heg hekaj hab kaij g Jesus wepnag ab wui, “Pt hems gm hu wo hih iꞌajed Judea wui. T wo nei g s‑hasig m‑chikpan hegam mo wa an m‑oidahim Judea ch ed.

<sax> After saying this he stayed behind in Galilee. ||| Neh, bad kaij ab ha wui ch am wabsh i wih Galilee ch ed.
<sax> After his brothers left to go to the festival, Jesus also went, but not openly—he stayed out of sight. ||| Heg i dahm mad gam hu hihi g Jesus wepnag, d am hahawa epai him k wabshaba wabsh s‑aꞌagi. Kuchd ahchim gam hu i oi.
<sax> Now at the festival the Jewish leaders were searching for him and kept on asking, “Where is he?” ||| Sh hegam mo d hahaꞌichu am Judea ch ed an gahg ch an kaiam mas hebai has chuꞌig.
<sax> Many people in the crowds were complaining about him. Some said, “He's a good man,” while others argued, “No! He deceives people.” ||| D eda an s‑juꞌujpij neneok g hemajkam ch hab kaij, “Do si s‑ap oꞌodham.”
<sax> But no one dared to speak openly about him because they were afraid of what the Jewish leaders would do to them. ||| K wabshaba s‑aꞌagi an aꞌaga no pi s‑ha ehbid g hahaꞌichu.
<sax> When the festival was halfway through Jesus went to the Temple and began to teach. ||| Kud eda hugkam waꞌi hih g piast. D am hih g Jesus geꞌe cheopi wui k am i ha mashcha.
<sax> The Jewish leaders were very surprised, and asked, “How does this man have so much learning when he hasn't been educated?” ||| D hegam hahaꞌichu si has i elid k hab kaij, “S has hig masma geꞌe haꞌichu s‑mahch ihda oꞌodham mat eda pi shaꞌi e mashcha g papal ha‑mashchama?”
<sax> Jesus answered, “My teaching is not from me but from the One who sent me. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Jiosh at ab ni‑cheha mant ia wo jiwia jewed dahm. K d Jiosh mashchamadag ihda mani i ha mashcham.
<sax> Moses gave you the law, didn't he? Yet none of you keeps the law! Why are you trying to kill me?” ||| Bam chum e wua mam am hab si junihim hegai chehanig mat wa g Jiosh ab mah g Moses am em‑wehhejed. M wabshaba pi woho hab junihim nam pi s‑ni‑muꞌamk.”
<sax> “You're demon-possessed!” the crowd replied. “No one's trying to kill you!” ||| D ab si neneok g hemajkam ch hab kaij, “P haschu ahgch hab kaij mam s‑m‑muꞌamk? Jiawul o an uꞌukch g m‑chegitoidag.”
<sax> “I did one miracle and you're all shocked by it,” Jesus replied. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Woho am s‑ni‑muꞌamk. Ha ant dodaj mihshmda tash ed. Kum heg hekaj s‑ni‑muꞌamk.
<sax> “However because Moses told you to circumcise—not that it really came from Moses, but from your forefathers before him—you perform circumcision on the Sabbath. ||| Neh, nt am wo em‑chehgi mam ahpim hab waꞌap wua g chikpan mihshmda tash ed.

<sax> Don't judge by appearances; decide what's right!” ||| Am g wo si i aꞌamichud mamt s‑ap wo s‑mahchk haꞌichu.”
<sax> Then some of those from Jerusalem began wondering, “Isn't this the one they're trying to kill? ||| D haꞌijj hab kaij g Jerusalem t am kihkam, “Aha no hig pi woho d ihda mam chum s‑muꞌamk.
<sax> But see how openly he's speaking, and they're saying nothing to him. Do you think the authorities believe he's the Messiah? ||| K eda haschu ahgch pi hedai has ahg? K ia t‑jehnigid. Aha no hab elid g hahaꞌichu mo wa woho d Jiosh si Kehsha?
<sax> So they tried to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him because his time had not yet come. ||| Kumd am hahawa chum bei. T wabshaba pi koi e ai g tashgaj. D pi e nako idam.
<sax> However many of the crowd did put their trust in him. “When the Messiah appears, will he do more miraculous signs than this man has done?” they said. ||| Kud muꞌi ab i s‑wohochud k wabsh s‑juꞌujpij hab kaij ab aꞌai e wui, “Naꞌas woho d Jiosh si Kehsha nat pi pi hedai wo shaꞌi e nako mas hab wo juh hegai hab mahs s‑hasig haꞌichu mo ihda hab wua.”
<sax> When the Pharisees heard the crowd whispering this about him, they and the chief priests sent guards to arrest Jesus. ||| D am haꞌi oiopo g Palasi ch am i kah hegai mo hab e kaij k am hihim k atsh am ha ahgi g uꞌugchu papal. Tsh hegam am ha cheha g geꞌe cheopi nuhkuddam mat an wo bei g Jesus.
<sax> Then Jesus told the people, “I'll be with you just a little longer, but then I'll return to the One who sent me. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus, “Pi ant shaꞌi tash ia hu wo em‑wehmajkahim ch gam hu hahawa uhpam wo hih heg wui mat ia i ni‑ahꞌad.
<sax> You'll search for me but you won't find me; and you can't come where I'm going.” ||| Kumt wo chum ni‑gahgad ch wabshaba pi wo ni‑edgid k pi wo e nako mams am wo hihi mant hebai wo haꞌichugk.”
<sax> The Jews said to each other, “Where could he be going that we couldn't find him? Is he planning to go to those scattered among the foreigners, and teach the foreigners? ||| D am wabsh i pi amich g hemajkam k hab kaij ab aꞌai e wui, “A t hebai wo hih, chs hab pi wo edagi?”
<sax> What does he mean by saying, ‘You'll search for me but you won't find me; and you can't come where I'm going’?” ||| A shahꞌo d ahga mo hab kaij matt wo chum gahgad ch wabshaba pi wo edgid k pi wo t‑nako machs am wo hihi mat hebai wo haꞌichugk.”
<sax> On the last and most important day of the festival, Jesus stood up and shouted out in a loud voice, “If you're thirsty, come to me and drink. ||| D am i e ai g si oidchkam tash mo baꞌiwechkim d si geꞌe tash heg eda piast.

<sax> When they heard these words, some of the people said, “This man is definitely the Prophet!” ||| D muꞌi hab kaij am i kaiok, “Ihda oꞌodham oki d wa woho hegai Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam mach nenida.”
<sax> Others said, “He is the Messiah!” Still others said, “How can the Messiah come from Galilee? ||| D hai hab ep kaij, “Doki Jiosh si Kehsha.”
<sax> Doesn't Scripture say that the Messiah comes from David's lineage, and from David's home town of Bethlehem?” ||| K eda an hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed matsh g Jiosh si Kehsha ab d wo t‑kownaligbad David amjedkamk ch ab wo amjedk g Bethlehem kihhim. Am ash d kihkam g Davidbad Bethlehem t am.”
<sax> So the crowd had a strong difference of opinion about him. ||| D heg hekaj ab aꞌai e wui gegokiwua g hemajkam.
<sax> Some wanted to arrest him, but nobody laid a hand on him. ||| Haꞌijj o chum s‑kuhpamk. D wabshaba pi hedai shaꞌi e nako mas hab juh.
<sax> Then the guards returned to the chief priests and the Pharisees who asked them, “Why didn't you bring him in?” ||| D am uhpam hihi g geꞌe cheopi nuhkuddam am ha wui g uꞌugchu papal ch Palasi. D idam ab ha kakke ch hab kaij, “Shahchu amt ahgk pi an hu bei?”
<sax> “Nobody ever spoke like this man does,” the guards replied. ||| D hab kaij g geꞌe cheopi nuhkuddam, “Pi o hekid hedai hab shaꞌi kaidam neok mo ihda.”
<sax> “Have you been fooled too?” the Pharisees asked them. ||| D hab kaij hegam Palasi ab ha wui, “Aha nat hab waꞌap em‑iattogi?
<sax> Nicodemus, who had previously gone to meet Jesus, was one of them and asked them, ||| D am ha wehmaj hegai mat wa am hu hebai chuhug ch ed am i chehgim g Jesus k hab chehgig Nicodemas. Id o hab waꞌap d Palasi ch hab kaij ab ha wui,

<sax> Then they all went home, ||| D amjed gam hu aꞌai himto g hemajkam.
<sax> but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives. ||| Kuchd ahchim gam hu hihim k an kohksh Olive Uꞌus Kawulk t an.
<sax> Early in the morning he returned to the Temple where many people gathered around him and he sat down and taught them. ||| D ab i chesh g tash. Kuchd ged hu uhpam dada geꞌe cheopi wui. D muꞌi am e chehm g hemajkam Jesus wui k gan hu biha. D am dahiwua k ha mashcha.
<sax> The religious teachers and the Pharisees brought in a woman caught committing adultery and made her stand before everyone. ||| D ab wui haꞌi dada g chehanig ha mashchamdam ch Palasi am hema uꞌapadch g uwi. Id atsh ha ehs g ha‑kun. Kud am t‑shahgid i kehsh
<sax> They said to Jesus, “Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery. ||| K hab kaij ab wui g Jesus, “Neh, ahpi map ia ha mashcham, ihda uwi att s‑ap cheh mat ha ehs g ha‑kun.
<sax> They kept on demanding an answer, so he stood up and told them, “Whichever one of you has never sinned may throw the first stone at her.” ||| D oi wa idam pi dagito k ab ep kakke.
<sax> Then he bent down again and went on writing on the ground. ||| Bo kaij ch am hahawa i e jumalkad k am ep oꞌoha jewedo.
<sax> When they heard this they began to leave, one by one, starting with the oldest until Jesus was left in the middle of the crowd with the woman still standing there. ||| D am i kah ihda g chehanig ha mashchamdam ch Palasi k wabsh sha hehemako gam hu aꞌai hihi si e elidch. D hegam mo d geꞌeged wehpegat k wehsijj himto. K heg am waꞌi wih uwi Jesus wehm.
<sax> Jesus straightened up and asked her, “Where are they? Didn't anybody stay to condemn you?” ||| D ab i e shel g Jesus k ab wui hab kaij, “Baht hihi hegam mo ab haꞌichu m‑abchud? Nat pi ia hu hema wih mat ab wo m‑maꞌihi?”
<sax> “No one did, sir,” she replied. ||| D hab kaij g uwi, “Pi at ia hu hema wih, ni‑kownalig.”
<sax> Jesus spoke again to the people, telling them, “I am the light of the world. If you follow me you won't walk in darkness for you will have the life-giving light.” ||| D hab ep kaij g Jesus ab ha wui g hemajkam, “Dani geꞌe tonlig am wehs ha wehhejed g hemajkam.

<sax> “Even if I am my own witness, my testimony is true,” Jesus told them, “for I know where I came from and where I'm going. But you don't know where I came from or where I'm going. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus, “Pi ani em‑iattogid chum anis am hi wa hejel ni‑wohokamchud. Do wohokam mani has i kaij.

<sax> “Where is your father?” they asked him. ||| D ab kakke idam, “A k hebai has chuꞌig g m‑ohg?”
<sax> Jesus explained this while he was teaching near the Temple treasury. Yet no one arrested him because his time had not yet come. ||| Neh, id ad wehs hab kaij g Jesus am geꞌe cheopi t am heg eda kih mo g hemajkam am shulig g e‑mahkigdag g geꞌe cheopi wehhejed.

<sax> Jesus told them again, “I'm leaving, and you'll search for me, but you'll die in your sin. You can't come where I'm going.” ||| D hab ep kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Am ant hu wo hih. Kumt an haha wo i chum ni‑gahghim k wabshaba wo koi pi e doꞌibiak. Pi amt wo e nako mamt am wo hihi mant hebai wo i hih.”
<sax> The Jews wondered out loud, “Is he going to kill himself? Is that what he means when he says ‘You can't come where I'm going’?” ||| D heg hekaj hab kaij hegam hahaꞌichu, “Shahꞌo ahgch hab kaij matt pi wo t‑nako matt am wo hihi mat hebai wo i hih. Aha nat wabsh hejel wo e mua.”

<sax> That is why I told you that you'll die in your sins. For if you don't trust in me, the ‘I am,’ you'll die in your sins.” ||| Kum eda pi ni‑wohochud mani d ge ahni. Ni heg hekaj am em‑ahgid mamt wo koi pi e doꞌibiak.”
<sax> They didn't understand that he was talking to them about the Father. So Jesus explained to them: ||| D idam pi amichud mo g Jiosh hab ahg.
<sax> “When you have lifted up the Son of man then you'll know that I am the ‘I am,’ and that I do nothing of myself, but only say what the Father taught me. ||| D heg hekaj hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Mt wo mai mani d ge ahni mamt hekid ab uhgk wo ni‑ul mamt wo ni‑mua ahni Jiosh si Kehsha.

<sax> Your father is the Devil, and you love to follow your father's evil desires. He was a murderer from the beginning. He never stood for the truth, because there is no truth in him.

<sax> While I'm here in the world I am the light of the world.” ||| Dani tonlig am em‑wehhejed mani ia em‑wehmaj.”
<sax> His neighbors and those who had known him as a beggar, asked, “Isn't this the man who used to sit and beg?” ||| Hegam mo s‑mahch ch hegam mo si neid mo wabsh haꞌichu ha tahni ad am i neidok hab kaij, “Aha no pi woho d hegai mo am dahiwup ch haꞌichu ha tahni?”

<sax> “So how is it you can see?” they asked him. ||| Kumd ab ep kakke, “Shahpt masma nent?”
<sax> He replied, “A man called Jesus made some mud and put it on my eyes and told me, ‘Go and wash yourself in the Pool of Siloam.’ So I went and washed, and now I can see.” ||| D hab kaij, “Hegai mash d Jesus at ab bidsh g ni‑wuhpui am jewedo siswuak k hab ni‑ahg mant wo him k wo wako g ni‑wuhiosha am Siloam woꞌo ch ed.

<sax> “Where is he?” they asked. ||| D hab kaij idam, “T hebai hih?”
<sax> They took the man who had been blind to the Pharisees. ||| D am wa haꞌi bei ihda oꞌodham mo wa pi nea am Palasi ha wui.
<sax> Now it was the Sabbath when Jesus had made the mud and opened the blind man's eyes. ||| K d t‑mihshmda tash mad eda g Jesus hab juh ihda.
<sax> So the Pharisees also asked him how he could see. He told them, “He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and now I can see.” ||| D g Palasi ab hahawa kakke mas has masma nent.
<sax> The Jewish leaders still refused to believe that the man who had been blind could now see until they had called in the man's parents. ||| D wabshaba pi wohochud idam hahaꞌichu mas wa woho d pi neadam ch am ha waid g geꞌegedgaj
<sax> They asked them, “Is this your son whom you say was born blind? So how is it that now he can see?” ||| ch muꞌi haꞌichu ha kakke mas d ha‑aliga ihda ch ga hu i e‑mahsidag amjed pi nea, kch ehp mas has masma hahawa haꞌichu neid.
<sax> His parents answered, “We know this is our son who was born blind. ||| D hab hahawa kaij g geꞌegedgaj mo d ha‑aliga ch ga hu e‑mahsidag amjed pi nea
<sax> But we've no idea how he can see now, or who healed him. Why don't you ask him, he's old enough. He can speak for himself.” ||| ch wabshaba pi mahch mas has masma s‑ap haꞌichu neid ch ep pi mahch mas hedai doaj ch ab ha ahgid mat wo kakke no pi d geꞌe k ch hejel am wo e ah.
<sax> The reason his parents said this was because they were afraid of what the Jewish leaders would do. The Jewish leaders had already announced that anyone who declared that Jesus was the Messiah would be thrown out of the synagogue.  That was why his parents said, “Ask him, he's old enough.” ||| Hegam hahaꞌichu ad wa am heki hu apꞌech mat pi wo ha hiwigi mat am hu ep wo i wahp cheopi ch ed hegam mat hedam hab wo chei mo g Jesus d Jiosh si Kehsha.

<sax> Then they asked him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?” ||| D idam ab hahawa ep kakke, “T has m‑juh k m‑nench?”
<sax> We're disciples of Moses. We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this person, we don't even know where he comes from.” ||| S‑mahch ach mo g Jiosh g Mosesbad ab haꞌichu ahgid. Kuch pi shaꞌi mahch mas hebai amjed him hegai.”
<sax> The man answered, “That's incredible! You don't know where he comes from but he opened my eyes. ||| D hab kaij ihda, “M haschu ahgch pi mahch mas hebai amjed him. T eda ab i ni‑nench.
<sax> We know that God doesn't listen to sinners, but he does listen to anyone who worships him and does what he wants. ||| S‑mahch ach mo g Jiosh pi ab hu kaiham g pi ap chuꞌijkam ch wabshaba ab ha kaiham hegam mo ab si has elid ch am hab junihim g tatchuij.
<sax> Never before in the whole of history has anyone heard of a man born blind being healed. ||| Pi ach hekid shaꞌi kah mas hedai i nench hegai mo e‑mahsidag amjed pi nea.

<sax> “You were born totally sinful, and yet you're trying to lecture us,” they replied. And they threw him out of the synagogue. ||| D ab si s‑koꞌokam has ahg ch hab kaij, “Dap wabsh si hekia pi apꞌekam ga huꞌi e‑mahsidag amjed ch eda chum haꞌichu t‑mashcham.” D amjed gam hu si i wuhshad cheopi t amjed k pi hiwigi mas am ep wo i wah.
<sax> When Jesus heard that they had thrown him out, he went and found the man, and asked him, “Do you trust in the Son of man?” ||| D kah g Jesus mamt i wuhshad k am i gahghim k hab kaij am i chehgiok, “Nap ab si hiwig g Jiosh si Kehsha?”
<sax> The man replied, “Tell me who he is, sir, so I can put my trust in him.” ||| D hab kaij ihda oꞌodham, “A k hedai wud. Am g ni‑ahgid. Nt ab wo si i hiw.”
<sax> Then Jesus told him, “I've come into the world to bring judgment so that those who are blind may see, and those who see will become blind.” ||| D hab hahawa kaij g Jesus, “Ia ant jiwia jewed dahm mant wo mahsko wua mo hedai pi nea ch hedai s‑nea id eda Jiosh apꞌedag.”
<sax> Some Pharisees who were there with Jesus asked him, “We're not blind too, are we?” ||| D haꞌi am gegok g Palasi ch si has i elid k hab kaij, “Nap ahchim hab ep chum t‑ahg mach hab waꞌap pi nenea.”
<sax> Jesus answered, “If you were blind, you wouldn't be guilty. But now that you say you see, your guilt remains.” ||| D hab kaij g Jesus, “Pi amt ab hu wo em‑abch mamtp wo wohokamch mam pi nenea am Jiosh apꞌedag ed. M wabshaba hab chum kaij mam s‑nenea.”
<sax> “I tell you the truth, anyone who doesn't come in through the gate of the sheepfold but climbs in some other way is a thief and a robber. ||| D hab ep kaij g Jesus, “No hig pi woho mat g s‑chu ehskam wabsh s‑aꞌagi haskojed ab wo i wah heg eda kolhai mam am ha nuhkud g kahwal k wo s‑ha ehsidam?

<sax> The man paid to look after the sheep is not the shepherd and he runs away when he sees the wolf coming. He abandons the sheep because they're not his, and the wolf attacks and scatters the flock ||| Hegai mo d wabsh ha‑pionag at am wabsh wo i ha dagito k wo meh mat am wo jiwia g shehꞌe.

<sax> When she had said this, she went and told her sister Mary in private, “The Teacher's here, and asking to see you.” ||| Kud gam hu hahawa uhpam hih g Marda k atsh am wabsh s-aꞌagi wai g Mary ash hab kaijch mo ab him g ha mashchamdam ch ab waid.
<sax> When Mary arrived at the place where Jesus was and saw him, she fell at his feet and said, “Lord, if you'd been here, my brother wouldn't have died.” ||| D am i cheh g Mary g Jesus k ab i gei wecho k hab kaij, “Ni-kownalig, mapt hems s-hohtam wo jiwia, t chum pi wo muh g t-wehnag.”
<sax> When Jesus saw her crying, and the Jews who had come with her crying as well, he was very troubled and upset. ||| D am i nei g Jesus mo shoak g Mary. D hegam ep shoani mo wehmaj. D ged hu si ai g ihbdaj. D si has e tahtk
<sax> “Where have you laid him?” he asked. ||| k ab ha kakke mas hebai ehsto g chuhkugaj.
<sax> Then Jesus cried too. ||| D am i shosha g Jesus.
<sax> “See how much he loved him,” the Jews said. ||| D heg hekaj hab kaij g hemajkam, “Neh, kuki ab si pihk e elid wui.”
<sax> But some of them said, “If he could open the eyes of a blind man, couldn't he have kept Lazarus from dying?” ||| D wabshaba haꞌijj hab ep kaij, “Neh, t wa g pi neadam doaj. T haschu ahgk pi doaj g Lazarus mat pi wo muh?”
<sax> Very troubled, Jesus went to the tomb. It was a cave with a large stone placed at the entrance. ||| D am ep si has i e taht g Jesus k am i miabi g hihaꞌini. Id o ab cheho ch ed hab chuꞌig ch g hodaikaj ab kuhpi.
<sax> “Remove the stone,” Jesus told them. ||| D hab ha ahg g Jesus mat gam hu wo i nuꞌichkwua g hodai.
<sax> I know you always listen to me. I said this because of the crowd standing here so that they will believe that you sent me.” ||| S-mahch ani map chum hekid ab ni-kaiham ch wabshaba hab kaij ihda idam ha wehhejed hemajkam. T hab wo s-wohoch mapt ahpi ia i ni-ahꞌad,”
<sax> After saying this, Jesus shouted, “Lazarus, come out!” ||| k am i haꞌasa e hoꞌigeꞌidahun k am hahawa si s-kaidam neok ch hab kaij, “Lazarus, ab g i wuhshani!”
<sax> The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with strips of linen, and with a cloth around his face. ||| D ab i wuhsh g Lazarus k an wabsh kia bihiwigs g iꞌikuskaj mach hekaj ha bihiwig g t-koꞌi ch ab wabsh kia maꞌishp g wuhioshaj g ikuskaj. D hab ha ahg g Jesus, “Gam g hu wo padch g iꞌikus k wo hiwigi mat wo hih uhpam.” Neh, d wa woho hab e juh.
<sax> Consequently many of the Jews who had come to comfort Mary and who saw what Jesus did put their trust in him. ||| Muꞌijj hegam mad am i ha chehgio g Marda ch Mary ad ab i s‑wohoch mo g Jesus d Jiosh si Kehsha am i neidok mad haschu hab juh.
<sax> But others went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done. ||| Tki wabshaba haꞌi ehp gam hu hihi Palasi ha wui k am ha ahgi mat haschu hab juh.
<sax> Then the chief priests and the Pharisees called a meeting of the ruling council. “What shall we do?” they asked. “This man is doing many miracles. ||| Kutsh am e nam g Palasi ch uꞌugchu papal ha wehm g geꞌe e jehnigiddam k am aꞌaga mas has wo juh ihda s‑hasig haꞌichu hab wuadam.
<sax> If we allow him to continue, everybody will believe in him, and then the Romans will destroy both the Temple and our status as a nation.” ||| “Wehsijj at ab wo i s‑wohoch mo d Jiosh si Kehsha mattp am wabsh wo neidad.

<sax> “You don't understand anything!” said Caiaphas, who was high priest that year. ||| Sh am haꞌichug hegai mad d si uhgchu pahl ch hab chehgig Caiaphas ch si s‑gewkam hab ha ahg, “Kaij, ahpim am shaꞌi pi haꞌichu aꞌamichud

<sax> From that time on they plotted how they might kill Jesus. ||| Neh, iaꞌi amjed ad g hahaꞌichu am i e nako mat wo mua g Jesus.
<sax> So Jesus did not travel openly among the Jews but went to a town called Ephraim in the region near the desert and stayed there with his disciples. ||| D heg hekaj hahawa pi an hu s‑masma oimmed g Jesus Judea chekshani ch ed am i dagitok g Bethany. Chd gam hu hihim k am haꞌichugkahim mo am d Ephraim kihhim mo am miabidch g tohono jewed.
<sax> It was nearly time for the Jewish Passover, and many people went from the countryside to Jerusalem to purify themselves for the Passover. ||| Kud eda e aihim mat wo e wuhshad g t‑shohshon ha‑doꞌibiadag. K muꞌijj am hihim gam hu aꞌaijed Jerusalem kihhim wui mat am wo i e nako heg wehhejed.
<sax> People were looking for Jesus and talking about him as they stood in the Temple. “What do you think?” they asked each other. “Isn't he coming to the festival?” ||| D chum hedai an chum neid g Jesus am i e hemapadk geꞌe cheopi t am ch hab kaij ab aꞌai e wui, “Pi atp hems ia hu wo shaꞌi jiwia. Shahm i elid.”
<sax> The chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that anyone who knew where Jesus was should report it so they could arrest him. ||| Kuki eda g uꞌugchu papal ch Palasi am i ha chehani g hemajkam mat hemho wa wo ha ahgi sha s‑mahchk mo hebai haꞌichug g Jesus. T an wo bei.
<sax> Six days before the Passover Jesus went to Bethany, to the home of Lazarus who had been raised from the dead. ||| Chuhdp tash o wa am wiꞌis mat wo e ai g t‑shohshon ha‑doꞌibiadag wuhshda.
<sax> There a dinner was arranged in his honor. Martha helped serve the food while Lazarus sat at the table with Jesus and the others guests. ||| Kud wa am hab e juh g geꞌe gegosig Bethany t am wehhejed g Jesus. Kuchd gam hu hihim k am ha wehm t‑gegosid. D g Lazarus am ep t‑wehmaj. Marda ad am ha wehmaj hegam mad am hihidod ch an t‑toꞌid.
<sax> “Why wasn't this perfume sold and the money given to the poor? It was worth three hundred denarii.” ||| “T haschu ahgk pi e gagda ihda uhw shuhdagi matt wo ha mah g shoꞌigkam, natt pi ahim g waik siant pihsh namkigdag ab wo i nei g lial heg amjed.”
<sax> He wasn't saying this because he cared about the poor but because he was a thief. He was the one who looked after the disciples' money and he often took some for himself. ||| D eda pi woho s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌid g shoꞌigkam ch wabshaba s‑behimk g lial nadki pi s‑chu ehsk ch chum nuhkud g t‑lialiga ch wabsh hejel hekaj.
<sax> “Don't criticize her,” Jesus replied. “She did this in preparation for the day of my burial. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Dagitoni. T‑himdag oidk at hab juh g ni‑muhkig wehhejed.
<sax> You'll always have the poor here with you, but you won't always have me here.” ||| Chum o hekid ia em‑shahgid g shoꞌigkam. Nt wabshaba ahni hi pi wabsh chum hekid ia wo em‑shahgidk.”
<sax> A large crowd had found out that he was there. They came there not just to see Jesus but because they wanted to see Lazarus, the man Jesus had raised from the dead. ||| D eda wehsko kaidag mad g Jesus ab i wuhshad g Lazarus muhkig amjed. Kud muꞌi am dada g Judea t am hemajkam s‑ha neidamk.
<sax> So the chief priests planned to kill Lazarus as well,  since it was because of him that many Jews were no longer following them but putting their trust in Jesus. ||| Kud muꞌijj ab i s‑wohoch mo g Jesus d Jiosh si Kehsha k am i ha dagito g e‑wanimeddam am i neidok g Lazarus. D am i s‑mai g uꞌugchu papal k am i e nako mat g Lazarus hab waꞌap wo mua.
<sax> The following day the crowds of people who had come for the Passover festival heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. ||| D am baꞌich i mahsi.

<sax> They cut off palm branches and went to welcome him, shouting, “Hosanna! Blessed is the one coming in the name of the Lord. Blessed is the king of Israel.” ||| Idam ad ha uhꞌukch g chukud shosha uꞌus iꞌibhonig ch ab si has elid g Jesus si s‑kaidam hab kaijch, “Id o d s‑apꞌekam t‑kownalig ch ia jiwia am wehhejed g Jiosh. K g Jiosh si s‑hoꞌigeꞌid.”
<sax> At the time, Jesus' disciples did not understand what these things meant. It was only later when he was glorified that they realized what had happened had been prophesied and applied to him. ||| Kuchd pi shaꞌi amichud wehs ihda. Kut wa wabshaba hekid ab uhgk i e bei g Jesus dahm kahchim wui, tt am hahawa i chegito mo an oꞌohanas ihda Jiosh oꞌohana ed. Kutki heg hekaj hab e juh am wehhejed.
<sax> Many in the crowd had seen Jesus call Lazarus from the tomb and raise him from the dead and were telling the story.  That was the reason so many people went to meet Jesus—because they had heard about this miracle. ||| Idam muꞌi hemajkam ad wa am nam g Jesus nash pi kah mat ab i wuhshad g Lazarus muhkig amjed. Hegam mo wa am neid ash am ha ahgid.
<sax> The Pharisees said to one other, “Look, we're getting nowhere. Everyone's running after him.” ||| D hab kaij g Palasi ab aꞌai e wui am i ha neidok, “Ha g wo neid matki wehsijj am i oi. Pi attki wo t‑nako matt wo keshwua.”
<sax> Now some Greeks had come to the festival to worship. ||| D am haꞌi dada g Greek hemajkam Jerusalem t am mat ab wo has el g Jiosh heg eda doꞌibiadag wuhshda piast.
<sax> They came to Philip of Bethsaida in Galilee, and said, “Sir, we'd like to see Jesus.” ||| Kuchd am oiopo. D idam am dada k am cheh g Philip k am ahgi mo s‑neidamk g Jesus.
<sax> Philip went and told Andrew. Then they both went to Jesus and told him. ||| D g Philip am ahgi g Andrew. (Idam ad am d chum kihkam Bethsaida t am am Galilee chekshani ch ed.) Kud am hahawa e wehm hihim k am ahgi g Jesus.
<sax> Jesus replied, “The time has come for the Son of man to be glorified. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Idani at e ai g ni‑tashga mat g ni‑ohg wo ni‑maskogi mani d si Kehshaj.
<sax> I tell you the truth: unless a grain of wheat is planted in the soil and dies  it remains just one grain. But if it dies, it produces many more grains of wheat. ||| T wabshaba wehpeg haꞌichu hab wo e juh am ni‑tahgio. Neh, nat hig am wo i wuhshani k ab wo muꞌida g pilkani pi am hu e eshk?

<sax> Now I am troubled. What should I say? ‘Father, save me from this coming time of suffering? ’ No, for this is why I came—to go through this time of suffering. ||| D hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Ni‑ihbdag at ab si i e kudu. Ni hab chum ni‑tahtk mant hab wo chei, ‘Ni‑ohg, pi g hiwgid mas hab wo e juh ihda am ni‑tahgio.’ Nt eda heg hekaj ia jiwia mant am wo gahi wuhsh hegai s‑koꞌok haꞌichu.
<sax> Father, show the glory of your character.” ||| Pegih, ni‑ohg, am g maskogid g e‑gewkdag am gahi ni‑wuhshanim.”
<sax> The crowd that was standing there heard it. Some said it thundered; others said an angel had spoken to him. ||| Muꞌi o wa am gegok g hemajkam ch kah hegai mo ab neok. Haꞌijj o hab kaij, “Ab o kaidaghim g tataniki.”
<sax> Jesus told them, “This voice spoke not for my sake, but for yours. ||| D Wabshaba hab kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Ahpim at em‑wehhejed ab s‑kaidam neo, ch pi ahni ni‑wehhejed.
<sax> Now is the judgment of this world; now the prince of this world will be thrown out. ||| E at ai mat geꞌe wo bei g chuꞌijig g hemajkam. Jijawul ha‑geꞌejig o chum e kownalchud id dahm jewed. Nt wabshaba oi wo gewito.
<sax> But when I am lifted up from the earth I will attract everyone to me.” ||| Ab amt wo ni‑naggia uhs t ab ahni Jiosh si Kehsha. Kunt ab haha wo i ha wanchshul g hemajkam ni‑wui.”
<sax> (He said this to point out the kind of death he was going to die). ||| Neh, bo wa kaij g Jesus ch oki heg hab ahg mat has masma wo muh.
<sax> The crowd responded, “The Law tells us that the Messiah will live forever, so how can you say the Son of man must be ‘lifted up’? Who is this ‘Son of man’?” ||| D hab kaij g hemajkam, “An o hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed mat g Jiosh si Kehsha pi hekid wo muh. P haschu ahgch hab kaij mapt ab wo e naggia uhs t ab maptp woho d Jiosh si Kehsha?”
<sax> But despite all the miracles he had done in their presence, they still did not trust in Jesus. ||| Muꞌikko ad wa hab juh g s‑hasig haꞌichu g Jesus am ha‑nena ed idam hemajkam. Kud wabshaba muꞌijj pi ab hu wohochud mo d Jiosh si Kehsha.
<sax> This fulfilled the message of Isaiah the prophet who said, “Lord, who has believed what we told them? To whom has the Lord's power been revealed?” ||| Neh, d hab wa masma hab e juh hegai matki g kelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam Isaiah an oꞌoha. An o hab chuꞌig:
<sax> Even so many of the leaders did trust in him. However, they did not openly admit it because they did not want the Pharisees to expel them from the synagogue, ||| Kud muꞌi ab hi wa chum s‑wohoch g hahaꞌichu. Tsh wabshaba g Palasi gam hu wo i ha wuwhas matp wo s‑mai mat ab s‑wohoch. D heg hekaj pi am hu tasho e ahg
<sax> loving human admiration more than God's approval. ||| no pi s‑hohhoꞌid g ab has ha‑elida g hemajkam ch g Jiosh ab has elida wabsh pi ab hu haꞌichuchud.
<sax> Jesus called out, “If you trust in me you're not just trusting in me but also in the One who sent me. ||| Jesus ad am ep ha jehnigid ch si s‑kaidam hab kaij, “Matp hedai ab wo i s‑ni‑wohochud k hab waꞌap s‑wohochud g ni‑ohg Jiosh.

<sax> I know that what he told me to say brings eternal life—so whatever I say is what the Father told me.” ||| Kumt heg hekaj ab wo kaiham k hab wo bei g pi ha huhugedam doakag. Heg ani waꞌi hab kaij mo g Jiosh ab ni‑chehani.” Neh, bad kaij g Jesus.
<sax> It was the day before the Passover festival, and Jesus knew that the time had come to leave this world and go to his Father. He had loved those in the world who were his own, and he now demonstrated his complete and utter love for them. ||| D am him k am i e ai matt baꞌich tash wo mua g kahwal mad k wo wuhshad g t‑shohshon ha‑doꞌibiadag.

<sax> It was during supper, and the devil had already put the thought of betraying Jesus into the mind of Judas, son of Simon Iscariot. ||| D am e apꞌech matt am wo t‑gegos hema kih am gam hu i juhk. D wa eda heki hu ab i kaiha g Judas Iscariot g ge Jiawul k am i e shelch mat wo gagda g Jesus.
<sax> Jesus knew that the Father had placed everything under his authority, and that he had come from God and was going back to God. ||| Ab atsh Jiosh amjed ia jiwia g Jesus k ab wui ep wo i e nodagi. Kush g Jiosh ab wehs mahkch g gewkdag. D id s‑mahch g Jesus
<sax> So Jesus stood up from eating supper, took off his robe and wrapped a towel around his waist. ||| ch wabshaba am i kekiwua k am wuahawua g e‑lihwa k g tuayakaj ab e bahshodad
<sax> He poured water into a basin and began to wash his disciples' feet, drying them with the towel he had wrapped around him. ||| k am ge was wakonakud ch ed k ab i wapkonahi g t‑tahtad k heg hekaj ha dagio tuaya mat ab e bahshodad.
<sax> He came to Simon Peter, who asked him, “Lord, are you going to wash my feet?” ||| D ab i ai g Simon Peter. D heg si has e tahtk ch hab kaij, “Ih, napt wo wapko g ni‑tahtad k eda d ge ni‑kownalig!”
<sax> Jesus replied, “You won't realize what I'm doing for you now. But one day you'll understand.” ||| D hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Pi ap hi wa amichud hemuch mani haschu chum em‑tashogid id hekaj ch wabshaba wo wa amich imhab i baꞌich.”
<sax> Jesus responded, “Those who have had a bath only need to wash their feet and then they're clean all over. You are clean—but not all of you.”  For he knew who was going to betray him. That's why he said, “Not all of you are clean.” ||| D hab kaij g Jesus, “Heki apt hu e wako wehsko koi jiwiak. Heg at waꞌi e‑tahtad wo wapko hegai mat hedai heki hu wehsko e wako mat koi am hu wo jiwia kih t am.

<sax> After Jesus had washed their feet, he put his robe back on, and sat down. “Do you understand what I've done to you?” he asked them. ||| T am i ha wapko g ha‑tahtad k ab uhpam wah g e‑lihwa k ga hu hahawa ep dahiwua mihsa wui k ab ha kakke, “Nam s‑amichud mant haschu ahgk hab em‑juni ihda?

<sax> So if I, your Teacher and Lord, washed your feet, you ought to wash one another's feet. ||| Dani wa chum em‑kownalig ch d em‑mashchamdam ch eda am i ni‑jumalkad k heg ni‑wepogi mani d wabsh em‑pionag. Pegih, mt ahpim hab wa masma ab aꞌai wo e neidad

<sax> I'm not talking about all of you—I know those I have chosen. But this is to fulfill Scripture: ‘The one who shares my food has turned against me.’ ||| “Mt wabshaba pi wehsijj ab hu wo bei ihda no pi an hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed mamt hema ab ni‑wui wo kekiwua ahpim mam ni‑wehm e gegosid.

<sax> After he had said this, Jesus was deeply troubled, and declared: “I tell you the truth, one of you is going to betray me.” ||| D am hahawa si e kudu g Jesus k hab t‑ahg, “Pi ant ap ni‑taht k wo em‑ahgi mamt hema ahpim wo ni‑gagda.”
<sax> The disciples looked at each other, wondering which of them Jesus was talking about. ||| Kuchd si has i t‑taht k ab wabsh aꞌai si t‑neid pi shaꞌi amichudch mas hedai hab ahg.
<sax> The disciple whom Jesus loved was sitting next to Jesus at the table, leaning close him. ||| Kunid eda an hugidaj an daha g Jesus ahni mo ni‑hekaj si pihk e elid.
<sax> Simon Peter motioned to him to ask Jesus which one he was talking about. ||| D hekaj g Simon Peter wabsh s‑aꞌagi ab ni‑ahgid mant wo kakke mas hedai hab ahg.
<sax> So he leaned over to Jesus and asked, “Lord, who is it?” ||| Kunid wabsh s‑aꞌagi ab epai kakke g Jesus mas hedai hab ahg.
<sax> Jesus replied, “It's the one to whom I will give a piece of bread after I have dipped it.” ||| D hab kaij ab ni‑wui, “Hegai mant wehpeg ab wo bih o d hegai.” Kud wa woho am ge bia g hidod k ab mah g Judas Iscariot.
<sax> After dipping the piece of bread, he gave it to Judas, son of Simon Iscariot. Once Judas had taken the bread, Satan entered him. “What you're going to do, do it quickly,” Jesus told him. ||| D am wabsh i chum huh g e‑bih. D g ge Jiawul am baꞌich i chikp eda.
<sax> No one at the table understood what Jesus meant by this. ||| Kuchd pi shaꞌi amichud mas haschu hab ahg ch hab kaij ihda.
<sax> After he'd left, Jesus said, “Now the Son of man is glorified, and through him God is glorified. ||| D hab hahawa kaij g Jesus, “Neh, hemu at wehs wo e nahto hegai mat g Jiosh am i ni‑kei mant hab wo juh ia jewed dahm. Am ani wa chehgid g Jiosh gewkdag.

<sax> Simon Peter asked him, “Where are you going, Lord?” Jesus answered, “You can't follow me now where I'm going. You will follow me later.” ||| D hab kaij g Simon Peter, “A pt hebai wo hih, ni‑kownalig?”
<sax> “Lord, why can't I follow you now?” Peter asked. “I'll lay down my life for you.” ||| D hab kaij g Peter, “Nt haschu ahgk pi wo ni‑nako mant wo m‑oi hemuch? Ni‑nahtokch ani mant wo m‑wehhejed muh.”

How can you say, ‘Show us the Father’? ||| D hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Tash ani ia em‑wehmaj. Kupki eda pi woho ap ni‑mahch, ahpi Philip. Hegai mo hedai i ni‑neid ch hab masma ep neid g ni‑ohg.

<sax> I'll do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified through the Son. ||| Kunt am hab wo em‑juni mamtp haschu ab wo i tai g ni‑ohg am ni‑chehchegk. T heg hekaj g hemajkam ab wo si hehgchul g ni‑ohg Jiosh.
<sax> Whatever you ask for in my name, I will do it. ||| Pegih, mt haschu ab wo i tai g ni‑ohg am ni‑chehchegk, nt ahni hab wo juh.
<sax> If you love me, you will keep my commands. ||| “Am g hab wo junihid g ni‑chehanig mamtp woho ab wo si ni‑tatchuad.
<sax> I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Comforter, ||| Nt ab wo tai g ni‑ohg mat ab wo em‑mah g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. T heg chum hekid wo em‑wehmajk ch am wo i em‑tashogidad g wohokam.
<sax> the Spirit of truth, who will always be with you. The world cannot accept him because it isn't looking for him and does not know him. But you know him because he lives with you and will be in you. ||| Pi o ta neidagma g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. T heg hekaj pi wo shaꞌi e nako mas wo s‑mahchk hegam mo pi ni‑mahch.

<sax> I will not abandon you like orphans: I will come back to you. ||| “Pi ant ia hu hejel wo em‑dagito k wabshaba ia wo wa em‑wehm haꞌichugk am i dahm mant im hu wo uhpam hih.
<sax> Soon the world will not see me anymore, but you will see me. Because I live, you will live too. ||| Kumt wo s‑mahchk mant ia wo em‑wehmajk.

<sax> Jesus replied, “Those who love me will do as I say. My Father will love them, and we will come and make our home with them. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Hegai mo hedai ab si ni‑tatchua at wo wohog el g haꞌichu ni‑ahga. Kut hahawa ab wui wo si pihk e elidad g ni‑ohg. Kutt g ni‑ohg wehm am haha wo i t‑maskogi wui k am wo wehmajkad.
<sax> Those who don't love me don't do what I say. These words don't come from me, they come from the Father who sent me. ||| Pi at ab hu wo wohog el g haꞌichu ni‑ahga hegai mat pi ab hu wo ni‑tatchua. K eda g ni‑ohg d amjedkam ihda haꞌichu ni‑ahga.
<sax> I'm explaining this to you while I'm still here with you. ||| “Id ani hi wa em‑ahgid hemuch mani ia em‑wehmaj.
<sax> But when the Father sends the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, in my place, he will teach you everything and remind you of all that I told you. ||| T g ni‑ohg ab haha wo cheha g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag mat heg am wo i em‑wehmajk am ni‑wehhejed ch wo em‑gewkemhunad ch wo em‑mashcha mani haschu i s‑em‑mashchamamk ch hab wo em‑juh mamt wehs haꞌichu wo s‑chegitok mani haschu i em‑ahgid.
<sax> Peace I leave you; my peace I'm giving you. The peace I give you is nothing like what the world gives. Don't let your minds be anxious, and don't be afraid. ||| “Am g wabsh wo i s‑ap e tahtkkad. Ab ant wo i em‑mah hegai hab mahs s‑ap tahhadkam mani ahni edgid. Pi at hedai wo e nako mat hab mahs s‑ap tahhadkam wo em‑mah. Pi g wo shaꞌi e kudutad ch pi haꞌichu wo ehbidad.
<sax> You've heard me tell you, ‘I am going away, but I will come back to you.’ If you really loved me, you would be happy because I'm going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I. ||| “Am am wa ni‑kah mani wa hab kaij mant gam hu wo hih ab em‑amjed k wabshaba ia wo wa ep em‑wehmajk.

<sax> I can't talk to you much longer, for the prince of this world is coming. He has no power to control me, ||| “Hemu at am geꞌe wo chehgi g e‑gewkdag g jijawul ha‑geꞌejig no pi chum e kownalchud ia jewed dahm.

<sax> He cuts off every one of my branches that doesn't bear fruit. He prunes every branch that bears fruit so it can bear even more. ||| Hegai iꞌibhonigaj at ab wo chum bahidagt.

<sax> You are already pruned and made clean  through what I've told you. ||| “Heki am hu kegchudas ahpim mam ab kaiham ch ab s‑wohog elid g haꞌichu ni‑ahga.
<sax> Remain in me, and I will remain in you. Just as a branch cannot produce fruit unless it remains part of the vine, so it is for you: you cannot bear fruit unless you remain in me. ||| Pi g gam hu hab wo shaꞌi i e juhni ab ni‑amjed.

<sax> I'm the vine, you're the branches. Those who remain in me, and I in them, will produce much fruit—for apart from me you can't do anything. ||| “Pi at ab hu wo bahidagt g iꞌibhonig pi ab hu giꞌikch e‑waꞌug ab. Mt ahpim hab waꞌap pi wo e nako mamt haꞌichu s‑kehg hab wo juh mamt gam hu hab wo i e juh ab ni‑amjed.
<sax> Anyone who doesn't remain in me is like a branch that is thrown out and dries up. Such branches are gathered together, thrown into the fire and burned. ||| Hegai iꞌibhonig mat wo e hikkumia at am wo i e hemapad k wo e mei. Neh, id o hab mahs matp hedai gam hu hab wo i e juh ab ni‑amjed k ab wo e ahijidach mat hahawa pi haꞌichu wehhejed wo s‑kehgajk am Jiosh wehhejed.
<sax> If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, then you can ask for whatever you want, and it will be given you. ||| Ab ant wo i em‑mah mamt haschu ab wo i ni‑tai mamtp ab wo s‑wohog elidad g haꞌichu ni‑ahga ch ab wo ni‑hiwgad.
<sax> My Father is glorified as you produce much fruit, proving you are my disciples. ||| Hegam matp hedai woho ab i e dagitokch ni‑wui at muꞌi haꞌichu hab wo junihid ni‑wehhejed. T heg hekaj ab wo hehgchul g hemajkam g ni‑ohg Jiosh.
<sax> As the Father loved me, so I have loved you. Remain in my love.  If you do what I say, you will remain in my love, just as I do what my Father says and remain in his love. ||| “Bani masma si em‑tatchua ch si pihk em‑elid mo hab masma si ni‑tatchua g ni‑ohg. Ab ani si s‑wohog elid g ni‑ohg. Ch ab aꞌai si pihk t‑elid. Kumt ahpim hab waꞌap ab wo s‑ni‑wohog elidad. Tt ab aꞌai wo si pihk t‑elidad.
<sax> There is no greater love than to give your life for your friends. ||| Hegai matp hedai wo e muhkid ha wehhejed g e‑naipijju o d hegai mo woho si pihk e elid ha hekaj.
<sax> You're my friends if you do what I tell you. ||| Ahpim am d ni‑naipijju mamtp hab wo junihid g ni‑chehanig.
<sax> I don't call you servants any longer, for servants are not taken into their master's confidence. I call you friends, for everything my Father told me I've explained to you. ||| Kuni hahawa pi hab em‑aꞌaga mam d wabsh ni‑pionag ch wabshaba hab em‑aꞌaga mam d ni‑naipijju nani pi ab em‑ahgid wehs haꞌichu mani ab kah ni‑ohg amjed.

<sax> You didn't choose me, I chose you. I have given you the responsibility to go and produce lasting fruit. So the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. ||| Pi amt hejel e elid k am wo i gegokiwua ni‑wehhejed. Ahni ant am i em‑chuhcha mamt am wo hihim k hab wo juh g geꞌe chikpan.

<sax> This is my command to you: love one another. ||| Pegih, id ani ab em‑chehani mamt ab aꞌai wo pihk e elidad.”
<sax> If the world hates you, remember that it hated me before it hated you. ||| D hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Mt wo s‑chegitok mo ahni wehpeg s‑ni‑kehꞌid hegam mo pi ab hu tatchua g Jiosh ch hab waꞌap wo s‑em‑kehꞌidad.
<sax> If you were part of this world, it would love you as its own. But you're not part of the world, and I chose you out of the world—that's why the world hates you. ||| Ab at wo em‑tatchua mamtp hems pi ab hu wo tatchua g Jiosh. Nt wabshaba ab si em‑gawulkai ab ha amjed. Kum pi ha wepo chegito haꞌichu. K hekaj hab s‑em‑kehꞌid.
<sax> Remember what I told you: servants aren't more important than their master. If they persecuted me, they will persecute you too. If they did what I told them, they will do what you tell them too.  But everything they do to you will be because of me, for they don't know the One who sent me. ||| Mt wo s‑chegitok mani wa hab em‑ahgid mat pi hebai g pion hab wo chum e elidad mas baꞌich d i ge haꞌichu mo g e‑ahmo.

<sax> But I will send you the Comforter from the Father. When he comes, he will give evidence about me. He is the Spirit of truth who comes from the Father. ||| “Ab ant wo cheha g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag mat am wo em‑wehmajk. Heg o am wehmaj g Jiosh ch ab em‑wui wo him k wo em‑wehmajkad ch am wo i em‑gewkemhunad ch am wo haꞌichu em‑tashogidad ab ni‑amjed.
<sax> You will also give evidence about me because you were with me from the beginning. ||| Kumt ahpim wo i ahgahi ab ni‑amjed nam pi ni‑wehmajkahim ga hu i amjed mant am i shonwuich g ni‑chikpan.”
<sax> I've told you this so you won't give up your trust in me. ||| D hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Am ani em‑ahgid ihda mamt heg hekaj pi wo ni‑dagito.
<sax> They will expel you from the synagogues—in fact the time is coming when those who kill you will think they are doing God a service. ||| T wo i em‑wuwhas ab amjed g cheopi. K ab him g tash mamt wo em‑muꞌa k hab wo e ahgad mat wehhejed hab juh g Jiosh.
<sax> They'll do this because they have never known the Father or me. I've told you this so that when these things happen, you'll remember what I told you. ||| Id amt hab wo em‑juh heg hekaj mo pi ni‑mahch ch ep pi mahch g ni‑ohg.
<sax> I didn't need to tell you this right at the beginning because I was going to be with you. ||| Mt wabshaba wo s‑chegitok mani id am em‑ahgid mat hekid hab wo i e juh.”
<sax> But now I'm going to the One who sent me, and yet not one of you is asking me, ‘Where are you going?’ ||| K wabshaba hemu e aihim mant uhpam wo hih am ni‑ohg wui. M eda pi ab hu shaꞌi s‑ni‑kakkeimk manis hebai wo hih
<sax> Of course, now that I've told you, you're full of grief. ||| ch wabsh pi ap e tahtk s‑mahchok mant gam hu wo hih.
<sax> Sin, for they don't trust in me.  What is right, for I'm going to the Father and you won't see me any longer. ||| Ni‑ohg at ab wo ni‑haꞌichuch mant am wui wo him k pi ia hu wo haꞌichugk.

<sax> Judgment, for the ruler of this world has been condemned. ||| k ep wo wohokamch mat wo e lodai hegam mo hab junihim g pi apꞌekam nat pi am wa e ai mat g Jiosh wo lodai g ge Jiawul.
<sax> There's much more I want to explain to you, but you couldn't stand it now. ||| “Muꞌi ani haꞌichu ep s‑em‑ahgidamk. Mt wabshaba pi wo e nako mamt wo s‑amich mant wo chum em‑ahgi hemuch.
<sax> However, when the Spirit of truth comes, he will teach you the whole truth. He doesn't speak for himself, but he only says what he hears, and he will tell you what's going to happen.  He brings me glory for he teaches you whatever he receives from me. ||| Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag at am wo i em‑tashogi g wohokam k am ep wo i em‑ahgi mat haschu has wo e juh imhab em‑baꞌich. Nt am wo ahgi mat has wo chei. Kut am wo em‑tashogid k hab ab wo si ni‑haꞌichuch.
<sax> All that belongs to the Father is mine. This is why I said that the Spirit teaches you whatever he receives from me. ||| Wehs g ni‑ohg gewkdag o d ep ni‑gewkdag. Ni hekaj hab kaij mat g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag am wo i em‑tashogi mani haschu ab i ahgid.”
<sax> In a little while you won't see me anymore, but then a little while after that you will see me.” ||| D hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Do shaꞌi haꞌas, mt pi an hu wo ni‑neidad, ch am ep wo shaꞌi haꞌas, mt hahawa ep wo ni‑neidad.”
<sax> Some of his disciples said to one another, “What does he mean, ‘In a little while you won't see me, but a little while after that you will see me’? and ‘For I'm going to the Father’?” ||| Kuchd hab kaij ab aꞌai t‑wui, “Shahchu o hab ahg ch hab kaij mas wo shaꞌi haꞌas, tt pi an hu wo neidad, ch am ep wo shaꞌi haꞌas, tt ep wo neidad. K wa hab ep kaij mat wo hih am e‑ohg wui.
<sax> They were asking, “What does he mean by ‘in a little while’? We don't know what he's talking about.” ||| Pi ach shaꞌi amichud mo haschu hab ahg ch hab kaij.”
<sax> A woman in labor suffers pain because her time has come, but once the baby is born, she forgets the agony because of the joy that a child has been brought into the world. ||| Neh, s‑mahch am mat has wo e juh mat hekid wo e ai mat wo mahmadho g uwi.

<sax> When that time comes you won't need to ask me for anything. I tell you the truth, the Father will give you whatever you ask in my name. ||| “Mt hahawa pi ab hu wo ge ni‑kaiamad haꞌichu ch wabshaba ab wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahunad ch ab wo kakke g ni‑ohg am ni‑chehchegch. T wa woho wo em‑mah.
<sax> Until now you haven't asked for anything in my name, so ask and you shall receive, and your happiness will be complete. ||| Pi am koi hekid ni‑chehcheg am e hoꞌigeꞌidahunch. Am g hab wo i e juhni. T g ni‑ohg am hab wo em‑juni. T ab wo si e shuhdad g em‑doakag g s‑hehgigkaj.”
<sax> I've been talking to you using picture language. But soon I won't use such picture language any more when I speak to you. Instead I'll explain the Father to you very plainly. ||| D hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Am ani haꞌichu i chum em‑tashogid g haꞌichu wepogida ahgakaj. Ab o him g tash mant hahawa si tasho wo em‑ahgi ab amjed g ni‑ohg.
<sax> At that time you will ask in my name. I'm not saying to you that I will plead with the Father on your behalf, ||| T ab haha wo em‑abk mamt ab wo i e hoꞌigeꞌidahunad ni‑ohg wui am ni‑chehchegch. Pi amt heg wo waꞌi hiwgad manis ahni am wo waꞌi ni‑hoꞌigeꞌidahunad em‑wehhejed.
<sax> for the Father himself loves you—because you love me and believe that I came from God. ||| Ni‑ohg o ab si em‑tatchua nam pi ab si ni‑tatchua ch ab s‑wohochud mant ia jiwia ab amjed g Jiosh.
<sax> I left the Father and came into the world; now I leave the world and return to my Father.” ||| Ia ant woho jiwia ab amjed g ni‑ohg id dahm jewed. T e ai mant uhpam ep wo hih am ni‑ohg wui.”
<sax> “Are you really convinced now?” Jesus asked. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus, “Nam hig hab elid mam id woho s‑wohochud?
<sax> “The time is coming—in fact it's just about to happen—when you will be scattered, each of you to your own homes, leaving me all alone. But I'm not really alone, for the Father is with me. ||| Ab o e aihim mamt gam hu aꞌai wo si e gantad k gam hu uhpam wo hihi e‑kihki wui ia hejel ni‑dagitok. Ni wabshaba pi hejelig.

<sax> I've told you all this so that you may have peace because you are one with me. You will suffer in this world, but be brave—I have defeated the world!” ||| “Wehs ani em‑ahgid ihda mamt heg hekaj wo si s‑ap e tahtkkad. T wo em‑shoꞌigch hegam mo pi ab hu tatchua g Jiosh.

<sax> When Jesus finished saying this he looked up to heaven and said, “Father, the time has come. Glorify your Son so that the Son may glorify you. ||| D am i kuhgi g Jesus g haꞌichu e‑ahga k am i nea dahm kahchim wui k am e hoꞌigeꞌidahun k hab kaij, “Ni‑ohg, ia at i e ai g ni‑tashga.

<sax> “Are you Jesus of Nazareth?” they asked. ||| D hab kaij idam, “Hegai Jesus mo ab Nazareth t ab d kihkam.”
<sax> When Jesus said “I am,” they fell back and dropped to the ground. ||| D haha wabsh e totods hegam k ab taꞌi si i gegokiwua k wabsh i shul.
<sax> So he asked them again, “Who are you looking for?” ||| D ab ep ha kakke g Jesus, “A m hedai in gahg?”
<sax> “I already told you I am,” Jesus replied. “So if I'm the one you're looking for, let these others go.” ||| D hab kaij g Jesus, “Am ani wa heki hu em‑ahgid mani d ahni. Mtp ahni in wo ni‑gahghid ch pi has wo ha juh idam.”
<sax> These words fulfilled what he had previously said: “I have not lost any of those you gave me.” ||| Neh, bo kaij no pi s‑t‑doꞌibiamk. Kud hab masma hab e juh g neꞌokij mo wa hab kaij matt wehsijj wo t‑doꞌibia.
<sax> Then Simon Peter drew a sword and struck Malchus, the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. ||| D g Simon Peter ge is‑pahyo ch ab i huhpan k ab hu wabsh si i widut k higshp an si hikuch g s‑apkojed nahkaj hegai mo d uhgchu pahl neholiga ch hab chehgig Malcus.
<sax> First they took him to Annas, the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the current high priest. ||| Am ad kih g uꞌugchu papal. Kud gan hu wehpeg i bei heg wui mo hab chehgig Annas. Ihda Annas o d baꞌamad ohgaj hegai mo d si uhgchu pahl ch hab chehgig Caiaphas.
<sax> Caiaphas was the one who had told the Jews, “It's better that one man die for the people.” ||| K d ihda Caiaphas mad wa am ha shelinid g hahaꞌichu mat hemako wo muh g oꞌodham wehs ha wehhejed.
<sax> Simon Peter followed Jesus, and another disciple did so too. This disciple was well-known to the high priest, and so he entered the high priest's courtyard with Jesus. ||| Kuchd gohkajj g Simon Peter wehm am i ha oi mo am bebhehim g Jesus. K eda g uhgchu pahl s‑ni‑mahch. Nid hekaj am i wah kolhai ch ed.
<sax> Peter had to remain outside by the door. So the other disciple who was known to the high priest went and spoke to the servant girl watching the door and brought Peter inside. ||| D g Peter ga hu waꞌi kehk jeg ed ab kihjeg t ab. Nid am hahawa him k ab ahgid hegai chehia mad ab nuhkud g kihjeg mat ab wo i wahki g Peter.
<sax> The girl asked Peter, “Aren't you one of that man's disciples?” ||| D hab kaij ihda chehia ab wui g Peter, “Nap hig pi ahpi an ep wehmaj hegai mamt an bei?”
<sax> It was cold, and the servants and guards were standing by a fire they had made, warming themselves. Peter went and stood with them, warming himself. ||| D eda s‑hehpid. D hekaj am ge nahdch g pion ch cheopi nuhkuddam ch am gegok ch e huhkalid. D g Peter am him k am ha wehm i kekiwua k e huhkal.
<sax> Then the chief priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and what he had been teaching. ||| D g uhgchu pahl ab kakke g Jesus mas haschu ahgk ab haꞌi i ha gawulkad k haschu ha mashcham.
<sax> “I've spoken openly to everyone,” Jesus replied. “I always taught in the synagogues and in the Temple where all the Jewish people meet. I haven't said anything in secret.  So why are you questioning me? Ask the people who heard me what I told them. They know what I said.” ||| D hab kaij g Jesus, “P haschu ahgch ahni ab ni‑kakke? Pi ani hekid s‑aꞌagi haꞌichu ahg ch wabshaba wehs hemajkam wui hab kaij ch am ha mashcham ha‑cheopi ed ch geꞌe cheopi ch ed mach am wehs t‑hehemapad. Pegih, ab g hig ha kakke mani haschu i ha mashcham. S‑mahch o mani haschu ha ahgid.”
<sax> Annas sent him, his hands still tied, to Caiaphas the high priest. ||| D g Annas am hahawa ha cheha mat am wo uꞌapa Caiaphas wui. Kud an wabsh kia wulshch g Jesus.
<sax> As Simon Peter stood warming himself by the fire, the people there asked him, “Aren't you one of his disciples?” ||| D eda g Peter am wabsh kia e huhkalid ha‑nahda wui. D hab kaij hegam mad am wehmaj, “Nap hig pi ahpi an ep wehmaj hegai mamt an bei?”
<sax> One of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked Peter, “Didn't I see you in the olive grove with him?” ||| D am hema kehk g neholigaj g uhgchu pahl ch d hajunij hegai mat g Peter hikuch g nahkaj ch hab kaij ab wui g Peter, “Nani pi woho m‑neid amai matt am bei ihda?”
<sax> Peter denied it again, and immediately a cock crowed. ||| D hab kaij g Peter, “Ih, piaꞌa.” D edapk am i kuhu g keli chuchul.
<sax> Early in the morning they took Jesus from Caiaphas to the palace of the Roman governor. The Jewish leaders didn't enter the palace because if they did they would be ceremonially defiled, and they wanted to be able to eat the Passover meal. ||| Wabsh i siꞌalim mad koi i chesh g tash, md gam hu i bei g Jesus kownal kih wui. D hab chehgig hegai Pilate. D pi am hu i wahp g Tutuligo kownal kih ed no pi g t‑himdag hab chuꞌig matt wo t‑uamhu mattp am wo i wahp gawul hemajkam ha‑kih ed. Kut pi wo apꞌedagk mat wo huh g kahwal mad iagchulig gegosig imhab i juhk matp am wo i wahp.
<sax> So Pilate came out to meet them. “What charge are you bringing against this man?” he asked. ||| D heg hekaj gam hu i wuhsh g Pilate k am ha nam k hab kaij, “Shahchu am ab abchud ihda oꞌodham?”
<sax> “If he wasn't a criminal, we would not have handed him over to you,” they answered. ||| D hab kaij ab wui, “Pi att woho ia wo uꞌapa ahpi m‑wui hegai matt pi koi wo s‑mai mo am hab junihim g pi apꞌekam.”
<sax> “Then you take him and judge him according to your law,” Pilate told them. ||| D hab kaij g Pilate, “Pegih, mt ahpim wo be k ab wo mah g s‑koꞌok namkidadag mo has i mahs g em‑himdag chehanig.”
<sax> “Did you think of this question yourself, or did others talk to you about me?” Jesus responded. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus, “Nap ab ni‑kakke ihda ab hejel e amjed, aha no haꞌijj ab haꞌichu i m‑ahgid ab ni‑amjed?”
<sax> “Am I a Jew?” Pilate countered. “It was your own people and high priests who handed you over to me. What is it that you've done?” ||| Kud hab kaij g Pilate, “Pi ani d shaꞌi Tuhligo manis wo s‑mahchk ihda. M‑wehm hemajkam ha wehm g e‑papalig at ia m‑uꞌapa. Pt haschu has juh?”
<sax> Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not of this world. If it was of this world, my subjects would fight to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from here.” ||| D hab kaij g Jesus, “Ni‑kownaltalig o pi hab chuꞌig mo g id dahm jewed kokownaltalig, Tp hems hab wo chuꞌigk, t wo ha cheggia hegam mo ab si ni‑wecho e mashcham mamt pi am hu wo i ni‑dagito hahaꞌichu ha wui. Pi o hab mahs g ni‑kownaltalig.” Neh, bad kaij g Jesus.
<sax> Then Pilate asked, “So you are a king, then?” ||| D heg hekaj hab ep kaij g Pilate, “Kupki woho hab kaij map d kownal!”
<sax> “What is truth?” Pilate asked. ||| D gam hu hab si e widu g Pilate k hab kaij, “Mas haschu d i wohokam.”
<sax> However it is customary for me to release a prisoner to you at Passover. Do you want me to release the King of the Jews?” ||| K eda wehs ahid ab am hema i e dadagitod g lihso em‑wehhejed iaꞌi idani mam wushshad g e‑shohshon ha‑doꞌibiadag. Pegih, nam tatchua mant id wo dagito mash d em‑kownalig ahpim Tutuligo?”
<sax> “No, not him! We want Barabbas instead!” they shouted back. Barabbas was a rebel. ||| D si s‑kaidam hihnk ch hab kaij, “Pi hegai. Barabbas ach tatchua.” D eda d s‑chu ehskam ch d ha muꞌakam ihda Barabbas.
<sax> Then Pilate took Jesus and had him flogged. ||| D am hahawa ha cheha g Pilate g shondal mat wo s‑koꞌokam gewitta g Jesus. Kud wa woho hab e juh
<sax> Pilate went outside once more and said to them, “I'm bringing him out here to you so you'll know I find him not guilty of any crime.” ||| D am ep i wuhsh g Pilate k hab kaij am ha wui g hemajkam, “Nehꞌe, ab ant ep wo i wuhshad k wo em‑chehgi mant pi haꞌichu shaꞌi cheh g pi ap chuꞌijig mas hekaj wo e muhkid.”
<sax> Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. “Look, here's the man,” said Pilate. ||| Md am hahawa i wuhshad k ab wabsh kia wahkch g hoꞌi gihko ch hegai kownal kahba.
<sax> When the chief priests and the guards saw Jesus, they shouted out, “Crucify him! Crucify him!” ||| D am i nei g uꞌugchu papal ch cheopi nuhkuddam k si s‑kaidam hab wabsh ge kaij muꞌikko, “Muꞌani! Muꞌani ab kots t ab!”
<sax> The Jewish leaders replied, “We have a law, and according to that law he must die because he claimed to be the Son of God.” ||| D hab kaij hegam Tutuligo, “Ahchim at hi melchkwua g t‑chehanig am hugkam mat hemho wa wo e muhkid no pi hab e aꞌaga mo d Jiosh alidag.”
<sax> When Pilate heard this he was more afraid than ever, ||| Neh, d am i ha kah g Pilate mad hab kaij idam k baꞌich i e ebkiod
<sax> and he went back into the governor's palace. He asked Jesus, “Where do you come from?” But Jesus didn't respond. ||| k gam hu uhpam i wah k hab kaij ab Jesus wui, “Bahp amjed him?”
<sax> “Are you refusing to talk to me?” Pilate said to him. “Don't you realize that I have the power to have you released or to crucify you?” ||| D hab ep kaij g Pilate ab wui, “Aha, napt pi has wo chei ab ni‑wui k eda s‑mahch mani gewkdag mant wo m‑dagito o ab wo m‑mua kots t ab!”
<sax> “You would have no power over me unless it had been given to you from above,” Jesus answered. “Therefore the one who handed me over to you is guilty of the greater sin.” ||| D hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Jiosh at ab m‑mah hegai gewkdag. K heg hekaj si pi ap hab e wua idam Caiaphas mo m‑piꞌichud mapt pi ap wo hekaj g e‑gewkdag.”
<sax> It was around noon on the preparation day before the Passover. ||| D eda e aihim g dahm juhk. Kud wo e kokda g kahwal mahmad imhab i juhk mat wo e wuhshad g t‑shohshon ha‑doꞌibiadag. D hab kaij g Pilate ab ha wui g hahaꞌichu, “Ia g hu wo neid g e‑kownalig.”
<sax> “Kill him! Kill him! Crucify him!” they screamed out. ||| D ab ep si s‑babgam hihnk ch hab kaij, “Muꞌani! Muꞌani ab kots t ab!”
<sax> So he handed Jesus over to them to be crucified. ||| D am hahawa i dagito g Pilate g Jesus mamt ab wo mua kots t ab.
<sax> They led Jesus away, who carried his own cross, and went out to the “Place of the Skull,” (Golgotha in Hebrew). ||| D g Jesus am kushwiot g hejel e‑kots. Kuchd am dada amai mo am e kokda. Bach aꞌaga amai Golgotha mo hab d ahga Koshwak.
<sax> They crucified him there, and two others with him: one on either side, with Jesus between them. ||| Kumt gam si wuahawua g wehschugaj k ab sisish kots t ab k ab uhgk i bei. D eda gohk d ep lilso. Kumd idam hab waꞌap ab ha sisish kokots t ab k gan hu aꞌaijed ha chuhcha Jesus hugid an.
<sax> Pilate had a notice made and placed on the cross which said, “Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.” ||| D an sisishp g tapial Jesus kots t ab. K an ab hab chuꞌig:
<sax> Then the chief priests came to Pilate and asked him, “Don't write ‘the King of the Jews,’ but ‘This man said I am the King of the Jews.’ ” ||| D gam hu uhpam ep hihi g uꞌugchu papal Pilate wui am i neꞌokchulidk ihda k hab ahg, “Pi g hab masma an oꞌohan mo d t‑kownalig k wabshaba an oꞌohan mo heg hejel hab kaij mo d t‑kownalig.”
<sax> Pilate replied, “What I have written I have written.” ||| D hab kaij g Pilate ab ha wui, “Mant haschu an i oꞌoha, t heg an wo oꞌohadagk.”
<sax> So that is what the soldiers did. ||| D am gegok g jeꞌej ch jiskaj g Jesus miabidch amai mo am naggia. Kud gohk am ep ha wehmaj mo hema d hegai Mary mo g wehmaj kihkam d Clopas ch hema d ep Mary Magdalene.
<sax> When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple he loved standing beside her, he said to his mother, “Mother, this is your son.” ||| Nid ahni am ha wehm kehk mo ni‑hekaj si pihk e elid g Jesus. Kud g Jesus an ni‑aꞌaga ch hab ahg g e‑jeꞌe, “Neh, id at d haha wo m‑madk m in kehk,”
<sax> Then he said to the disciple, “This is your mother.” From then on the disciple took her into his home. ||| ch hab ep ni‑ahg, “Id at d haha wo m‑jeꞌek.” Neh, nid am i amjed bei g jeꞌej. Kud heg am t‑wehm kih.
<sax> Jesus now realized that he had finished all that he had come to do. In fulfillment of Scripture, he said, “I'm thirsty.” ||| D hahawa s‑mahch g Jesus mat wehs hab juh mat haschu hab wo chum juh mat koi wo muh ch hab kaij, “Tonom ant.”
<sax> A jar of wine vinegar was standing there, so they soaked a sponge in the vinegar, put it on a hyssop stick, and held it to his lips. ||| D an hema daha g haꞌa mad am shuhdagi g pad nawait. D am hema g shondal haꞌichu wakch pad nawait ch ed k an haꞌichu k an uskon k ab uhgk i be k ab kams hab masma mo an oꞌohadag Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana ed.
<sax> After he'd had the vinegar, Jesus said, “It's finished!” Then he bowed his head and breathed his last. ||| D ab i winiun k hab hahawa kaij, “Ia ant i wehs haꞌichu nahto.” Neh, bad kaij ch am hahawa jumal i moꞌowua k am i muh.
<sax> It was preparation day, and the Jewish leaders didn't want to leave the bodies on the crosses during the Sabbath day (in fact this was a special Sabbath), so they asked Pilate to break the legs, so that the bodies could be removed. ||| D am e nakog g hemajkam mat wo e mihshmad nat pi g baꞌich tash d wo shahwaik ch d wo geꞌe tashk. Kutsh g hahaꞌichu ab kakke g Pilate mat wo e ohmi g ha‑kakhio hegam mad am nahngia. T hab wo e oiwigi g ha‑muhkig mat gam hu wo i e uꞌu k pi ab wabsh wo kia nahngiak t‑mihshmda tash ed, wahm mat id d wo si geꞌe t‑tashgak.
<sax> So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first one and then the other of those crucified with Jesus, ||| D ab ha chehani g Pilate g shondal mat wo ha ohmi g ha‑kakhio. Kud hab ha juh hegam gohk mo ab hugidaj ab nahngia g Jesus.
<sax> The one who saw this has given this evidence, and his evidence is true. He's certain that what he says is true so you can believe it too. ||| Id anid neid ch s‑mahch mat woho muh. Kuni hab masma am em‑ahgidahim mamt ahpim hab waꞌap wo s‑mahch mat woho muh.
<sax> It happened like this so Scripture would be fulfilled: “Not one of his bones will be broken,” ||| Jiosh oꞌohana o hab chuꞌig:
<sax> and as another Scripture says, “They will look at the one they pierced.” ||| K an ep oꞌohanas ch hab chuꞌig:
<sax> After this Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate if he could take down the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave his permission. Joseph was a disciple of Jesus, but in secret because he feared the Jews. So Joseph came and took the body away. ||| K hema d Joseph ch ab Arimathea t amjed ch s‑wohochud mo g Jesus d Jiosh si Kehsha ch wabshaba s‑ha gihug hegam mo pi hohhoꞌid. D wabshaba hekid am i muh g Jesus, d id am hih Pilate wui k ab e shoꞌigchud k ab tahni g honshpadaj. D am i hiwigi. D ga hu ep jiwia k ab i huduni g muhki k gam hu i bei.
<sax> He was joined by Nicodemus, the man who had first visited Jesus at night. He brought with him a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about seventy-five pounds. ||| D heg am ep haꞌichug Nicodemus mat wa ged hu i wehpeg chehgim g Jesus chuhug ch ed. Idam atsh s‑ap wo juh g muhki. D g Nicodemus heg hekaj uꞌa g siant s‑wehch hegai mo d s‑ap uhw haꞌichu ch d myrrh ch aloes.
<sax> They took Jesus' body and wrapped it in linen cloth together with the mixture of spices, in accordance with Jewish burial customs. There was a garden near where Jesus was crucified;  and in the garden was a new, unused tomb.  Since it was the Jewish day of preparation and the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus to rest there. ||| S‑e ad hohtkid nad pi hudunihim. D baꞌich tash d t‑mihshmda tash. K eda an mia cheotas hodai ch ed mamt am hab juh g hihaꞌini k wabshaba koi shaꞌi hekaj. K an wehgaj eshas g uꞌus.

<sax> Early on the first day of the week, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and saw that the stone had been moved from the entrance. ||| Domig wabsh i siꞌalim mad wabsh kia s‑chuhugam, tsh gm hu hihi hegam Mary Magdalene k am dada cheo t am. Kutsh heki hu gam hu i e nuꞌichkwua g hodai mad hekaj ab chum kuhpi.
<sax> So she ran to tell Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one Jesus loved, “They've taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they've put him.” ||| Tsh am chum neid k am hahawa uhpam meh kihhim wui k ad gd hu t‑wui mel ahni John ch Simon Peter k am t‑ahgid ch hab kaij, “Am atki i e wuhshad g t‑kownaligbad hon heg amjed hihaꞌini mat am e cheh. Kuch pi shaꞌi mahch mas hebai has e juh.”
<sax> He bent down, and looking in he saw the grave-clothes lying there, but he didn't go in. ||| Nid am i koachsh k nei mo am wehch hegai s‑kehg ikus k wabshaba pi am hu i wah.
<sax> Then Simon Peter arrived after him and went right into the tomb. He saw the linen grave-clothes lying there, ||| D am hahawa mel g Peter k am wabsh si i wah k cheh hegai ikus
<sax> and that the cloth that had been on Jesus' head wasn't with the other grave-clothes but had been folded and placed on its own. ||| ch heg ehp mat hekaj e hobino g Jesus moꞌo. D id ged hu hab wabsh hejelko holiwek ch kahch.
<sax> Then the other disciple who had reached the tomb first went inside as well. ||| Kunid ahni am hahawa epai i wah k am i neidok ab hahawa i s‑wohoch mat woho i wuhsh ab muhkig amjed.
<sax> He looked around and believed it was true for up till then they hadn't understood the Scripture that Jesus had to rise from the dead. ||| Kuchd eda pi koi s‑amichud hegai Jiosh oꞌohana mo hab chuꞌig mat hemho wa wo i wuhsh ab muhkig amjed.
<sax> Then the disciples went back to where they were staying. ||| Kuchd gam hu hahawa hihi uhpam.
<sax> But Mary stayed outside the tomb crying, and as she was crying, she bent down and looked into the tomb. ||| Sh am ep oimmed g Mary cheo kihjego ch shoak ch atsh am i e jumalkad k am i koachsh hihaꞌini ch ed
<sax> She saw two angels in white, one sitting at the head and the other at the foot of where Jesus' body had been lying. ||| ch ash gohk ha neid g anghil. Idam ash s‑tohtam e enigadadch ch ga hu aꞌai dadha, hema ab moꞌoshko ch hema ga hu aigo
<sax> “Why are you crying?” he asked her. “Who are you looking for?” ||| Sh eda d Jesus ch ab kakke ch hab kaij, “Uwi shahchu ap ahgch shoak? Dohp in gahg?”
<sax> Jesus said to her, “Mary!” ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Mary.”
<sax> “Don't hold onto me,” Jesus said to her, “for I haven't yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brothers and tell them I am ascending to my Father and your Father, my God and your God.” ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “Pi g am hu ni‑shohbid. Koi ant am hu hih ni‑ohg wui. Pt wabshaba am wo him k am wo ha ahgi g ni‑naipijju mant wo uhpam i ni‑nodagi heg wui mo d ni‑ohg ch ahpim d ep em‑ohg. Heg o d ni‑Jioshga ch ahpim d ep em‑Jioshga.”
<sax> So Mary Magdalene went and told the disciples, “I've seen the Lord,” and she explained to them what he had said to her. ||| D wa woho am uhpam hih g Mary Magdalene k am t‑ahgi mo neid g t‑kownalig Jesus. K heg am ahgid ihda.
<sax> That evening, on the first day of the week, as the disciples were meeting together behind locked doors because they were afraid of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said, “May you have peace.” ||| D gam hu si i juh domig hudunk. Kuchd am t‑nam hema kih am. D ga hu si yahwidag g kihkjeg nachd pi s‑ha ehbid g hahaꞌichu.
<sax> After this greeting he showed them his hands and his side. The disciples were full of joy to see the Lord. ||| ch ab hahawa t‑chehgid g e‑nohnhoi ch e‑huda. Kuchd si s‑hehgig ab i neidok.
<sax> “May you have peace!” Jesus told them again. “In the same way the Father sent me, so I'm sending you.” ||| D hab ep kaij ab t‑wui, “Am g wabsh wo s‑ap e tahtk. Am ant i em‑chuhcha hab masma mat g ni‑ohg am i ni‑kei. Kumt hab waꞌap am wo ahgachugad g haꞌichu ahgaj.”
<sax> Saying this, he breathed on them, and told them, “Receive the Holy Spirit. ||| T hab chei ihda k ab t‑dahm ihbheiwua k hab kaij, “Ab g wo i behꞌi g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag.
<sax> So the other disciples told him, “We've seen the Lord.” ||| Kuchd am hahawa chum ahgid matt nei g t‑kownalig.
<sax> One week later the disciples were together inside the house; and Thomas was with them. The doors were closed, and Jesus came and stood among them. ||| Hemako domig amjed, chd am ep i t‑hemapai kih ch ed. D am hahawa t‑wehmaj g Thomas. Chd ab ep si yahwidadch g kihkjeg. D wabshaba ab i wah g Jesus k am jiwia t‑wui k hab kaij, “Am g wabsh wo si s‑ap e tahtk.”
<sax> Then he said to Thomas, “Put your finger here, and look at my hands. Put your hand in the wound on my side. Stop doubting and trust in me!” ||| D hab hahawa kaij ab Thomas wui, “Ab g i ni‑neid k ab tahtam g ni‑nohnhoi ch ni‑huda k ab wo s‑ni‑wohochudad.”
<sax> “My Lord and my God!” Thomas responded. ||| D hab hahawa chei g Thomas, “Ni‑kownalig ch ni‑Jioshga!”
<sax> “You trust in me because you've seen me,” Jesus told him. “Happy are those that haven't seen me yet still trust in me.” ||| D hab ep kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Ab apt i s‑ni‑wohoch nap pi ni‑neid. Baꞌich at wo i s‑hehgigk hegam mat ab wo i s‑ni‑wohoch wa chum pi g e‑wuhpuikaj ni‑neidch.”
<sax> Jesus did many other miraculous signs while he was with his disciples that are not recorded in this book. ||| Muꞌi s‑hasig haꞌichu ad hab ep juh g Jesus am t‑nena ed mant pi oꞌoha id eda oꞌohana.
<sax> But these are written down here so that you may trust that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by trusting in him as he is you will have life. ||| Nt id in hi wa ha oꞌoha mamt ab amjed wo s‑wohoch mo g Jesus d Jiosh si Kehsha ch d alidaj k hab masma ab wo bei g wechij doakag.
<sax> Later Jesus appeared again to the disciples by the Sea of Galilee. This is how it happened. ||| Am waꞌi hebai amjed, d am ep i e chehgi g Jesus t‑wui amai al kahchki am am Galilee jewed ch ed.
<sax> When dawn came Jesus was standing on the shore, but the disciples didn't know it was him. ||| D ab i chesh g tash. D ab hema kehk shuhdagi hugidgo. Kuchd pi shaꞌi mahch mo hedai wud.
<sax> Jesus called to them, “My friends, haven't you caught anything?” ||| D hab kaij, “Wihpiop, namt pi haꞌichu shaꞌi bei?”
<sax> “Throw the net out on the right side of the boat, and you'll find some,” he told them. So they threw out the net, and they weren't able to haul it in because it had so many fish. ||| D hab hahawa kaij, “An g wo daꞌichud g e‑chuagia inhab s‑apkojed g e‑wahlko k wo haꞌi ha ui.”
<sax> The disciple Jesus loved said to Peter, “It's the Lord.” When Peter heard it was the Lord, he put some clothes on since he was naked, and jumped into the sea. ||| Nid hab hahawa kaij ab Peter wui, “Doki t‑kownalig Jesus!” D am i kah g Simon Peter moki d Jesus k ab wah g e‑eniga mat wuahawua k am i dah shuhdagi ch ed k am i e wachwihim k ga hu jiwia wui.
<sax> The other disciples followed in the boat, pulling the net full of fish, because they were not far from the shore, only about a hundred yards. ||| Chd ahchim haꞌi ab hahawa i himch g wahlko ab chewaimedch g chuagia waptopi shuhdch nachd pi am waꞌi waik siant keishpa ab amjed mo an i hug g shuhdagi.
<sax> Once they'd landed they saw a fire with fish cooking on it, and some bread. ||| Kuchd an i huhud shuhdagi koa an k nei mo g chuhdagi am wehch. D am dahm kahch g watopi. D g pahn am ep wehch.
<sax> Jesus told them, “Bring some of the fish you've just caught.” ||| D hab kaij g Jesus ab t‑wui, “Ab g wo haꞌi uꞌuk g waptopi em‑uꞌi.”
<sax> Simon Peter went aboard and pulled the net full of fish ashore. There were 153 large fish, yet even so the net hadn't torn. ||| Ab ad wabsh i si shuhdags g chuagia g geꞌeged waptopikaj. Kud g Simon Peter gan hu i chesh wahlko ch ed k ab i chewaim. Kud d siant hetaspo wehst‑mahm gamai waik (153). D eda pi e wantsh g chuagia.
<sax> This was the third time Jesus had appeared to the disciples after being raised from the dead. ||| Id o d waꞌi waikkokam mad am i e chehgi g Jesus t‑wui amjed mad ab i wuhsh muhkig amjed.
<sax> After breakfast, Jesus asked Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?” ||| Kuchd am i t‑nahto t‑gegosidk. D hab kaij g Jesus ab Simon Peter wui, “Simon map d Jonas alidag, nap baꞌich i si pihk e elid ni‑hekaj mo hi idam?”
<sax> “Take care of my lambs,” Jesus told him. “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” he asked for the second time. ||| D hab ep kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Simon, nap woho si pihk e elid ni‑hekaj?”
<sax> “Look after my sheep,” Jesus said to him. “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” he asked a third time. ||| D id d i waikko mad hab kaij g Jesus, “Simon, nap ab si ni‑tatchua?”
<sax> “I tell you the truth,” said Jesus, “when you were young, you dressed yourself and went wherever you wanted. But when you're old, you'll hold out your hands and someone will dress you and take you where you don't want to go.” ||| Neh, s‑mahch ap map hejel s‑ap an has i e wua ch am hab e junihim map has i tatchua.

<sax> Jesus said this to explain the kind of death by which he would glorify God. Then he said to Peter, “Follow me.” ||| Kudki heg hab ahg matki has masma wo e muhkid g Peter. T hab wo s‑mai g hemajkam g Jiosh gewkdag. Kud g Jesus hab hahawa ahg g Peter mat gam hu hasko wo oi.
<sax> As Peter turned round, he saw the disciple Jesus loved following them, the one who had leaned over to Jesus during the supper and asked, “Lord, who is going to betray you?” ||| D am wehmaj i hih g Peter. Nid ab i ha oi. Kud g Peter ab uhpam i nea k ni‑neid
<sax> Peter asked Jesus, “What about him, Lord?” ||| k hab kaij ab Jesus wui, “Ni‑kownalig, kut haschu am hab wo e juh am tahgio ihda John.”
<sax> This disciple confirms what happened and wrote all this down. We know that what he says is true. ||| Ahni ani wud manid neid ch kah ch ia oꞌoha. Kuni si s‑mahch mo d wohokam.
<sax> Jesus did many other things as well, and if it all was written down, I doubt the whole world could hold all the books that would be written. ||| Neh, muꞌi ad haꞌichu hab ep juh g Jesus. Tp hems am wo i e oꞌohanahi wehs k wabsh wo shuhd g jewed.
<sax> May God's mercy, peace, and love increase in your experience! ||| Ab ani tahni g Jiosh mat ab baꞌich wo i s-em-hoꞌigeꞌidad ch ab baꞌich wo i em-mahkad g s-ap dahhadkam ch pihk elidadag.
<sax> My friends, I was already looking forward to writing to you about the salvation that we share. But now I need to write urgently to you and encourage you to vigorously defend the truth about God,  given once and for all time to God's holy people.  For some people have quietly crept in among you. They were written about and condemned a long time ago, for they are wicked people who pervert God's grace, turning it into a license to immorality, while also denying our Lord and master Jesus Christ. ||| Ab ant haꞌichu wo i chum em-oꞌohani ab amjed g t-doꞌibiadag. T wabshaba haꞌi i wuwha mo d s-chu iꞌattomkam ch am chum gawul s-junimk g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ab amjed g doꞌibiadag ch ab wui gegok g t-kownalig Jesus Christ.

<sax> Even though you already know this, I want to remind you that though the Lord saved his people out of the land of Egypt, later he still destroyed those who disbelieved. ||| Am g wo s-chegitok mat has ha juh g Jiosh hegam mo pi ab hu wohog elid. Chum as wehs e doꞌibia g Tutuligo ab Egypt jewed t amjed, k eda muꞌijj pi ab hu wohog elid g Jiosh ch hekaj s-koꞌokam e koꞌij.
<sax> Even those angels that were not content with their God-given positions but abandoned their rightful places—he has placed them in eternal chains of darkness until the great Day of Judgment. ||| Am g wo s-chegitok mat has e juh g anghil.

<sax> In just the same way, Sodom and Gomorrah and the towns nearby that pursued immorality and perverted sex are provided as an example of those that experience the punishment of eternal fire. ||| Am g wo s-chegitok mat has i ha juh hegam mo am kih Sodom kihhim t am ch Gomorra kihhim t am ch gan hu ha wehgaj.

<sax> They're in terrible trouble! For they have followed Cain's way. Like Balaam and his delusion, they have abandoned themselves to the profit motive. Like Korah and his rebellion, they have destroyed themselves. ||| Jiosh at s-koꞌokam wo ha namkid no pi pi ab hu wohog elid.
<sax> These people spoil your fellowship meals, for they are selfish shepherds that don't have the slightest sense of shame—they only take care of themselves. They're clouds blown along by the wind that bring no rain. They're bare trees without fruit—twice dead, pulled out by the roots. ||| Kah ani mash idam s-chu iꞌattomkam am em-wehm e gegosid ch am chum em-uamhun.
<sax> They're violent ocean waves, foaming in their own disgrace. They're false stars, doomed forever to utter darkness. ||| S-ta edam haꞌichu ash am wabsh e chehgid ab ha amjed hab masma mo g totshagi am e chehgid an shuhdagi hugid an. Idam o wabsh pi dodolima ch ab aihim mat g Jiosh gm hu wo ha shul geꞌe s-chuhugam k ed.
<sax> Enoch, seven generations on from Adam, spoke prophetically about these people: “Look! The Lord is coming, together with thousands and thousands of his holy ones  to judge everyone, to reveal all the wicked things people have done, and all the terrible things hostile sinners have said against him.” ||| Tsh wabshaba g Jiosh heki hu hema tashogi mat has wo ha juh.

<sax> Such people are grumblers, always complaining. They follow their own evil desires, speaking boastfully about themselves, and flattering others to get what <span class="it">they</span> want. ||| Idam s-chu iꞌattomkam o chum hekid aꞌaga g pi e-apꞌedag ch hab wua g pi ap e-tatchui.

<sax> But you, my dear friends, please remember what you were told by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ. ||| Am g wo s-chegitok mo haschu i em-ahgid hegam mo d chuhchaij g t-kownalig Jesus Christ.
<sax> They explained to you that in the last times mockers would come, following their own wicked desires. ||| Bo wa kaij ab em-wui, “Am at haꞌi wo i wuwha em-shahgid mo eda e aihim g si ha oidch tash k hab wabsh wo junihid g hejel e-tatchui ch wo nahnko em-ahgad.”

<sax> Show kindness to those who doubt. ||| Ab g wo i s-ha hoꞌigeꞌid hegam mo pi mahch mas haschu wo s-wohoch
<sax> Save those you can by snatching them out of the fire. Show mercy—but with great care, hating even the “clothing” that is contaminated by sinful human nature. ||| k am wo i ha ahgi g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. T hab wo e doꞌibia ab i s-wohochudk.

<sax> As you know, many others have attempted to put down in writing the things that have been fulfilled  that involve us.  They based their accounts on evidence from the earliest eyewitnesses and ministers of the Word,  and so I also decided that since I have followed these things very carefully from the beginning, it would be a good idea to write out an accurate account of all that happened.  I have done this dear Theophilus so you can be certain that what you were taught is completely reliable. ||| Ni-nawoj map ab si tatchua g Jiosh:
<sax> During the time when Herod was king of Judea, there was a priest called Zechariah, who came from the Abijah priestly division. He was married to Elizabeth, who was also descended from Aaron the priest. ||| Amjed atsh ab i shohshonwua ihda mash eda g Herodbad am d kownal Judea chekshani ch ed am ha dahm g Tutuligo hemajkam.

<sax> They had no children because Elizabeth wasn't able to have any, and they were both growing old. ||| Kutsh wabsh okst ihda Elisabed k pi ha mahmadt. Tsh g Zacaria hab waꞌap kelit.
<sax> While Zechariah was serving as a priest before God, on behalf of his priestly division, ||| Kutsh hema tash am i e ai matsh g Abiabad amjedkam am hab wo juh g e-chikpan geꞌe cheopi ch ed.

<sax> When Zechariah saw the angel, he was startled and became terrified. ||| Tsh am i nei g Zacaria k si e todsid k si s-ehbeni ihda.
<sax> But the angel told him, “Don't be afraid, Zechariah. Your prayer has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you shall call him John. ||| Kush wabshaba hab kaij g anghil, “Pi g am shaꞌi e todsid, Zacaria.

<sax> Some time later his wife Elizabeth became pregnant. She stayed at home for five months. “The Lord has done this for me,” she said, “now that he's taken away my disgrace in the eyes of others.” ||| Kush amai i mia amjed matsh woꞌiwua g ali.

<sax> In the sixth month of her pregnancy God sent the angel Gabriel to a young girl called Mary who lived in the town of Nazareth in Galilee.  She was engaged to a man named Joseph. ||| Neh, tsh am him k am d i chuhdp mashad am i dahm matsh am woꞌiwua g Elisabed mad.

<sax> And Elizabeth, your relative, even she is pregnant in her old age. The woman that people said couldn't have children is already six months pregnant. ||| “Neh, s-mahch ap mat heki hu okst g m-hajuni Elisabed k pi ha mahmadt. Kut eda g Jiosh ab s-hoꞌigeꞌel.

<sax> A little while later, Mary got herself ready and hurried up into the hills of Judea, to the town where  Zechariah's house was.

<sax> “But there's nobody among your relatives who has this name,” they told her. ||| Sh hab kaij hegam, “Pi o hedai hab shaꞌi chehgig g m-hajuni,”
<sax> Through gestures they asked Zechariah, the boy's father, what he wanted to call his son. ||| ch amjed ab wabsh i chum kakke g ohgaj mat am wo ha ahgi mas has wo chehch.

<sax> When the time of their purification according to the law of Moses was finished, Joseph and Mary took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord,  as the law of the Lord states, “Every firstborn son must be dedicated to the Lord.”  There they made a sacrifice, as God's law also states, of “a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons.” ||| Tsh am i e ai g tash matsh g Mary am wo e chehgi mo kegchudas mat hab masma g Mosesbad an oꞌoha g Jiosh chehanig.

<sax> Simeon took Jesus in his arms, thanked God, and said, ||| Tsh g Simeon an koh g ali k ab si e hoꞌigeꞌidahun Jiosh wui hab kaijch.
<sax> Jesus' father and mother were shocked at what Simeon said about him. ||| Sh g Joseph ch Mary si has e tahtk heg hekaj mo has i kaij ab amjed g ali.
<sax> Then Simeon blessed them, and said to Jesus' mother Mary, “This child is destined to cause many in Israel to fall and many to rise.

<sax> She came up to them right at that moment, and began praising God.

<sax> They assumed he was with all the others traveling home.

<sax> His parents were totally confused when they saw what he was doing. His mother asked him, “Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I—we've been worried sick!

<sax> But they didn't understand what he meant. ||| Sh eda pi shaꞌi amichud mo haschu ahgch hab kaij.

<sax> Jesus grew steadily wiser and stronger, favored both by God and by the people. ||| Neh, kutsh ab si s-gegokam i geꞌehogatahi g Jesus k baꞌich i edagi g amichudadag k ash am si oid g Jiosh chehanig. Kush ab si s-hoꞌigeꞌid g Jiosh. Sh g hemajkam ab si has elid.
<sax> By now Tiberias had been Caesar for fifteen years. Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea. Herod was ruler of Galilee, his brother Philip was ruler of Iturea and Trachonitis, and Lysanius was ruler of Abiline.  Annas and Caiphas were the current high priests. This was the time when the word of God came to John, Zechariah's son, who was living in the desert. ||| Tsh am hebai i cheka. Kush am daha ihda John mo d Zacariabad alidag am tohono jewed ch ed.
<sax> He went throughout the whole Jordan region, announcing to everyone that they needed to be baptized to show they had repented and their sins had been forgiven. ||| Sh g John an wehsko ahgachug g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga anai Jordan akimel woꞌoshani ed hab ha ahgch, “Gam g hu wo s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegitoi k wo e pahl wapko.

<sax> The ax is set to begin chopping at the base of the trees. Any tree that doesn't produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown into the fire.” ||| Kumt ahpim gam hu wo s‑e ohhod hab masma mat g pi kehg bahidkam uꞌus mamtp pi gam hu wo s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegitoi k pi am hu hab wo junihid g s‑apꞌekam.”
<sax> “So what should we do?” the crowds asked him. ||| Kush haꞌi g hemajkam ab kakke, “Pegih, tt has hig wo chum t‑juh?”
<sax> “If you have two coats, then share with someone who doesn't have one.

<sax> Some tax collectors came to be baptized. “Teacher, what should we do?” they also asked. ||| Kush haꞌi hegam matsh am wui dada k wo e pahl wapko d lial ha kowlantdam am kownal wehhejed ch ash ab kakke, “T‑mashchamdam, tt ahchim has wo chum masmak?”

<sax> The people were waiting expectantly, and wondered whether John himself might be the Messiah. ||| Kush g hemajkam pi am hu dodolimad am oidahimch mas hu id d Jiosh si Kehsha matsh wo ha doꞌibia.
<sax> John replied and explained to everybody, “Yes, I am baptizing you in water. But the one who is coming is more important than me, and I'm not worthy to undo his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. ||| Kush heg hekaj hab kaij g John, “Pi g hab wo ni‑elid manis ahni d si haꞌichu. Ab at hema wo i wuhsh ni‑oidk mat d wo si haꞌichuk.

<sax> But when John reprimanded Herod the ruler for marrying Herodias, Herod's brother's wife, and for all the evil things he'd done, ||| Sh eda hegai kownal mash hab chehgig Herod geꞌe hab junihim g pi apꞌekam ch atsh g e‑wehnag ehs g hohnigaj.

<sax> Herod added to his crimes by having John thrown into jail. ||| Tsh g Herod am baꞌich i pi ap haꞌichu hab juh matsh ged hu si kuh g John.
<sax> Now it happened that after everyone had been baptized, Jesus was baptized as well. As he was praying, heaven was opened, ||| Tsh wabshaba koi e kuh g John k wehs ha pahl wapko hegam matsh am wui e chehm ab s‑wohochudch g Jiosh.

<sax> and the Holy Spirit descended upon him, taking the form of a dove. A voice came from heaven, saying, “You are my son, the one I love.

<sax> Jesus was around thirty when he began his public ministry. People presumed he was the son of Joseph. Joseph was the son of Heli, ||| Jesus ash am hu d i waikko wehst‑mahm aꞌahidag matsh eda am i himch g e‑chikpan k am i ahgahi g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.

<sax> Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan River and was led by the Spirit into the desert, ||| Jesus atsh gam hu hih ab amjed g Jordan akimel matsh hebai e pahl wako. Kush g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ab mahkch g si geꞌe gewkdag ch hab ahg mat gam hu wo hih am tohono jewed wui.

<sax> Jesus taught in their synagogues, and everyone praised him. ||| Kush am ha mashcham ha eꞌeda g ha‑chechopi. Sh wehsijj ab si has elid g hemajkam.
<sax> He rolled up the scroll and gave it back to the attendant. Then he sat down. Everybody in the synagogue was staring at him. ||| Tsh g Jesus ab i holiwkai g oꞌohana k ab uhpam mah g nuhkuddam k am hahawa dahiwua mat haꞌichu hab wo chei. Sh wehsijj ab si kaiham mat has wo chei.

<sax> Everybody expressed their approval of him, amazed at the gracious words that came from his lips. “Isn't this Joseph's son?” they wondered. ||| Tsh wehsijj ab si has i el no pi si s‑ap neok k wabshaba hab kaij, “Aha no hig pi woho d Josephbad alidag?”
<sax> Jesus replied, “I'm sure you'll repeat this proverb to me, ‘Physician, heal yourself!’ and ask, ‘Why don't you do here in your own hometown what we heard you did in Capernaum?’ ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “No hig pi woho mamt ab ni‑wui hab wo chei hegai hab ha‑cheꞌidag mo hab chuꞌig, Am g i e maskogid maptp d ge mahkai, k hab ep wo chei, Ia g hu hig hab ep juhni g s‑hasig haꞌichu e‑kih am mapsh has masma am hab ge junihim Capernaum kihhim t am.”
<sax> But I tell you the truth, no prophet is accepted in his hometown. ||| Sh hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Mo wa woho mam pi ab hu has elid g Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam amai mo hebai d i si kihkam.
<sax> I guarantee that there were many widows in Israel during the time of Elijah when there was a drought for three and a half years, causing a great famine throughout the country. ||| Elijabad wehm oꞌodham ash wa hab masma pi ab hu has elid.

<sax> But he walked right through them and went on his way. ||| Tsh wabshaba g Jesus am wabsh ha shahgid wuhshani k gam hu hih.

<sax> They were amazed at what he taught them for he spoke with authority. ||| Kutsh wehsijj si has i el kaiok mo has masma ha mashcham no pi si s‑e mamachim neok.
<sax> In the synagogue there was a man who was possessed by a demon. He cried out, ||| Sh am hema daha mo g jiawul an uꞌukch. Kush si s‑kaidam hihnk ch hab kaij,
<sax> “So, what do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are: God's Holy One!” ||| “Gam g hu hihm ahpi Jesus map ab Nazareth t ab d kihkam. A napt hab ahgk ia jiwia mapt wo t‑kokda. S‑mahch ani map hedai wud. Dap Jiosh si hekia s‑apꞌekam kehsha.”

<sax> News about Jesus spread throughout the nearby region. ||| Kutsh wehsko e kah ihda anai heg oidk jejewed.
<sax> When the sun set, they brought to him all who were sick, suffering from various diseases. Jesus placed his hands on them, one after the other, and he healed them. ||| Tsh gam hu hud g tash.

<sax> Demons came out of many people, shouting, “You are the Son of God.” But Jesus stopped them and refused to let them speak because they knew he was the Christ. ||| Tsh muꞌi ab wui i hihi hegam mo g jijawul an ha uꞌukch.

<sax> Early the following morning Jesus left to find some peace and quiet. But the crowds went out looking for him, and finally found him. They tried to stop him leaving because they did not want him to go. ||| Sh am hu hebai wabsh i siꞌalim, tsh g Jesus gam hu jegko i wuhsh. Tsh am i gahghi g hemajkam k am i chehg k chum pi hiwigi mat wo hih ab ha amjed.

<sax> So Jesus went on traveling around, teaching the good news in the synagogues of Judea. ||| Tsh wa woho am i ha mihshmdahi wehsko ha‑chechopi ed amai Galilee chekshani ch ed.
<sax> One day, as Jesus was standing beside the Sea of Galilee, people crowded around him to hear the word of God. ||| Sh am hu hebai g Jesus an kehk mo an i koa hegai al kahchki mo hab chehgig Galilee Kahchki. Kutsh g hemajkam ab wabsh i shodbinidahi s‑kaimkch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.

<sax> Jesus got into a boat, the one that belonged to Simon, and asked him to push it out into the water, just offshore. Then Jesus sat down in the boat and taught the people from there. ||| Kutsh am i chesh g Jesus hema ha eda idam wapalko. Sh heg d Simon eniga. Sh hab ahg matsh am wo shaꞌi nuꞌichkwua shuhdagi ch ed.

<sax> Having done this, a large shoal of fish filled the nets full to breaking point. ||| Kutsh wa woho am hihim k am i ha huhuds ge e‑chuchagia k atsh shaꞌi si muꞌi waptopi ha ui matsh chum alo e wanikumia g ha‑chuchagia.
<sax> They waved to their partners in the other boat, asking them to come over and help. The others came over and together they filled both of the boats with fish. The boats were so full that they began to sink. ||| Kush am haꞌi ep chikpan hema wahlko ch ed. Kumtsh idam ab hahawa si ha wai mat am wo i ha wehmt. Tsh wa woho ab i himch g e‑wahlko k wehs ha shuhshud g waptopikaj mat chum alo wachkk g ha‑wapalko.
<sax> When Simon Peter saw what had happened, he dropped to his knees before Jesus. “Lord, please stay away from me, for I am a sinful man!” he exclaimed. ||| Tsh am i nei g Simon mat haschu has i e juh k ab si i gei g e‑tohtonkaj Jesus wui k hab wabsh kaij, “Ih, dani wabsh pi apꞌekam oꞌodham.

<sax> For he and everybody with him were completely amazed by the catch of fish that they had landed. ||| Kutsh wehsijj hegam mash wehmaj si e totods neidch mat has e juh.
<sax> James and John, the sons of Zebedee, Simon's partners, felt the same way. ||| Haꞌi hegam wehmaj chikpandam g Peter ash d James ch John ch ash d aꞌalidaj hegai mash hab chehgig Zebedee.

<sax> Once when Jesus was visiting one of the towns, he met a man there who had a very bad case of leprosy. The man fell with his face to the ground and begged Jesus, “Please Lord, if you're willing, you can make me clean.” ||| Sh am hu hebai g Jesus am hasko kihhim ch ed oimmed.

<sax> But Jesus often used to retreat to quiet places and pray. ||| Tsh g Jesus am wo ha mihshmad k wo ha dodajid k amjed gam hu hejelko wo him k wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahu.
<sax> One day when Jesus was teaching, the Pharisees and religious teachers who had come from all over Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem were sitting there. The power of the Lord to heal was with him so he could heal. ||| Sh am hu hebai ehp mash g Jesus am ha mashcham.

<sax> But they couldn't find any way through the crowd, so they went up on the roof and made a hole in the roof tiles. Then they lowered the man down on the mat, right into the crowd in front of Jesus. ||| Kush am i chum s‑wahkidamk kih ch ed matsh wo chehgi g Jesus ab si hiwigch mat wo doaj.

<sax> The religious teachers and the Pharisees began to argue with that. “Who is this who's speaking blasphemies?” they asked. “Who can forgive sins? Only God can do that!” ||| Kush hegam chehanig ha mashchamdam ch Palasi wabsh hejel hab e ahg, “Ih, shaꞌi si pi ap neok ihda oꞌodham hab masma e wepogidch g Jiosh.

<sax> Later, as Jesus was leaving the town, he saw a tax collector called Levi sitting at his tax booth. ||| Sh hema d lial kowlantdam g kownal wehhejed ch hab chehgig Levi. Tsh g Jesus am cheh. Kush am daha heg eda kih mo am chikpan.
<sax> Levi stood up, left everything, and followed Jesus. ||| Tsh g Levi am ha hekaj i wuhshani k am wabsh i dagito wehs haꞌichu k gam hu i oi.
<sax> Levi organized a large banquet at his home in Jesus' honor. Many tax collectors and others were in the crowd that sat down to eat with them. But the Pharisees and the religious teachers complained to Jesus' disciples, asking,  “Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?” ||| Am waꞌi mia amjed, tsh g Levi am hab juh g geꞌe gegosig am wehhejed g Jesus.

<sax> One Sabbath while Jesus was walking through grainfields, his disciples began picking some heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands, and eating them. ||| Sh am hu hebai hihim idam Jesus ha mihshmda tash ed.

<sax> But Jesus knew what was in their minds. He told the man with the crippled hand, “Get up, and stand here in front of everyone.” The man got up and stood there. ||| Sh g Jesus s‑mahch mo haschu am chegito ch ash hab kaij heg wui mahnikokam, “Kekiwuani k ab i hihm ia hu ha baꞌich g hemajkam.” Tsh ab i kekiwua.

To save life, or to destroy it?” ||| Sh g Jesus ab hahawa ha kakke ch hab kaij, “Shahchu am ahgch hab elid mo pi hiwgidas mihshmda tash ed mamt wo i ha wehmt hegam mo e shoꞌigchud?

<sax> He looked round at all of them there. Then he said to the man, “Hold out your hand.” The man did so, and his hand became like new. ||| Neh, bash kaij ch an hahawa wehsijj i ha neid k hab hahawa kaij ab wui hegai oꞌodham, “Ab g si i shelin g e‑nowi.” Kutsh am wabsh i chum shelin k am waꞌi hekaj apꞌet.

<sax> Looking at his disciples, Jesus told them, ||| Tsh g Jesus ab i ha nei hegam mash ab si hiwig k hab kaij:

<sax> Do to others what you want them to do to you. ||| Bamt wo ha juhkchid g hemajkam mam has i chum ha elid mat hab wo em‑juhkchid.
<sax> If you lend money expecting to be repaid, why should you deserve any credit for that? Sinners lend money to other sinners as well, expecting to be repaid what they loaned. ||| Pi at wo em‑mah g s‑ap tahhadkam g Jiosh mamtp hegam waꞌi haꞌichu wo ha hiwigi mam hab ha elid mat wo wa uhpam em‑mah.

<sax> No: love your enemies, do good to them, and lend without expecting to be repaid anything. Then you will receive a great reward, and you will be children of the Most High God, for he is kind to ungrateful and wicked people. ||| “Neh, mt ab wo pihk e elidad ha wui g e‑obga ch am hab wo ha junidad g s‑ap haꞌichu ch wo haꞌichu ha mah mamt pi ab hu uhpam wo ge neidad.

<sax> Good people produce what's good from the good things they value that they have stored inside them. Bad people produce what's bad from the bad things they have stored inside them.

<sax> A centurion lived there who had a servant he greatly valued who was sick and was about to die.  When he heard about Jesus, the centurion sent some Jewish elders to him, asking him to come and heal his servant. ||| Kush amai am hema d shondal ha‑geꞌejig ch ab d ha‑kehsha Rome t amjed ch kah ab amjed g Jesus.

<sax> Jesus went with them and as they approached the house, the centurion sent some friends to Jesus to tell him, “Lord, please don't trouble yourself by coming into my house, because I'm not worthy of that. ||| Kutsh gam hu ha oi g Jesus k am i aihi g kihj hegai shondal ha‑geꞌejig.
<sax> I didn't even think that I was worthy to come and see you. Just give the command, and my servant will be healed. ||| o manis hejel am wo hih m‑wui. Am apt hab wabsh wo chea. T wo doa g ni‑pionag.
<sax> For I'm under the authority of my superior officers, and I have soldiers under my authority too. I command one to go and he goes, another to come and he comes.

<sax> When Jesus heard this he was astounded.

<sax> along with a number of women who had been healed from evil spirits and sickness: Mary called Magdalene from whom he had cast out seven demons; ||| Kutsh muꞌi am ha oi g uꞌuwi. Idam atsh wa ha dodaj g Jesus. Kush am haꞌichukaj i ha wehmt. Hema idam ash d Mary Magdalene. Id atsh g Jesus ab amjed i ha wuwhas g wewaꞌak jijawul.
<sax> Joanna, the wife of Herod's manager Chuza; Susanna; and many more who provided support from their personal resources. ||| Kush hema d Joanna.

<sax> Some fell on stony ground, and once the seeds had sprouted they withered for lack of moisture. ||| T haꞌi gan hu shul mo pi geꞌej g jewed ab waw t ab. T ab i chum wuhsh g eꞌes k wabsh gaksh no pi pi wadag amai.
<sax> Some seeds fell among thorns and as they both grew the thorns choked the plants. ||| T haꞌi gan hu shul g kaichkaj shaꞌi ch ed. T heg am wabsh wehnadk i geꞌege k ha kokda g esha.
<sax> Some seeds fell on good earth and after they grew they produced a harvest one hundred times more than what had been sown.” After he told them this, he called out, “If you have ears, then listen!” ||| T wabshaba hegam mat an s‑ap shul moihuna ch ed an wuhshani k siant ab kait hehemako.” Sh hab hahawa ep kaij g Jesus, “Neh, am g wo i aꞌamichud ahpim mam kah ihda.”
<sax> But his disciples asked him, “What does this illustration mean?” ||| Kush g Jesus chuhchai ab kakke mas has d ahga ihda wepogida ahga.
<sax> Jesus replied, “You've been given insights into the mysteries of God's kingdom, but the rest are given illustrations, so that, ‘Even though they see, they don't really see; and even though they hear, they don't really understand.’ ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “Nt wo em‑ahgi mo has d ahga no pi g Jiosh em‑hiwgid mamt wo s‑mai hegai mo haschu hemu am maskogid ab amjed g e‑kownaltalig.

<sax> This is the meaning of the illustration: The seed is God's word. ||| Kush hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Neh, nt wo em‑tashogi ihda haꞌichu wepogida ni‑ahga. Jiosh haꞌichu ahga o wepogidas mo g haꞌichu kai ch am wo e gantad hemajkam ha‑iꞌibdag ed.
<sax> The seeds that fall on the road are those who hear the message, but then the devil comes and steals away the truth from their minds so they won't trust in God and be saved. ||| K eda haꞌi g ha‑iꞌibdag s‑kawpk hab masma mo g wohg. K g Jiawul am wabsh s‑pehegi ha wohppoꞌid hegai mo haschu i kah. T hab pi ab hu wo wohoch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga k pi wo e doꞌibia.
<sax> The seeds that fall on the stony ground are those who hear and welcome the message with joy but don't have any roots. They trust for a while but when difficult times come they give up. ||| “K haꞌi g ha‑iꞌibdag hab sha masma mo hebai pi geꞌej g jewed ab waw t ab.

<sax> You don't light a lamp and then cover it with a bucket, or hide it under a bed. No, you put it on a stand, so that anyone who comes in can see the light. ||| “Wohokam o wepogidas mo g lahmpa tonlig. Namt hig wo ehsto g lahmpa ab mehidk aha namt an wo dai mat hebai wo em‑tonlidch. Pegih, mt hab wa masma pi wo chum ehsto g wohokam.
<sax> For there's nothing hidden that won't be revealed; there's nothing secret that won't become known and obvious. ||| Wehs at wo s‑e mai matp haschu chum e ehstokch. T haschu wo i chum e maꞌishchid wo e chehg k am wo i e wuhshad.
<sax> So pay attention how you ‘hear.’ To those who have received, more will be given; from those who don't receive, even what they think they have will be taken away!” ||| “Am g wo s‑amichud mam haschu i kah. Hegam mat s‑ap wo hekaj g e‑apꞌedag at baꞌich ep wo i nei. T wabshaba hegam mat pi ap wo hekaj wabsh wo heb hu wua.”
<sax> Then Jesus' mother and brothers arrived, but they couldn't get through the crowd to see him. ||| Tsh am chum dada g Jesus jeꞌe ch wepngaj. Sh wabshaba si muꞌij g hemajkam an wehgaj. Kutsh pi e nako matsh ab wo miabi.
<sax> Jesus was told, “Your mother and your brothers are outside. They want to see you.” ||| Sh hema hab kaij ab wui g Jesus, “M‑jeꞌe ch m‑wepnag o am gegok jeg ed s‑m‑neidamkch.”
<sax> “My mother and my brothers are those who hear God's word, and do what it says,” Jesus replied. ||| Sh hab ahg g Jesus, “Neh, idam mo ab ni‑kaiham ch ab s‑wohog elid g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga o heg wa wepo mo d ni‑jeꞌe ch ni‑wepnag.”
<sax> One day Jesus said to his disciples, “Let's cross over to the other side of the lake.” So they got into a boat and set off. ||| Sh am hu hebai hab ha ahg g Jesus g e‑chuhchai, “Am att hu hig shuhdagi aigojed wo i chehchsh.” Tsh wa woho am dadhaiwua wahlko ch ed k am gahi i shul.
<sax> As they were sailing, Jesus fell asleep, and a storm came down on the lake. The boat began filling with water and they were in danger of sinking. ||| Sh am hebai him g wahlko shuhdagi ch ed. Tsh g Jesus am i woꞌiwua k koi. Kutsh g hewel ab haha wabsh i meh. Tsh ab i toꞌotonkai g shuhdagi k am iawua wahlko ch ed mash s‑ta ehbidam hab mahs ha wehhejed.
<sax> They sailed across to the Gerasene region that lies opposite Galilee. ||| Tsh am hihim k gam hu dada ga hu aigojed g Galilee shuhdagi heg maibidch kihhim mash d Geresa.
<sax> When Jesus stepped out of the boat onto the shore, a demon-possessed man from the town came to meet him. For a long time he hadn't worn any clothes or lived in a house. He lived in the tombs. ||| Kush am hema oimmed g cheoj jeg ed ch am chum kih heg eda kihhim. Sh wabshaba g jijawul an uꞌukch g chegitoidaj. Kush gan hu wabsh kih mash an chehchog ch an e hihashp g koꞌi.
<sax> When he saw Jesus he screamed, fell down at Jesus' feet, and asked in a loud voice, “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Please don't torture me, I beg you!” ||| Tsh id am chehg k si s‑kaidam hihnk ch ab i meh pi haꞌichu enigadadch mash hab wa chuꞌig k ab wui i gehsh k si s‑kaidam hab kaij, “Jesus, alidaj g si uhgk Jiosh, gam g hu hihm k pi koꞌokam has ni‑juhni.”
<sax> For Jesus had already commanded the evil spirit to leave the man. It had often seized him, and despite being tied down with chains and shackles, and placed under guard, he would break the chains apart and would be driven by the demon into the desert areas. ||| Bash kaij nash pi g Jesus ab si ha chehani g jijawul mat ab wo i wuwha amjed.
<sax> “What is your name?” Jesus asked him. “Legion,”  he replied, for many demons had entered him. ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Shahp chehgig?”
<sax> They begged Jesus not to order them to go into the Abyss. ||| Tsh g jijawul ab si e shoꞌigch Jesus wui matsh pi am hu wo ha shul Jiawul kih ed.
<sax> There was a large herd of pigs feeding on the nearby hillside, and the demons begged him to be allowed to go into the pigs. Jesus gave them permission, ||| Sh eda muꞌi an oiopo g kokji kawulk bahsho ch e gegosid. Sh idam jijawul ab si tahni g Jesus matsh am wo ha dagito. Tsh am wo i wahp ha eda idam kokji. Tsh am ha hiwigi g Jesus.
<sax> so the demons left the man and entered the pigs. The herd rushed down the steep slope into the lake and drowned. ||| Tsh ab i wuwha ab amjed g oꞌodham k am i wahp ha eda g kokji. Kutsh wehsijj idam kokji am agshp i wohp k gam hu shul shuhdagi ch ed k wachkk.
<sax> Those who had seen what happened explained how the demon-possessed man had been healed. ||| Kush hegam mash neid am ha ahgid mat has masma e doaj ihda oꞌodham.
<sax> Then all the people from the Gerasene region asked Jesus to leave because they were overwhelmed by fear. So he got into the boat and went back. ||| Kush wehsijj idam Geresa t am hemajkam ab ahgid g Jesus mat gam hu wo hih ab ha amjed natsh pi shaꞌi si s‑ehbeni. Tsh wa woho hab e juh k an dahiwua wahlko ch ed mat gam hu wo hih.
<sax> The man who had been freed from the demons begged to go with him, but Jesus sent him away. ||| Kutsh hegai oꞌodham matsh ab i wuwha g jijawul amjed ab si e shoꞌigch Jesus wui k hab kaij, “Nt wo m‑oi.”
<sax> “Go back home, and tell people all that God has done for you,” Jesus told him. So he went away, telling the whole town all that Jesus had done for him. ||| “Uhpam g hihm k am wo i ha ahgidahi mat haschu hab juh g Jiosh m‑wehhejed.”
<sax> A crowd of people was there to welcome Jesus when he returned, all eagerly expecting him. ||| Tsh ga hu aigojed hahawa ep dada hegam Jesus. Kush muꞌi hemajkam am nenida ch si s‑ap i e taht k ab i nei.
<sax> One was a man called Jairus, a synagogue leader, who came and fell at Jesus' feet. He pleaded with Jesus to come to his home  because his only daughter was dying. She was about twelve years old. ||| Tsh am hema jiwia g oꞌodham k hab chehgig Jairus ch wabsh d haꞌichu am cheopi ch ed. Sh id chehiaga muhkhim ch d gamai gohk aꞌahidag. Kutsh ab wecho si i gei g Jesus k ab ahgid matsh gam hu wo oi kihj wui. Tsh gam hu chum wehmaj hih g Jesus.
<sax> In the crowd was a woman who had suffered with bleeding for twelve years. She had spent all she had on doctors, but none of them had been able to help her. ||| Kush eda am hema haꞌichug g uwi ch gamai gohk aꞌahidag mumku heg hekaj mo g ehꞌedaj jegwoni. Tsh pi hedai e nako mas wo doaj, chum as wehs hugio g e‑lialiga ha namkidch g mamakai.
<sax> She approached Jesus from behind and touched the hem of his cloak. Immediately the bleeding stopped. ||| Kutsh ab i hih Jesus wehgaj k an taht g kahbaj hugidag. Kutsh am wabsh si haꞌasa g ehꞌed jegwoni.
<sax> When the woman realized she couldn't go unnoticed, she came forward, trembling, and fell down before him. Right in front of everybody she explained the reason why she had touched Jesus, and that she'd been cured immediately. ||| Tsh am i nei hegai uwi mamt s‑mai k ab hahawa i him k si gigiwek ch ab i gei Jesus wecho amai hemajkam ha tahgio k ash am ahgid g Jesus mat haschu ahgk ab taht k has masma ha hekaj doa.
<sax> Jesus said to her, “Daughter, your trust has healed you, go in peace.” ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Pegih, ni‑uwiga, am apt wa doa napt pi ab i ni‑hiw. Gamai g s‑ap e tahtk hihm k am wabsh s‑doakad.”
<sax> While he was still speaking, someone came from the home of the synagogue leader to tell him, “Your daughter's dead. You don't need to bother the Teacher any longer.” ||| Kush hab wabsh kia kaij ihda g Jesus. Tsh ab hema mel ab kihj amjed g Jairus k ash hab kaij, “Muh at g m‑chehiaga. Kupt pi am hu ep wo kudu g ha mashchamdam.”
<sax> But when he heard this, Jesus told Jairus, “Don't be afraid. If you trust, she will be healed.” ||| Kutsh kah g Jesus k hab kaij ab wui g Jairus, “Pi g am shaꞌi e todsid. Ab g wabsh i ni‑hiwig. Kut wabsh wo e chegito.”
<sax> When Jesus arrived at the house he didn't allow anyone else to go in except Peter, John, and James, and the girl's father and mother. ||| Kutsh ged hu dada kihj am. Tsh hegam waꞌi ha ui g Jesus Peter ch James ch John ch hegam jehjij g chehia. Tsh am e wehm i wahp.
<sax> All the people there were crying and mourning for her. ||| Kush eda wehsijj shoani ch pi ap e tahtk wehhejed g chehia. Kush hab kaij g Jesus, “Pi g am wo shoanid. Heg o wa wepo ni‑wehhejed mo wabsh kohsh g chehia.”
<sax> They laughed at him, because they knew that she was dead. ||| Kush wabsh has ahg hegam nash pi si s‑mahch mat muh.
<sax> But Jesus took her by the hand, and said in a loud voice, “My child, get up!” ||| Tsh wabshaba g Jesus ab bei nowij ab k ab si neok wui ch hab kaij, “I wamigi, chehia.”
<sax> Jesus called the twelve disciples together. He gave them power and authority over all demons, and the ability to heal diseases. ||| Am hu hebai, tsh am i ha wai g Jesus g e‑chuhchai. Tsh am wui i e hemapai. Kutsh ab ha mah g gewkdag mat gam hu wo i ha wuwhas g jijawul ab ha amjed hegam mo an ha uꞌukch k wo ha dodaj g kokꞌodam
<sax> Then he sent them out to proclaim God's kingdom and to heal the sick. ||| k am hahawa ha cheha mat am wo i ahgahi ab amjed g Jiosh kownaltalig.
<sax> “Take nothing with you for the journey,” he told them. “No staff, no bag, no bread, no money, not even any extra clothes. ||| Pi atsh koi hihi, sh hab ha ahg, “Gm amt wabsh wo i hihim k pi haꞌichu wo uꞌuk, chum hems pi g cheowikud nih g limoshan kostal nih g haꞌichu hugi nih g lial nih chum hems hema ep lihwa.
<sax> Whatever house you enter, stay there, and when you leave, leave from there. ||| Am amt wo dadkkad heg kih am mat hedai i si s‑ap ab wo i em‑nei am hugkam mamt hekid wo i hihi ab amjed hegai kihhim.
<sax> If people refuse to accept you, shake the dust off your feet when you leave town as a warning against them.” ||| Kutp hebai pi ap ab hu wo i em‑nei g hemajkam, mt am wo dagito hegai kihhim k ab wo si shahmud g e‑shuhshk mamt wo ha chehgi mamt wo ha dagito k pi wo ha ahgi ab amjed g Jiosh.”
<sax> They left and went around the villages, announcing the good news and healing everywhere they went. ||| Tsh wa woho am hihi idam chuhchaij ha oidk g kihhim k am ahgahim g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch ha doajid g hemajkam wehsko.
<sax> Herod the tetrarch had heard about all that was happening, and he was very puzzled. Some were saying that John had been raised from the dead; ||| Sh eda g Herod am wabsh kia d kownal Galilee ch ed ch am i kah wehs ihda mash haschu has e wua. Am amsh wehsko aꞌaga mas hedai wud ihda Jesus. Haꞌijj ash hab kaij, “Doki hegai Johnbad mo wa ha pahl wapkonahim. Heg amt mua. Kutki wabshaba uhpam e chegito.”
<sax> others that Elijah had appeared; still others that one of the ancient prophets had come back to life. ||| Kush haꞌijj hab kaij, “Doki Elijabad o hema ep hegam kekelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam.”
<sax> However the crowds found out where he was going and followed him there. He welcomed them and explained the kingdom of God to them, and healed those who needed healing. ||| Tsh am i kah g hemajkam k am i ha oi s‑neidamk g Jesus. Tsh g Jesus si s‑ap ab i ha neid k am ha ahgi ab amjed g Jiosh kownaltalig k ha dodaj g kokꞌodam.
<sax> Late in the day, the twelve disciples came to him and said, “You should send the crowd away now so they can go to the villages and farms nearby and find a place to stay and food to eat—there's nothing here where we are.” ||| Kutsh gam hu i juh. Tsh g chuhchaij am dada wui k hab kaij, “Am g ha chehani g hemajkam mat am wo hihi kihhim wui o am hasko oꞌoidag wui k wo bei g haꞌichu hugi k an hasko wo kohk heg hekaj mo ia hu wabsh si heb hu iia.”
<sax> “You give them something to eat!” said Jesus. ||| Sh wabshaba hab kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Ahpim amt wo haꞌichu ha mah mat wo huh.”
<sax> There were about five thousand men present. ||| Kush eda shaꞌi muꞌij g hemajkam mash hetasp mihl d chechoj.
<sax> The disciples did so, and everybody sat down. ||| Tsh wa woho hab e juh g chuhchaij. Kutsh wehsijj am i dadhaiwua.
<sax> Jesus picked up the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed the food and broke it into pieces. He kept on giving the food to the disciples to share with the people. ||| Tsh g Jesus am ha ui hegam hetasp pahn ch gohk waptopi k ab i nea dahm kahchim wui k ab hoꞌigeꞌel g Jiosh k am hahawa hahain k ab ha mah g e‑chuhchai. Tsh idam ab i ha mahkhi g hemajkam.
<sax> Everybody ate until they were full, and then twelve baskets of leftovers were collected. ||| Tsh wehsijj e gegosid k kokwod. Tsh g chuhchaij an i uꞌihi g ha wihpiꞌidag g hemajkam ahim matsh wo shuhshud g gamai gohk hoha.
<sax> At another time, when Jesus was praying in private with just his disciples with him, he asked them, “All these crowds of people—who do they say I am?” ||| Sh am hu hebai am hejelko e hoꞌigeꞌidahun g Jesus. Tsh am wui dada g chuhchaij. Kutsh am haꞌasa e hoꞌigeꞌidahun k hab kaij, “Dohꞌo ni‑elid g hemajkam?”
<sax> Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell anybody about this. ||| Sh hab kaij, “Dani ahni. Kumt wabshaba pi hedai wo shaꞌi ahgi hemu mani hedai wud.
<sax> “The Son of man must experience terrible sufferings,” he said. “He will be rejected by the elders, the chief priests, and the religious teachers. He will be killed, but on the third day he will rise again.” ||| Wehpeg at hemho wo wa ni‑bei g geꞌeged ch uꞌugchu papal ch chehanig em‑mashchamdam ahni Jiosh si Kehsha k muꞌi wo ni‑shoꞌigchud k am wo i ni‑dagito mant wo ni‑muhkid.

<sax> “If any one of you wants to follow me, you must deny yourself, pick up your cross daily, and follow me,” Jesus told all of them. ||| Sh hab hahawa ep kaij ab wehsijj ha wui, “Mamtp am wo s‑oidam g ni‑himdag k hemho wa gam hu wo dagito g hejel e‑tatchui k ahni ni‑tatchui hab wo junihid ni‑wehhejed e shoꞌigchudch.

<sax> About eight days later, after he had told them this, Jesus took Peter, John, and James with him and went up a mountain to pray. ||| Sh am hu d i hemako domig amjed mash hab kaij ihda. Kutsh g Jesus gan hu wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahu uhgk doꞌag t ab k ab i ha wai hegam Peter ch John ch James matsh gan hu wehmaj wo i chehchsh.
<sax> They spoke about his death, which would soon happen in Jerusalem. ||| Kush g Jiosh gewkdag ab ha ab e chehgid hab masma mo g tonlig. Sh idam am wehmaj aꞌaga g Jesus matsh pi shaꞌi tash amjed am hab wo e juh hegai matsh haschu g Jiosh am apꞌech matsh wo muh am Jerusalem t am.
<sax> Peter and the others were asleep. When they woke up they saw Jesus in his glory, and the two men standing next to him. ||| Sh eda hegam Peter shaꞌi si gewpkog ch s‑kohksim ch wabshaba ab si i nehnea k nei g Jesus ch hegam gohk oꞌodham mash am wehmaj gegok.
<sax> As the two men were about to leave, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it's great to be here. Let's make some shelters: one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.” He really didn't know what he was saying. ||| Tsh gam hu wo hihi hegam gohk. Tsh g Peter wabsh kohsh k daꞌiwuni k hab kaij, “T‑mashchamdam, s‑apꞌe oki mach ia haꞌichug. Tt ia waik hab wo em‑juni g al chechopi matt hekaj ab wo si has em‑el ahpi ch Mosesbad ch Elijabad.”
<sax> While he was speaking a cloud came and spread over them. They were terrified as they entered the cloud. ||| Tsh g chewagi ab i wuhsh mash eda wabsh kia neok g Peter k ab ehka ha dahm. Kutsh si s‑ehbeni hegam Peter matsh ab i hud g chewagi.
<sax> A voice spoke from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, the Chosen One. Listen to him!” ||| Tsh g Jiosh neꞌoki ab kaida chewagi t amjed k hab kaij, “Jesus o d si ni‑tatchuidch ni‑alidag. Heg amt ab wo si kaihamad.”
<sax> When the voice finished speaking, Jesus was there alone. They kept this to themselves, and didn't tell anyone at that time what they'd seen. ||| Sh am hahawa hejel kehk g Jesus. Kush pi am hu haꞌichug hegam gohk.
<sax> The next day, when they had come down the mountain, a huge crowd was waiting to meet Jesus. ||| Sh am baꞌich d i tash. Tsh ab hahawa i huhud doꞌag t amjed. Kush shaꞌi muꞌi hemajkam am nenida g Jesus ch ab nam.
<sax> A man in the crowd called out, “Teacher, please look at my son. He's my only child. ||| Kush hema si s‑kaidam neok ch hab kaij, “Ha mashchamdam, id o d waꞌi ni‑alidag m ia kehk.
<sax> “What an unbelieving and corrupt people you are! How long do I have to remain here with you, and put up with you?” said Jesus. “Bring your son here.” ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus ab ha wui g e‑chuhchai, “Shoꞌo waꞌi pi geꞌej g em‑wohochudadag.

<sax> Even as the boy came over, the demon sent him into convulsions, throwing him to the ground. But Jesus intervened, rebuking the evil spirit and healing the boy, and then gave him back to his father. ||| Sh ab chum him g ali. Sh haha wabsh ep i wua hegai jiawul am jewedo. Kush am si banimmed. Tsh g Jesus ab si s‑kehꞌel g jiawul k i wuhshad k am hahawa bei g al k ab i wanim ohgaj wui.
<sax> Everyone was amazed at this demonstration of God's power. However even though everyone was amazed by all he did, Jesus warned his disciples, ||| Kutsh wehsijj si e totods g hemajkam mat g Jiosh hab masma am i chehgi g e‑gewkdag k ab si has elid wehs hegai mo g Jesus hab junihim.
<sax> “Listen carefully to what I'm telling you: the Son of man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.” ||| “Am g wo s‑chegitok ihda mant am wo em‑ahgi. E o aihim mat g s‑ni‑kehꞌiddam an wo ni‑bei ahni Jiosh si Kehsha k am wo ni‑gagda ha wui g hahaꞌichu.”
<sax> But they didn't understand what this meant. Its meaning was hidden from them so they didn't realize its implications, and they were afraid to ask him about it. ||| Kush pi shaꞌi amichud mas haschu hab ahg ch wabshaba s‑ehbid mas ab wo kakke.
<sax> Then an argument started among the disciples about which of them was the greatest. ||| Sh am hu hebai am e neꞌowin hegam Jesus chuhchai mas hedai d wo si haꞌichuk.
<sax> But Jesus, knowing what they were arguing about, picked up and placed a small child next to him. ||| Kush g Jesus s‑ha amichud mo haschu am chegito ch heg hekaj g al ali ab i kei e‑hugid an
<sax> Then he said to them, “Anyone who accepts this little child in my name accepts me, and anyone who accepts me accepts the One who sent me. Whoever is least among you all is the greatest.” ||| k ash hab kaij ab ha wui, “Hegai mat hedai am ni‑wehhejed s‑ap ab wo neidad g al ali ch hab waꞌap s‑ap ab ni‑neid.

<sax> As the time approached for him to ascend to heaven, Jesus was determined to go to Jerusalem. ||| Kush s‑mahch g Jesus mo e aihim mat g Jiosh am wo uhpam i bei e‑kihdag wui ch heg hekaj am i e shelch mat am wo hih Jerusalem wui k am wo i e nako.
<sax> He sent messengers on ahead to a Samaritan village to get things ready for him. ||| Sh am hihimad ch am hema miabid g kihhim Samaria chekshani ch ed. Kutsh g Jesus am haꞌi ha cheha g e‑chuhchai matsh ha baꞌich wo hihim k wo bei g koksikud ch haꞌichu hugi. Kutsh idam ha e juh.
<sax> But the people would not welcome him because he was determined to press on to Jerusalem. ||| Tsh wabshaba am i s‑mai hegam hemajkam mash d gam hu himdam g Jesus Jerusalem wui k heg hekaj pi hohhoꞌi mat am wo jiwia nash pi pi ha hohhoꞌid g Jerusalem t am hemajkam.
<sax> When James and John saw this, they asked Jesus, “Master, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to burn them up?” ||| Kutsh hekid g James ch John am i s‑mai mo pi hohhoꞌid k hab kaij, “T‑kownalig, nap tatchua matt ab wo i tai g Jiosh. T ab wo i huduni g mei k wo ha kokda?”

<sax> Then they proceeded to another village. ||| Tsh amjed gam hu hahawa hihi hema ep kihhim wui.

<sax> Jesus told the man, “Foxes have their dens, and wild birds have their nests, but the Son of man doesn't even have a place to rest his head.” ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Napt hig wo e nako?

<sax> After this, the Lord appointed seventy other disciples, and sent them in pairs to every town and place that he planned to visit. ||| Tsh amjed g Jesus am haꞌi ep i ha chuhcha wewaꞌakko gamai gohk matsh goꞌogok e wehm wo ahgahi g haꞌichu ahgaj am ha oidch hegam kihhim matsh hebai apꞌech matsh am epai wo hih.
<sax> “The harvest is large, but the number of workers is small,” he told them. “Pray to the Lord of the harvest to send workers to his harvest fields. ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Neh, muꞌij o hegam mo e nahtokch mat wo e doꞌibia.

<sax> If there's a peaceful person living there, then your peace will rest on them; if not, it will return to you.

<sax> At that moment Jesus was filled with the joy of the Holy Spirit, and said, “I thank you Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for you hid these things from the wise and clever people and revealed them to children! Yes, Father, you were pleased to do it in this way. ||| Kutsh iaꞌi idani g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ab mah g Jesus g si geꞌe s‑hehgig.

<sax> Once an expert in religious law stood up and tried to trap Jesus. “Teacher,” he asked, “What do I have to do to gain eternal life?” ||| Tsh am hu hebai am hema jiwia g chehanig ha mashchamdam k wabsh chum heki s‑himchudam g Jesus hab kaijch, “Ha mashchamdam, shahnt wo ni‑juh.

<sax> “What is written in the law? How do you read it?” asked Jesus. ||| Kush hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Nap hig pi mahch mo has chuꞌig an Jiosh oꞌohana ed heg amjed.”
<sax> “You shall love the Lord your God with your whole heart, and your whole spirit, and your whole strength, and your whole mind; and love your neighbor as yourself,” the man replied. ||| Sh hab kaij hegai oꞌodham, “Heuꞌu. Bo chuꞌig:
<sax> “You're right,” Jesus told him. “Do this, and you will live.” ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “Heg o wud. Kut s‑ap ab wo i m‑wahki maptp heg am hab wo junihid.”
<sax> It so happened that a priest was going the same way. He saw the man, but he passed by on the other side of the road. ||| K am woꞌo.
<sax> Then a Levite came along. But when he got to the place and saw the man, he also passed by on the other side. ||| T hab wa masma g papal ha wehm chikpandam ab hema him k am nei hegai oꞌodham mo am woꞌo k gam hu wabsh bijim k gam hu hih.
<sax> Finally a Samaritan man came along. As he passed by, he saw the man and felt sorry for him. ||| T g hema Samaria t am oꞌodham am hahawa him k cheh ihda oꞌodham. Kum ab aꞌai s‑e kehꞌid g Samaria t am hemajkam ha wehm. T eda ihda si s‑hoꞌigeꞌid
<sax> He went over and treated the man's wounds with oil and wine, and bandaged them. Then he placed the man on his own donkey and took him to an inn where he took care of him. ||| k ab i wako g ehꞌed g nawaitkaj k ab i huhud k an i hobino g ikuskaj k an hahawa dai e‑shoiga an k gam hu i bei kihhim wui mat am hebai wo ha nuhkudach.
<sax> The next day he gave two denarii to the innkeeper and told him, ‘Take care of him, and if you spend more than this, I'll pay you back when I return.’ ||| “K am baꞌich d i tash.

<sax> Which one of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who was attacked by robbers?” ||| “Neh, kup hedai hab elid idam waik mo s‑ap d nawojij hegai mamt gewichkwua?”
<sax> “The one who showed him kindness,” the man replied. ||| Sh hab kaij hegai chehanig ha mashchamdam, “Hegai mo s‑hoꞌigeꞌid.”
<sax> While they were on their way, Jesus arrived at a village, and a woman called Martha invited him to her home. ||| Sh amjed am hebai hihim idam Jesus ch am dada hema kihhim t am. Sh am hema g uwi hab chehgig Marda ch ab i ha wahpki e‑kih ed.
<sax> “Martha, Martha,” the Lord replied, “you're worried and upset about all this. ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Ih, Marda, muꞌi ap haꞌichukaj e kudut.
<sax> But only one thing is really necessary. Mary has chosen the right thing, and it shall not be taken away from her.” ||| K eda am d waꞌi hemako haꞌichu mo d si haꞌichu. Id at g Mary ab bei. Kut pi wo shaꞌi e wohppoꞌidach.”
<sax> Once Jesus was praying in a certain place. When he finished, one of his disciples asked him, “Lord, please teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples.” ||| Sh am hu hebai e hoꞌigeꞌidahun g Jesus ch am i kuhgit.

<sax> Jesus told them, “When you pray, say, ‘Father, let your name be honored as holy. May your kingdom come. ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Id amt hab wo chei am e hoꞌigeꞌidahunch:
<sax> Jesus went on to tell them, “Say you have a friend and you go to him in the middle of the night and ask, ‘My friend, lend me three loaves of bread  because a friend of mine has come to visit me, and I don't have any food to give him.’ ||| Sh hab ep kaij g Jesus ab ha wui hegam mo ab si wecho e mashcham, “Neh, tp hems hema pi am hu geꞌe wo haꞌichu hugik.

<sax> I tell you, even though he refuses to get up and give you anything, despite you being his friend, if you are persistent, your friend will get up and give you everything you need. ||| “T wabshaba pi has wo e elid k ab wabsh wo kia tahnid. T am haha wo i wamig k ab wo mah nat pi pi haꞌasa ab wo tahnid.
<sax> I tell you: ask, and you shall receive; seek, and you shall find; knock, and the door shall be opened to you.  For everyone who asks, receives; and everyone who seeks, finds; and to everyone who knocks the door will be opened. ||| “Pegih, mt ahpim hab wa masma pi haꞌasa ab wo tahnid g Jiosh mam haschu i tatchua. T ab wo em‑mah. Am g wo haꞌichu i e gahgidad. T wo em‑chehgi. Ab g wo shontpag g kihjeg. T ab wo i e kuhpiꞌo em‑wehhejed.
<sax> So if you, even though you are evil, still know to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him?” ||| Mam has i masma pi apꞌe ch wabshaba s‑mahch mamt g s‑kehg haꞌichu ab wo ha mah g e‑aꞌaliga.

<sax> Jesus was driving out a demon that had made a man dumb. When the demon had left, the man who was dumb spoke, and the crowds were amazed. ||| Sh am hu hebai hema pi ha neok g cheoj nash pi g jiawul an uꞌukch. Kutsh g Jesus gam hu hab i juh g jiawul.

<sax> However, if I am driving out demons by the power of God, then this proves God's kingdom has arrived. It's right here among you! ||| Jiosh gewkdagkaj ani gam hu hab i ha wua g jijawul. K id am wohokamchud mat heki hu in i wuhsh g Jiosh kownaltalig em‑shahgid.

<sax> When an evil spirit leaves someone, it goes through the desert looking for a place to stay. When it doesn't find anywhere, it says, ‘I'll return to the house I left.’ ||| Kush hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Matp hems g jiawul an wo hema uꞌukch g oꞌodham ch wabsh wo dagito mat am hebai ep wo e ul.

<sax> As people crowded around him, Jesus began telling them, “This is an evil generation for it's looking for some miraculous sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. ||| Sh am i muꞌidahim g hemajkam. Kush hab kaij g Jesus, “Muꞌijj o g ha‑chegitoidag pi apꞌe. K heg hekaj s‑neidamk mant hab wo juh g s‑hasig haꞌichu k am wo wohokamch mani ab Jiosh amjed.

<sax> Your eye is the light for your body. When your eye is good, your whole body is full of light. But when your eye is bad, your body is in the dark. ||| “Em‑wuhpui at s‑ap am wo i wahki g tonlig matp wo s‑mamsk k wabshaba pi am hu wo i wahki matp pi wo mamsk. Kum heg hekaj s‑ap ha nuhkud.

<sax> After Jesus had finished speaking, a Pharisee invited him to come and eat with him. So Jesus went and sat down to a meal. ||| Tsh am i haꞌasa neo g Jesus. Tsh am hema jiwia g Palasi k am waid mat wo wehmaj e gegos. Kutsh wa woho am i wahk k am i dahiwua matsh wo e gegos.
<sax> The Pharisee was surprised that Jesus didn't wash his hands before eating as ceremonially required. ||| Tsh hegai Palasi si has i el neidok mat pi e wako hab masma mo d ha himdag.

<sax> Shame on you! You build memorial tombs to honor the prophets, but it was your own fathers who killed them in the first place!  By doing this you are witnesses showing that you agree with what your fathers did. They killed the prophets, and you build their tombs! ||| “Em‑shohshon at muꞌi ha kokda g Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam. Kum ahpim ha wepo masma, chum ams ha hehosid g ha‑hihaꞌiniga hegam mamt ha kokda.

<sax> Then Jesus spoke to the crowds. “When you see a cloud rising in the west, you immediately say, ‘a rain-shower's coming,’ and it happens.  When a south wind blows, you say ‘it's going to be hot,’ and it is.  You hypocrites, how is it that you know how to rightly interpret the weather but you don't know how to interpret the present time? ||| Sh hab hahawa ep kaij g Jesus, “Neh, mt wo s‑mahchk mas wo juh o as wo tonih am neidk mas hebaijed hewed ch has mahs chewagi i wushke.

<sax> One Sabbath Jesus was teaching in a synagogue, ||| Sh am hu hebai mihshmda tash ch ed g Jesus am ha mashcham cheopi ch ed.

<sax> But they all started to make excuses. The first said, ‘I've just bought a field and I have to go and see it. Please excuse me.’ ||| “K wabshaba idam am ahgid mat pi wo e nako mat am wo hihi.
<sax> Another said, ‘I've just bought five pairs of oxen and have to go and try them out. Please excuse me.’ Still another said, ||| “Kutp hems hema am wo ahgi, ‘Wehst‑mahm woiwis ant am ha nolawt k hegam s‑ha aꞌappemimk.’
<sax> Then the servant said, ‘Master, I did what you told me, but there are still empty places.’ ||| “Kut wa woho hab juh k am hahawa jiwia k hab kaij, ‘Bant juh g m‑chehanig. K wabshaba am wabsh kia wiꞌis g kih.’
<sax> So the master told the servant, ‘Go out on the country roads and lanes, and make people come—I want my house to be full. ||| “K hab ep kaij g ahmoj, ‘Am g i wuhshani k an mehk hihm chuꞌuchum wopog oidch an shaꞌi ch ed k hab wo ha juh mat ab wo i hihi mat wo shuhd g ni‑kih.

<sax> A large crowd was accompanying Jesus. He turned to them and said, ||| Sh am hu hebai hihim hegam Jesus. Sh muꞌi hemajkam am ha wehm hihim.
<sax> “If you want to follow me but you don't hate your father and mother, and wife and children, and brothers and sisters—even your own life—you can't be my disciple. ||| “Pi am ab hu shaꞌi ni‑tatchua mamtp pi baꞌich ab wo i ni‑tatchua mam hi g e‑jehj ch e‑wepnag ch e‑wehm kihkam ch e‑aꞌaliga.

<sax> Once there was a man who had two sons,” Jesus explained. ||| Sh hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Matp hems hema g oꞌodham gohk wihpiopga.
<sax> “The younger one told his father, ‘Father, give me my inheritance now.’ So the man divided his property between them. ||| T g chumchu ab wui i him k hab kaij, ‘Ni‑ohg, wapt wo i ni‑mah hegai mat d wo chum ni‑wuikamk.’ Kut wa woho am i gawulkai g e‑eniga k ab ha mah g e‑wihpiopga hegai mo haschu d ha‑wuikam.
<sax> A few days later the younger son packed up what he had and left for a distant country. Here he wasted all his money living a reckless life. ||| “T ihda chumchu am ha hekaj gagda g e‑eniga k bei g namkigaj k gam hu simnolt mehk jewed wui k am heki wua g e‑lialiga am hab wuadch g pi apꞌekam.

<sax> When he came to his senses, he said to himself, ‘All of my father's workers have more than enough to eat—why am I dying from hunger here? ||| “T am hahawa haꞌichu kop moꞌoj ed. K hab e ahg, Wehs g ni‑ohg pionag o s‑edgid g haꞌichu hugi. Kuni eda ahni d bihugimkam.

<sax> But the father told his servants, ‘Quick—bring the best robe and put it on him. Put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet. ||| “T wabshaba g ohgaj hab wabsh ha ah g e‑pionag, ‘Ab g wo i bek g s‑kehg eniga k an wo wahkid k g anilo an wo shaꞌich nowij an k g shuhshk ab ep wo cheka

<sax> He told his father, ‘Look, all these years I've served you, and never disobeyed you, but you never once gave me even a young goat so I could have a party with my friends. ||| K wabshaba ab wui hab kaij, ‘Nehꞌe, haꞌakia aꞌahidag ani ab m‑wecho ch chum hekid hab wua g m‑tatchui.

<sax> Jesus told his disciples this story. “There was once a rich man whose manager was accused of wasting what belonged to his master. ||| Sh am ep ha ahgid g Jesus ihda wepogida ahga ch hab kaij, “Tp hems am hu hebai hema d wo s‑kais oꞌodhamk. K hegai mat am i kei mo d maliom wabsh heki wua g lialigaj.
<sax> So the rich man called in his manager, and asked him, ‘What's this I hear about you?

<sax> So he invited all those who were in debt to his master to come and see him. He asked the first one, ‘How much do you owe my master?’ ||| Bo kaij ch am hahawa hehemako ha waid hegam mo ab ab e wulshch g ahmoj. Kut am hema jiwia.

<sax> Then he said to another, ‘How much do you owe?’ The man replied, ‘A hundred units of wheat.’ He said to him, ‘Take your bill and change it to eighty.’ ||| “K g maliom ab wui hab kaij, ‘Nap s‑mahch map heꞌekia ab ab i e wulshch g t‑ahmo?’
<sax> The rich man commended his dishonest manager for his cunning idea. The children of this world are more cunning towards one another than are the children of light. ||| “Neh, t g ahmoj si has i el am i kahk mat has e juh ihda s‑chu banmadamkam maliom nat pi si s‑e mahch k hab e juh. Neh, hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh o em‑baꞌich i s‑e mahch ch hab wua haꞌichu.
<sax> I tell you, use the wealth of this world to make friends for yourselves so that when it's gone, you'll be welcomed into an eternal home. ||| “Id ani em‑ahgid mamt wo s‑ap hekaj g e‑kaisdag am ha wehhejed hegam mo tatchua g i wehmtadag.

<sax> If you can be trusted with very little you can also be trusted with much; if you are dishonest with very little you will also be dishonest with much. ||| “Hegai matp hedai s‑ap wo nuhkud g al chuꞌuchum haꞌichu at hab waꞌap s‑ap wo nuhkud g geꞌeged haꞌichu.

<sax> Once there was a man who was rich. He wore purple clothes and fine linen, and enjoyed a luxurious life. ||| Sh id am ep ha ahgid g Jesus:
<sax> A beggar named Lazarus used to sit at his gate, covered in sores, ||| K am hema d si shoꞌigkam oꞌodham ch hab chehgig Lazarus ch wehsko hihiwog. Kum ab i bebhe ch ab dadsha s‑kais oꞌodham kihjego.

<sax> “Teacher,” they began, “Moses gave us a law that if a married man dies leaving a wife without children, then his brother should marry the widow and have children for his dead brother. ||| “Ha mashchamdam, an o hab chuꞌig ihda chehanigaj g Jiosh Mosesbad oꞌohana ed ch hab chuꞌig matsh g oidchkam wehngaj hegai mat wo muh pi ha aꞌaligak hemho wo wa bei g hohnigaj g e‑wehnagbad.

<sax> Finally the wife died too. ||| T gam hu si ha oidk heg ep muh uwi.

<sax> “Here in this age people marry and are given in marriage,” Jesus explained. ||| Sh g Jesus hab kaij ab ha wui, “Ia o waꞌi e hohont g hemajkam jewed dahm.
<sax> “But those who are considered worthy to share in the age to come and the resurrection from the dead don't marry or are given in marriage.  They can't die any longer; they're like the angels and are children of God since they're children of the resurrection. ||| K wabshaba pi hab chuꞌig an Jiosh kihdag ed.

<sax> But on the question of whether the dead are raised, even Moses proved this when he wrote about the burning bush, when he calls the Lord, ‘the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.’ ||| Mosesbad atki wa an oꞌoha mash wa g Jiosh am e chehgid wui heg hekaj shaꞌi mash meihid ch pi meitto.

<sax> After this no one dared to ask him any more questions. ||| Tsh amjed pi hedai e nako mas ab haꞌichu ep wo kakke.
<sax> While everyone was paying attention, he said to his disciples, ||| Kush wehsijj ab si kaiham g Jesus hegam muꞌi hemajkam. Kush ab ha ahgid g e‑chuhchai ch hab kaij,
<sax> “Watch out for religious leaders who like to go around in long robes, and love to be greeted with respect in the markets, and to have the best seats in the synagogues and places of honor at banquets. ||| “Hegam mo d chum chehanig em‑mashchamdam o am si s‑apko dadhaiwup cheopi ch ed ch geꞌe gegosig ch ed.

<sax> All of them gave from their wealth what they had, but she gave from her poverty all she had to live on.” ||| Hegam o ab wabsh mahk hegai mo haschu i pi tatchua no pi wabsh s‑lialiga. T wabshaba ihda al oks wehs mah mo haschu al i edgid mat hekaj wo chum kihdagk.”
<sax> Some of those there were talking about the Temple, its fine stonework and the beautiful gifts that had been donated. But Jesus said, ||| Kush am haꞌi neneok ab amjed g geꞌe cheopi ch am aꞌaga mo si s‑kehg hab mahs ch si s‑kehg hohodaikaj hab junis ch si s‑kehg mahkigdagkaj e heosid.
<sax> “Make sure you're not deceived,” Jesus warned them. “Many people will come claiming to be me, saying, ‘Here I am!’ and, ‘The time has come!’ but don't follow them. ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “Mt wo s‑e nenꞌoidad ch pi am hu wo e iattogi.

<sax> But this will provide you an opportunity to speak on my behalf before them. ||| Id at am wo em‑apꞌet mamt am wo ah g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh.

<sax> There will be signs in the sun, moon, and stars, and on the earth the nations will be in distress, confused by the sea's rolling and crashing.

<sax> Satan entered into Judas, surnamed Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples. ||| Kutsh g ge Jiawul Satan an bei g Judas Iscariot.

<sax> At the same time they also got into a quarrel about which of them was the most important. ||| Kush am e neꞌowin hegam Jesus chuhchai am aꞌagadch mas hedai d wo si haꞌichuk am ha shahgid.
<sax> Jesus told them, “Foreign kings lord it over their subjects, and those having power even want people to call them ‘benefactors.’  But it should not be so with you!

<sax> They all asked, “So are you the son of God?” ||| Kush wehsijj hab kaij, “A kuptp d Jiosh alidag?”

<sax> “Are you the King of the Jews?” Pilate asked him. ||| Kush ab kakke g Pilate g Jesus ch hab kaij, “Nap d ha‑kownalig g Tutuligo hemajkam?”
<sax> Then Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, “I don't find this man guilty of any crime.” ||| Tsh g Pilate am i mamche hegai mam ab abchud.

<sax> When he discovered that Jesus came under Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod who was also in Jerusalem at the time. ||| Kumsh am ahgid mash am haꞌab d kihkam.

<sax> Herod was very pleased to see Jesus since he had wanted to meet him for a long time. He had heard about Jesus and was hoping to see him perform a miracle. ||| Kush si s‑hehgig g Herod nash pi tash waꞌi chum s‑neidamk hab chum e ahgch matp hems am tahgio hab wo juh g s‑hasig haꞌichu.
<sax> He asked Jesus many questions, but Jesus did not answer him at all. ||| Kumtsh am kei tahgio. Kush muꞌi haꞌichu kakke. Sh wabshaba pi has shaꞌi kaij g Jesus.
<sax> The chief priests and religious teachers stood there, angrily accusing him. ||| Kush g uꞌugchu papal ch chehanig ha mashchamdam am gegok ch si s‑gewkam ab haꞌichu abchud g Jesus.
<sax> Pilate called together the chief priests, rulers, and the people, ||| Tsh g Pilate am i ha hemapai g uꞌugchu papal ch ha wanimeddam g hemajkam
<sax> and told them, “You brought this man before me, accusing him of inciting the people to rebellion.

<sax> (Barabbas had been put in prison for taking part in a rebellion in the city, and for murder.). ||| Sh eda ihda Barabbas am e kuhpch nash pi chum haꞌi ha wehm cheggia g kownal ch haꞌi ha kokda.
<sax> Pilate wanted to release Jesus, so spoke to them again. ||| Sh am ep chum ha wehm neok g Pilate nash pi chum s‑dagitoimk g jesus.

<sax> and Pilate gave the sentence they demanded. ||| Tsh am i apꞌech mat am hab wo e juh g ha‑tatchui.

<sax> As the soldiers  led him away, they seized a man called Simon of Cyrene, who had come in from the countryside. They put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus. ||| Kumtsh gam hu i bei g Jesus ab kushwiotachudk g kots. Kush am hu hebai hihim.

<sax> A large crowd followed him, along with women who were mourning and lamenting him. ||| Kush muꞌi hemajkam ab oidch hihim. Sh g uꞌuwi si shoanihim wehhejed.

<sax> Jesus said, “Father, please forgive them, for they don't know what they're doing.” They divided up his clothes by throwing dice for them. ||| Tsh ab hahawa e hoꞌigeꞌidahu g Jesus k hab kaij, “Ni‑ohg Jiosh, ab g wabsh si i s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌid hegam mat ab ni‑naggia. Pi o shaꞌi mahch mani d si m‑Kehsha ch d s‑apꞌekam.”
<sax> The people stood and watched and the leaders sneered at Jesus. “He saved others, let him save himself, if he is really God's Messiah, the Chosen One,” they said. ||| Sh g hemajkam am gegok ch neid wehs ihda. Sh g ha wanimeddam nahnko ahg g Jesus ch hab kaij, “Ha at doꞌibia haꞌi, pegih, k hejel wo e doꞌibia matp d Jiosh si Kehsha.”
<sax> The soldiers also mocked him, coming up to him and offering him wine vinegar, saying, ||| Kush g shondal hab waꞌap nahnko wua ch hab wabsh s‑junim k ab chum mah g nawait
<sax> “If you're the King of the Jews, then save yourself.” ||| ch wabsh nahnko ahg hab kaijch, “Oi g hejel e doꞌibiad napsh pi d ge kownal.”
<sax> Above Jesus was a sign on which it was written, “This is the King of the Jews.” ||| Sh am dahm oꞌohadag ihda, “Id o d Tutuligo hemajkam ha‑kownalig.”
<sax> One of the criminals hanging there joined in the insults against Jesus. “Aren't you the Messiah?” he asked. “Then save yourself—and us too!” ||| Kush hema hegam pi ap hehemajkam mash ab hab waꞌap naggia kots t ab ab si s‑koꞌokam has ahg g Jesus ch hab kaij, “Neh, kuptp d ge Jiosh si Kehsha, pegih, k wo hejel e doꞌibia k ahchim ep wo t‑doꞌibia.”
<sax> But the other criminal disagreed and argued with him, “Don't you fear God even when you're suffering the same punishment?” he asked. ||| Kush g hema ab si s‑kehꞌid ihda ch hab kaij, “Aha nap pi ehbid g Jiosh. Ia ach t‑wehm nahngia ch ab t‑wepo mohtoꞌidas g chuꞌijig.
<sax> “For us the sentence is right since we're being punished for what we did, but this man didn't do anything wrong.” ||| Kuch ahchim s‑ap ab mohtoꞌidas nach pi wa woho d pi ap chuꞌijkam. Kutsh eda ihda pi hab shaꞌi juh g pi apꞌekam.”
<sax> By this time it was around noon and darkness fell over the whole land until three in the afternoon. ||| Kutsh am i dahm juh. Tsh muh g tash k wehsko s‑chuhugam ch ab ai g waik ohla.
<sax> The sun's light was shut out, and the Temple veil was torn in two. ||| Kutsh am geꞌe cheopi ch ed g s‑kowk ikus kuhpadag ab si shel e wantsh.
<sax> Jesus called out in a loud voice, “Father, I place myself in your hands.” Having said this he breathed his last. ||| Kush am si s‑kaidam e hoꞌigeꞌidahun g Jesus Jiosh wui ch hab kaij, “Ni‑ohg, ab ant i m‑mah g ni‑doakag.” Neh, bash cheꞌiok am i muh.
<sax> When the centurion saw what had happened he praised God and said, “Surely this man was innocent.” ||| Kutsh am i nei g shondal ha‑geꞌejig matsh haschu has e juh k ab si ihm g Jiosh ch hab kaij, “Woho oki d s‑apꞌekam oꞌodham ihda.”

<sax> But all those who knew Jesus, including the women who'd followed him from Galilee, watched from a distance. ||| Kush wehsijj hegam mo si s‑mahch g Jesus ga hu wabsh mehk gegok ch ab neid wehs ihda. Haꞌi idam ash d hegam uꞌuwi mash ga hu Galilee t amjed an wehmajkahim g Jesus.
<sax> There was a man called Joseph who was good and honest. He was a member of the council,  but he hadn't agreed with its decisions and actions. He came from the Jewish town of Arimathea, and was waiting expectantly for the kingdom of God. ||| Sh eda wa hema hegam e jehnigiddam chum pi hohhoꞌid matsh g wehmaj e jehnigiddam s‑muꞌam k ah g Jesus. Id ash hab chehgig Joseph ch ab d kihkam mash am d Arimathea ch s‑ap d oꞌodham ch ab nenida g Jiosh kownaltalig.
<sax> Joseph went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. ||| Tsh hekid am i muh g Jesus, tsh ha hekaj am wui hih g Pilate k ab si e shoꞌigchud k tahni g honshpadaj. Tsh am wa apꞌech matsh wo bei.
<sax> They returned home and prepared spices and ointments. But on the Sabbath they rested, observing the commandment. ||| Kutsh gam hu uhpam hihi idam uꞌuwi mash hebai dadha k am i apꞌech haꞌichu mat hekaj wo s‑ap hab juh mo hab masma hab ha wua g e‑koꞌidag k ash am hahawa e ulinihogi mihshmda tash ch ed mo hab masma d ha‑chehanig.
<sax> Very early on the first day of the week, the women went to the tomb, taking the spices they'd prepared. ||| Sh am e aihim g domig tash. Tsh am hihi idam uꞌuwi hihaꞌini wui k ash uꞌa hegai matsh am nahto matsh hekaj wo i apꞌech g muhki.
<sax> They found that the stone had been rolled away from the entrance to the tomb, ||| Kush gam hu e melchudas hegai geꞌe hodai mash ab hekaj e kuhpch g hihaꞌini.
<sax> but when they went in they didn't find the body of the Lord Jesus. ||| Tsh am i wahp k pi shaꞌi edagi g muhki
<sax> While they were wondering what was going on, two men suddenly appeared dressed in clothes that shone brilliantly. ||| k am wabsh i gegok pi amichudch ihda. Tsh am haha wabsh gohk i e chehgi ha wui mo hab sha mahs mo g oꞌodham. Kush wabsh si tonod g haꞌichu ha‑eniga.
<sax> The women were terrified and bowed down, their faces on the ground. ||| Kutsh si e totods idam uꞌuwi k ab si i shul jewedo.
<sax> He's not here; he's risen from the dead! Remember what he told you while you were still in Galilee: ||| Pi o ia hu haꞌichug g Jesus nat pi i wuhsh ab muhkig amjed. Am g wo i chegito mo wa has kaij ab em‑wui. Am am wa wabsh kia haꞌichug Galilee t am.
<sax> ‘The Son of man must be betrayed into the hands of evil men, be crucified, and on the third day rise again.’ ” ||| K wa hab kaij, ‘Hemho ant am wo wa i ni‑dagito pi apꞌekam hemajkam ha wui ahni Jiosh si Kehsha.

<sax> Those who told the apostles what had happened were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and other women with them. ||| Haꞌi idam uꞌuwi mash am ha ahgid ash d Mary Magdalene ch Joanna ch hegai Mary mash g madaj hab chehgig James.
<sax> But it seemed like nonsense to them, so they didn't believe the women. ||| Kush hegam Jesus chuhchai pi ab hu ha wohochud nash pi hab ha elid mo wabsh pi e mahch ch hab kaij.
<sax> However Peter got up and ran to the tomb. Bending down, he looked in and saw only the linen grave-clothes. So he went back home, wondering what had happened. ||| Tsh wabshaba g Peter am i e nakog k am meh hihaꞌini wui k ged hu meliw k am i koachsh.

<sax> The same day two disciples were on their way to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem. ||| Kush heg waꞌi tash gohkajj am hihim Emmaus kihhim wui. Id amt ab wo ai kihhim am hu i gohk ohla ab am hihimadch Jerusalem t amjed.
<sax> They were talking about all that had happened. ||| Sh idam am hihimad ch neneok ab amjed hegai matsh haschu has e juh am tahgio g Jesus.
<sax> As they discussed and debated, Jesus came up and fell into step with them. ||| Tsh g Jesus am ha aꞌa k am ha wehm hih.
<sax> But they were kept from recognizing him. ||| Kush hi wa chum neid ch wabsh pi amichud.
<sax> “What are you discussing as you walk along?” he asked them. They stopped, their faces sad. ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Shahchu am am si aꞌagad ch ia hihim?”
<sax> But our high priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death, and they crucified him. ||| Kut g uꞌugchu papal ch t‑wanimeddam am i dagito kownal wui mat wo mua. Kumt ab sisish kots t ab k mua.
<sax> We had hoped he was the one who was going to rescue Israel. It's been three days now since all this happened. ||| Kuch eda id hab chum si elid mo d hegai matsh wa wo t‑doꞌibia ahchim Tutuligo hemajkam. K hemuch d i waik tash amjed mat hab e juh.
<sax> But then some of the women in our group surprised us. ||| Kut am haꞌi hihi g uꞌuwi t‑wehm wohochuddam wabsh i siꞌalim
<sax> At dawn they went to the tomb and they didn't find his body. They came back saying that they'd seen a vision of angels who told them he's alive. ||| k atsh pi cheh g muhki k uhpam dada k t‑tods am t‑ahgidch matsh am haꞌi i e chehgi g anghil ha wui. Sh idam hab ha ahgid mo d doakam g Jesus.
<sax> Some of us went to the tomb, and found it just as the women said—but they didn't see him.” ||| T am haꞌi hihi g chechoj hihaꞌini wui k am s‑mai mash wa woho pi am hu haꞌichug g muhki mo hab chum kaij hegam uꞌuwi.”
<sax> Jesus told them, “You're so dull! How slow you are to trust in all that the prophets said! ||| Sh hab hahawa kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “S‑wohom am hig pi haꞌichu aꞌamichud ch pi wohochud hegai mo wa g kekelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam am ahg.
<sax> Didn't the Messiah have to suffer before he could enter into his glory?” ||| No hig pi hab wa mahs mat hab masma wo e shoꞌigch g Jiosh si Kehsha k am wo i wah si s‑kehg e‑apꞌedag ed.”
<sax> Then, starting with Moses and all the prophets, he explained to them everything that was said in Scripture about himself. ||| Neh, bash kaij g Jesus ch amjed am i wuhshad k am tashogi wehs hegai matki g Mosesbad ch wehs hegam kekelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam an oꞌoha ab amjed.
<sax> When he sat down to eat with them, he took the bread and gave thanks, broke it, and gave it to them. ||| Tsh am wo i gegos. Tsh am bei g chemait k am e hoꞌigeꞌidahun k am hahawa hahain k ab ha mah.
<sax> Their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. Then he disappeared from view. ||| Kutsh am hahawa i amich. Tsh wabshaba am wabsh i piꞌata.
<sax> The two disciples said to each other, “Weren't our thoughts on fire when he spoke to us, as he explained the Scriptures to us?” ||| Sh hab hahawa kaij ab aꞌai e wui, “Neh, ab at wa si i t‑shuhdad g s‑ap tahhadkam mo wa ab t‑wehm neokhim ch am tashogid g Jiosh oꞌohana mach ab hihim wohg oidch.”
<sax> They got up right away and returned to Jerusalem. There they found the eleven disciples and those who were with them meeting together, ||| Tsh am ha hekaj i e nakog k gam hu uhpam hihi Jerusalem wui. Kush am e hemapadch hegam gamai hemako Jesus chuhchai haꞌi ha wehm g e‑wehm wohochuddam. Tsh am dada idam gohk.

<sax> Then those who had just arrived explained to the other disciples what had happened to them on the road, and how they had recognized Jesus when he broke bread. ||| Kush idam gohk am hahawa epai ha ahgid matsh haschu has e juh am wohg ch ed ch heg ehp matsh amich g Jesus matsh am hahai g chemait.
<sax> While they were talking, Jesus himself stood among them, and said, “Peace to you!” ||| Sh am wabsh kia aꞌaga ihda. Sh am haha wabsh kehk ha shahgid g Jesus ch ash hab kaij ab ha wui, “Am g wo s‑ap e tahtkkad.”
<sax> They were startled and afraid, thinking they were seeing a ghost. ||| Kutsh shaꞌi si e totods hab em‑ahgch mo d wabsh kokꞌoi.
<sax> Having said this, he showed them his hands and feet. ||| Kush hab cheꞌiok ab ha chehgi g e‑nohnhoi ch e‑tahtad.
<sax> But they still couldn't believe it because they were so elated and amazed. He asked them, “Do you have anything to eat?” ||| Kush chum si s‑ap e tahtk ch wabshaba wabsh i hahaꞌadka natsh pi wabsh i pi mai mat has wo el. Kush heg hekaj ab ha kakke mas am haꞌichu chekch mat wo hu.
<sax> They gave him a piece of cooked fish, ||| Kutsh ab ge mah g watopi gaꞌi.
<sax> and he took it and ate it in front of them. ||| Kutsh ab be k huh. Sh id wehsijj neid.
<sax> Then Jesus said to them, “This is what I explained to you while I was still with you. Everything written about me in the law of Moses, the prophets, and the psalms, had to be fulfilled.” ||| Kush hab hahawa kaij ab ha wui, “Wehs ani am em‑ahgid ihda heki hu.

<sax> Then he opened their minds so they were able to understand the Scriptures. ||| Neh, bash kaij ch ab hahawa i ha mah g amichudadag mat wo s‑amich g Jiosh oꞌohana
<sax> He told them, “It was written like this: the Messiah would suffer and rise from the dead on the third day, and in his name ||| k ash hab kaij ab ha wui, “Bant masma hab ni‑juh mo wa hab chuꞌig an Jiosh oꞌohana ed mant hab wo wa ni‑juh.

<sax> repentance for the forgiveness of sins would be preached to all nations, beginning in Jerusalem. ||| Kut ia Jerusalem t amjed am aꞌai wo i e ahgahi gam hu wehsko jejewed ha dahm mat g hemajkam ab wo i ni‑hiwig k gm hu wo s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegitoi.

<sax> Then he led them out until they were near Bethany, and lifting up his hands, he blessed them. ||| Tsh am hahawa i ha wanim amai mash am miabidch g Bethany. Tsh am hu hebai i dada. Kutsh am uhgk ul g e‑nohnhoi ha dahm k ab ha hoꞌigeꞌelid,
<sax> While he was blessing them, he left them, and was taken up to heaven. ||| Tsh g Jiosh gam hu i bei dahm kahchim wui.
<sax> They worshiped him, and then they returned to Jerusalem full of joy. ||| Sh idam ab si has elid ch gam hu hahawa hihi Jerusalem wui s‑hehgigch
<sax> They spent all their time in the Temple praising God. ||| k amjed chum hekid am hihhim geꞌe cheopi wui ch ab hoꞌigeꞌelid g Jiosh.
<sax> This book is the record of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham, beginning with the family line: ||| Ia atsh mahsi g Jesus Christ jewed dahm k ab d amjedkamaj hegai t‑kekelibad ha‑kownalig mash hab chehgig David. Kush g Davidbad ab d amjedkamaj hegai mash d t‑shohshon ahchim Tutuligo ch hab chehgig Abraham.
<sax> Abraham was the father of Isaac; and Isaac the father of Jacob; and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers; ||| Abraham atsh wa an alidt g Isaac.
<sax> So all the generations from Abraham to David add up to fourteen; from David to the Babylonian exile, fourteen; and from the Babylonian exile to the Messiah, fourteen. ||| Pegih, nt gamai giꞌik an oꞌoha g ha‑chechgig hegam mo d e‑oꞌogbad am i amjed mash eda am oimmed g Abrahambad ch am hugkam mash eda am oimmed g Davidbad.

<sax> This is how the birth of Jesus the Messiah happened. His mother, Mary, was engaged to Joseph, but before they slept together she became pregnant by the Holy Spirit. ||| Ia ant wo oꞌoha matsh has e juh matsh eda mahsi g Jesus Christ. Am amtsh i apꞌech matsh idam Joseph ch Mary wo e hohont. Tsh am hahawa s‑e mai mat g ali wo bei.

<sax> Now this all happened to fulfill what the Lord said through the prophet: ||| Wehs atsh wa hab e juh ihda hab masma mash wa hab masma heki hu hab kaij g Jiosh. Kelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam atki an oꞌoha mash wa hab kaij:
<sax> Joseph woke up and did what the angel of the Lord told him to do. ||| Kutsh hekid am i nea g Joseph k atsh am ha hekaj hab e juh mash has i kaij g anghil ab wui matsh an bei g Mary.
<sax> Joseph married Mary, but did not sleep with her until after she had given birth to a son, whom he named Jesus. ||| Sh wabshaba pi am hu hab masma e wehm kih mo g e wehm kihkam am hugkam mat hekid ip bei g ali. Tsh g Joseph hab hahawa chehch Jesus.
<sax> After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea during the reign of King Herod, wise men came from the east to Jerusalem. ||| Jesus atsh am mahsi Bethlehem kihhim t am am Judea chekshani ch ed.

<sax> When King Herod heard about it, he was very disturbed, and the whole of Jerusalem with him. ||| Kutsh si e kudu g kownal am i kahk. Tsh heg hekaj wehs g kihkam amai hab waꞌap e kudu.
<sax> Herod summoned all the chief priests and religious teachers of the people, and asked them where the Messiah was supposed to be born. ||| Tsh g kownal am ha hekaj i ha hemapai g uꞌugchu papal ch chehanig t‑mashchamdam k ab ha kakke, “Bahtsh ab haꞌab wo mahsi hegai matsh g Jiosh d wo Kehshak mat d wo chum em‑kownaligk?”
<sax> He sent them to Bethlehem, telling them, “When you get there, search for the child. Once you find him let me know so that I can come and worship him too.” ||| Tsh g Herod am hahawa ha ahgi mat gam hu wo hihi Bethlehem wui hab ha ahgch, “Am g wo hihim k am wo si i gah hegai ali k hekid wo sha chehg k ia wo ni‑ahgi.

<sax> After they had heard what the king had to say they went on their way, and the star which they had seen in the east led them until it stopped right above the place where the child was.  When they saw the star they couldn't contain their happiness! ||| Kutsh gam hu hahawa hihim k gam hu hebai i hihim. Tsh ab ep i e mahsid hegai huꞌu mash am wa heki hu neid. Kush si s‑hehegig am i neidok. Tsh heg am ha baꞌich him k am dahiwua heg dahm mash am dadha hegam Joseph.
<sax> They went into the house and saw the child with Mary his mother. They bowed and worshiped him. Then they opened their bags of treasure and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh. ||| Tsh am dada k am i wahp kih ch ed. Sh am woꞌo hegai ali. Kush g jeꞌej am wehmaj.

<sax> Warned by a dream not to return to Herod, they left for their own country by a different route. ||| Sh g Jiosh am ha ahgid am ha‑chehchki ed matsh pi am hu ep wo hihi Herod wui. Kutsh heg hekaj im hu wabsh hihi e‑jewedga wui am hema wohg ch ed.
<sax> After they'd left, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, and told him, “Get up, and take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Remain there until I tell you, because Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.” ||| Tsh ab hahawa i e chehgi g anghil Joseph wui am chehchkij ed k ash hab kaij, “Kownal Herod at am wo i gahghi ihda ali mat wo chum s‑muꞌam.

<sax> So Joseph got up and took the boy and his mother, and left during the night for Egypt. ||| Kutsh am ha hekaj i wami g Joseph k am bei g ali ch jeꞌej k heg waꞌi s‑chuhugam hihi am Egypt wui
<sax> They stayed there until Herod's death. This fulfilled what the Lord said through the prophet, “I called my son out of Egypt.” ||| k am wa dadha.

<sax> When Herod realized he'd been fooled by the wise men, he got very angry. He sent men to kill all the young boys in Bethlehem and the regions nearby who were two years old and under. This was based on the time frame he'd discovered from the wise men. ||| Pegih, tsh pi am hu ep i hihi Herod wui hegam s‑chu aꞌamichuddam mash wa am ha ahgid g Jiosh. Tsh heg hekaj bagat g Herod.

<sax> “Get up! Take the child and his mother, and return to the land of Israel, because those who were trying to kill the child are dead.” ||| “Muh at hegai mat chum s‑muꞌam g ali. Mt heg hekaj wo wahpamig k wo uhpam hihi am e‑jewedga wui.”
<sax> So Joseph got up and took the boy and his mother, and returned to the land of Israel. ||| Kutsh am i wami g Joseph k am ha ui g ali ch jeꞌej k ep hihi am e‑jewedga wui.
<sax> But Joseph was afraid to go there after he learned that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod as king of Judea. Warned in a dream, Joseph went to the Galilee area, ||| K wabshaba g Herodbad alidag wenog am d kownal Judea ch ed ch hab chehgig Arkelaus.

<sax> Some time later John the Baptist appeared on the scene, proclaiming in the Judean desert, ||| Tsh am hahawa jegko i wuhsh Judea chekshani ch ed ihda mash d John ch ha pahl wapkon g hemajkam.
<sax> “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.” ||| John jehnigida ash hab chuꞌig, “Gam g hu wo s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegitoi. E o aihim mat in wo i wuhsh g Jiosh kownaltalig.”
<sax> He was the one Isaiah spoke about when he said, “A voice is heard crying out in the desert, ‘Prepare the way of the Lord. Make the paths straight for him.’ ” ||| Neh, id o hab ahg John hegai kelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam mash hab chehgig Isaiah mash eda hab kaij:
<sax> John had clothes made of camel hair, with a leather belt around his waist. His food was locusts and wild honey. ||| Sh ab e enigadadch g John g ka‑mihyo wopo ikuskaj ch ge hogi giwud ch heg waꞌi hekaj e gegosid kohktpul ch sitꞌol.
<sax> But when John saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to be baptized, he said to them, “You vipers' brood! Who warned you to run away from the coming judgment?  Show by what you do that you have truly repented, and don't presume to say proudly to yourselves, ‘Abraham is our father.’ I tell you that God could make children of Abraham from these stones. ||| Haꞌi atsh am dada hegam mo d Palasi ch hegam mo d Sajusi matsh wo nei ihda pahl wakona.

<sax> In fact the ax is ready to chop down the trees. Every tree that doesn't produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown into the fire. ||| Kumt ahpim gam hu wo s‑e ohhod hab masma mat g pi kehg bahidkam uꞌus mamtp pi gam hu wo s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegitoi k pi am hu hab wo junihid g s‑apꞌekam.”
<sax> Yes, I baptize you in water to show repentance, but after me is coming one who is greater than I am. I'm not worthy even to remove his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. ||| Kush hab ep kaij g John, “Pi g hab wo ni‑elid manis ahni d si haꞌichu. Ab at hema wo i wuhsh ni‑oidk k d wo si haꞌichuk.

<sax> Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John. ||| Jesus atsh ab hahawa i hih Galilee chekshani t amjed mo hebai d i kihkam k ab jiwia Jordan akimel t ab matsh wo e pahl wako.
<sax> But John tried to change his mind. He told Jesus, “I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me to baptize you?” ||| Sh g John chum pi pahl wakonamk hab kaijch, “Nis haschu ahgk wo m‑pahl wako nap pi d hekia s‑apꞌekam? Ahpi apt wo chum ni‑pahl wako.”
<sax> “Please do so, because it's good for us to do what God says is right,” Jesus told him. So John agreed to do it. ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Bapt wo ni‑juh no pi g Jiosh hab d elida.”
<sax> Right after he was baptized, Jesus came out of the water. The heavens were opened, and he saw God's Spirit like a dove descending, landing on him. ||| Tsh am haha wabsh i chum wuhsh g Jesus shuhdagi t amjed. Tsh g dahm kahchim gam i e kuhpiꞌo. Tsh ab i hud g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ab ab g Jesus hab sha masma mat g hohhi.
<sax> After fasting forty days and nights, he was hungry. ||| k am haꞌichugkahim giꞌikko wehst‑mahm tash ab pi haꞌichu koꞌadch nash pi e hoꞌigeꞌidahun ab Jiosh wui.

<sax> Jesus answered, “As Scripture says, ‘Human beings do not live by only eating bread, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.’ ” ||| Kush hab kaij g Jesus, “Pi ant hab wo juh. An o hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed:
<sax> Then the devil took him to the holy city and placed him on the top of the Temple. ||| Kutsh g ge Jiawul am hahawa wuhpuij tahgio i mahsid g geꞌe cheopi. Heg o am kehk amai mo hab e aꞌaga Si Hekia S‑apꞌekam Kihhim ch d Jerusalem.
<sax> “If you really are the son of God, then throw yourself off,” he told Jesus. “As Scripture says, ‘He will order his angels to save you from harm. They will catch you so that you won't fall by tripping over a stone.’ ” ||| Kush hab ahg, “Maptp woho d wo Jiosh alidagk, pegih, am g i dahꞌi amjed mo gan hu si uhgk kihtas.

<sax> Then the devil took Jesus to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in all their glory. ||| Kutsh am hahawa wuhpuij tahgio wehs i mahsid g kokownaltalig ch kaistalig jewed dahm

<sax> When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he returned to Galilee. ||| Am hu hebai amtsh am kuh hegai John mo am wa ha pahl wapkon. Kutsh am i kah g Jesus mamtsh kuh k atsh gam hu hahawa hih Galilee chekshani wui
<sax> Leaving Nazareth, he came to stay in Capernaum, on the shores of the sea in the regions of Zebulun and Naphthali. ||| k am jiwia Nazareth t ab. K am hema ep d kihhim mo d Capernaum ch an hugidaj an g Galilee kahchki. Kutsh am i dahiwua g Jesus.
<sax> This fulfilled what Isaiah the prophet said, ||| Neh, heki atki hu waꞌi oꞌoha g Isaiabad matsh id am hab wo e juh. K hegai oꞌohanaj hab chuꞌig:
<sax> From that time on Jesus began declaring his message, saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near.” ||| Kutsh wa woho am i wuhsh g Jesus k am i ahgahi g haꞌichu e‑ahga hab kaijch, “Gam g hu wo s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegitoi. E o aihim mat in wo i wuhsh g Jiosh kownaltalig.”
<sax> As he was walking by the sea of Galilee Jesus saw two brothers. Simon, also called Peter, and his brother Andrew, were casting a net in the sea. They made their living by catching fish. ||| Sh an him g Jesus Galilee kahchki hugid an. Kush am haꞌi oiopo g waptopi ha uꞌudam ch am wuhpa g chuagia shuhdagi ch ed ch hekaj am ha uꞌu g waptopi.

<sax> They left their nets immediately and followed him. ||| Kutsh am ha hekaj wabsh i dagito g e‑chikpan k am i oi.
<sax> Continuing on he saw two other brothers, James and John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets. He called them to follow him. ||| Tsh am shaꞌi hihi haꞌas huꞌi.

<sax> News about him spread throughout the province of Syria. They brought everyone who was sick to him: people troubled by seizures, the demon-possessed, those who were mentally ill, people who were paralyzed, and he healed all of them. ||| Tsh an wehsko i kaida g haꞌichu ahga ab amjed am Syria jewed ch ed mo heg eda g Galilee d chekshani.

<sax> When Jesus saw the crowds following him he went up a mountain. There he sat down together with his disciples. ||| Tsh am i ha nei g Jesus idam muꞌi hemajkam k ab i chesh kawulk t ab mat ab ha wui wo neo. Kutsh an wehgaj i e hemapai hegam mash ab si wecho e mashcham.
<sax> He began teaching them, saying: ||| Tsh g Jesus am i ha mashcha.
<sax> You are the salt of the earth, but if the salt becomes tasteless, how can you make it salty again? It's good for nothing, so it's thrown out and trodden down. ||| “Neh, s‑mahch am mat pi wo e padch g chuhkug mamtp wo si onmad.

<sax> You are the light of the world. A city built on a hill can't be hidden. ||| “Ahpim mam ab si ni‑hiwig amt wehs wo ha tonolidad g hemajkam. Heg o wa wepo mam d tonlig am ha wehhejed.

<sax> In the same way you should let your light shine before everyone so they can see the good things you do and praise your heavenly Father. ||| Pegih, mt ahpim pi wo ehsto g s‑em‑apꞌekam k wabsh wo ha hiwgidad g hemajkam mat wo nei. Kut hekaj ab wo si has elidad g em‑ohg Jiosh.
<sax> So whoever disregards the least important commandment, and teaches people to do so, will be called the least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever practices and teaches the commandments will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. ||| Kut d wabsh wo pi haꞌichuk am Jiosh nena ed hegai mat hedai pi am hu wo wohog elidad g Jiosh chehanig ch wo ha mashcha haꞌijj ehp mat hab waꞌap pi ab hu wo wohog elidad.

<sax> I tell you, unless your righteousness is more than that of the religious teachers and the Pharisees, you can never enter the kingdom of heaven. ||| Bo e elid g chehanig em‑mashchamdam ch Palasi mo s‑ap oid g Jiosh chehanig. Nt wabshaba wo em‑ahgi mamt hemho wa ha baꞌich i s‑ap wo oidad mamtp am s‑wahpkim Jiosh kihdag ed.
<sax> You've heard that the law said  to the people of long ago: ‘You shall not murder, and anyone who commits murder will be condemned as guilty.’ ||| “S‑mahch am mo hab chuꞌig g heki hu chehanig mamt pi wo ha mua g hemajkam. Kut hemho wa wo e lodai matp hedai wo sha ha mua.
<sax> But I tell you, anyone who is angry with his brother will be condemned as guilty. Whoever calls his brother an idiot has to answer to the council,  but whoever insults people is liable to the fire of judgment. ||| Kunt ahni am baꞌich hab wo i ah mamt am wa hugkam ab wo moht g chuꞌijig mo g ha muꞌakam mamt chum hems wabsh wo bagat ab hema i wui k hab wo ah mo d wabsh pad haꞌichu.

<sax> If you're at the altar making an offering, and remember that your brother has something against you, ||| “Am g wo haꞌasa e hoꞌigeꞌidahun mamtp wo s‑chegito mamt hema i pi ap dohdda. Pi at ab hu wo em‑kaiha g Jiosh.
<sax> leave your offering on the altar and go and make peace with him first, and afterwards come back and make your offering. ||| Wehpeg amt am wo i e apꞌech heg wui mamt pi ap dohdda k am haha wo e‑hoꞌigeꞌidahu.
<sax> While you're on the way to court with your opponent, make sure you settle things quickly. Otherwise your opponent might hand you over to the judge, and the judge will hand you over to the court official, and you will be thrown into jail.  I tell you the truth: you won't get out of there until you've paid every last penny. ||| Mtp hems wo em‑lodai mamtp pi am hu s‑hohtam wo i e apꞌech.

<sax> You've heard that the law said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’ ||| “S‑mahch am mo hab chuꞌig g heki hu chehanig mamt pi wo ha ehs g ha‑wehm kihkam.
<sax> If your right hand leads you to sin, then cut it off and throw it away, for it's better for you to lose one of your limbs than for your whole body to go into the fire of judgment. ||| Do em‑wuikam mamt am hu wo i e wua Jiawul kih ed chum ams haschu pi apꞌekam hab wo juh. K baꞌich i s‑apꞌe mamt chum hems wo heb hu wua g e‑nowi.

<sax> But I tell you that any man who divorces his wife except for sexual immorality causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. ||| Nt wabshaba am wo em‑ahgi mat d wo pi apꞌekamk mamt wo s‑ohhod, heg hi wa mamt wo s‑mai am i chum hohntk mat heki hu ha wehm woꞌiwua.

<sax> And again, you've heard that the law said to the people of long ago, ‘You shall not perjure yourself. Instead make sure you keep the oaths you swear to the Lord.’ ||| “S‑mahch am mo hab chuꞌig g heki hu chehanig mamt pi wo ha iattogidad ch hemho am hab wo wa juh mam haschu ha ahgid ch chehcheg g Jiosh.
<sax> But I tell you, don't swear at all. Don't swear by heaven, because it's the throne of God. ||| Nt wabshaba am wo em‑ahgi mamt hemho am hab wo wa juh g e‑neꞌoki.

<sax> Give to those who ask you, and don't turn away those who want to borrow from you. ||| Pi g wo shaꞌi daꞌid matp haschu i tatchua g shoꞌigkam.
<sax> You've heard that the law said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’ ||| “S‑mahch am mo e ahgachug mamt ab wo si ha tatchuad g e‑naipijju ch wo s‑ha kehꞌidad g e‑obga.
<sax> But I tell you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,  so you may become children of your heavenly Father. For his sun shines on both the good and the bad; and he makes the rain fall on both those who do right and those who do wrong.  For if you only love those who love you, what reward do you have? Don't even the tax-collectors do that?  If you only speak kindly to your family, what more are you doing than anyone else? Even the heathen  do that! ||| Nt wabshaba am wo em‑ahgi mamt pi hegam waꞌi ab wo si ha tatchuad e‑naipijju.

<sax> Grow up and become completely trustworthy, just as your heavenly Father is trustworthy. ||| Em‑ohg Jiosh o d si hekia s‑apꞌekam. Pegih, mt ahpim hab waꞌap d wo si hekia s‑apꞌekamk.”
<sax> Make sure not to do your good deeds in front of people, just so they can be seen. Otherwise you won't have any reward from your Father in heaven. ||| Kush hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Am g wo s‑e nenꞌoidad mamt pi am hu hab wabsh wo wuad g haꞌichu s‑apꞌekam hab ahgk mat g hemajkam wo neidad mam haschu am hab junihim.

<sax> When you give to the poor, don't be like the hypocrites who blow their own trumpets to announce what they're doing in the synagogues and in the streets so that people will praise them. I tell you the truth: they already have their reward. ||| “Pi g wo s‑e chehgidamk mamt hekid wo i ha wehmt g shoꞌigkam.

<sax> For if you forgive those who sin against you, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. ||| Neh, bamt masma am wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahunad Jiosh wui wabsh pi chegitok g pi ap ha‑chuꞌijig. T g Jiosh gam hu hab wo i juh g pi ap em‑chuꞌijig.
<sax> But if you don't forgive those who sin against you, then your heavenly Father won't forgive your sins. ||| T wabshaba g em‑chuꞌijig pi gam hab wo i e juh mamtp pi wo pi chegito g ha‑chuꞌijig.
<sax> When you fast, don't be like the hypocrites who put on sad faces and make themselves look terrible so that everyone can see they're fasting. I tell you the truth, they already have their reward. ||| “Pi g wo s‑e chehgidamk mam pi ap e tahtk mamt hekid heꞌekkio pi wo e gegos e hoꞌigeꞌidahunch. Hegam mat wo s‑e chehgidam at wo nei g e‑namkidadag mat g hemajkam ab wo si has ha el. Nt wabshaba wo si shel em‑ahgi mat g Jiosh pi ab hu has wo ha el.
<sax> Don't pile up wealth here on earth where moths and rust ruin it, and where thieves break in and steal it. ||| “Pi g an hu wo e toꞌidahid g s‑kaisdag id dahm jewed. Tp hems wabsh wo padt o atp hems hema wo em‑ehs.
<sax> Instead, you should store up your wealth in heaven, where moths and rust don't ruin it, and where thieves don't break in and steal it. ||| Mt wabshaba wo hekaj g e‑kaisdag am Jiosh wehhejed. T heg wo wa wepok mam heg an e toꞌidahim Jiosh kihdag ed. T pi hekid wo padt. Kut pi hedai wo em‑ehs.
<sax> For wherever you store your wealth, that's where your heart will be too. ||| Kumt am wo s‑hihimim no pi g em‑tatchuidag am ulinig mo hebai haꞌichug mam haschu hab i elid mo d em‑kaisdag.
<sax> The eye is like a lamp that lights the body. So if your eye is healthy,  then your whole body will have light. ||| “Em‑wuhpui at s‑ap am wo i wahki g tonlig matp wo s‑mamsk
<sax> But if your eye is evil, then your whole body will be in the dark. If the light in you is darkness, how dark is that! ||| k wabshaba pi am hu wo i wahki matp pi wo mamsk.

<sax> No one can serve two masters. Either you'll hate one and love the other, or you'll be devoted to one and despise the other. You can't serve both God and Money. ||| “Pi at hedai wo e nako mas ha wepo hab masma ab wo ha neidad g gohk e‑aꞌamo. Hemho wa atp hems hema baꞌich wo i s‑wohog elidad. Em‑kaisdag o heg wa wepo mo d em‑ahmo mamtp heg hekaj baꞌich wo i pihk e elidad mam hi g Jiosh.
<sax> That's why I'm telling you not to worry about your life. Don't worry about what to eat, or what to drink, or what clothes to put on. Isn't life more than food, and the body more than clothes? ||| “Neh, nt heg hekaj hab wo em‑ah mamt pi wabsh wo i e kudutad heg hekaj mams haschukaj wo e gegos o mams haschukaj wo e enigadad. Jiosh at ab em‑mah g em‑doakag, pegih, k ab hab waꞌap wo em‑mah mamt haschukaj wo e dagioꞌidad.
<sax> Look at the birds they don't sow or reap or store food in barns, for your heavenly Father feeds them. Aren't you worth more than they are? ||| An g wo i ha neid hegam uꞌuwhig mo an nenꞌe.

<sax> But I tell you, not even Solomon in all his glory was dressed like one of these flowers. ||| Solomonbad o pi hab masma s‑kehg e enigadadch, chum as d si s‑kais kownal.
<sax> So if God decorates the fields like this, grass which is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the fire, won't he do much more for you, you people who trust so little? ||| Neh, haꞌichu wuhshanig o wabsh al heꞌekia tash an hab chuꞌig.

<sax> These are all the things that the heathen chase after, but your heavenly Father knows everything you need. ||| Hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh o id am wa si oid. M eda ahpim d Jiosh aꞌaliga. K heg s‑mahch mam tatchua wehs ihda.
<sax> Seek his kingdom first, and his way of doing right, and everything will be given to you. ||| Wehpeg g am wo i e dagitok Jiosh wui k hab d wo s‑apꞌekamk. Kut heg wehs ab wo i em‑mah mam haschu i tatchua.
<sax> So don't worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow can worry about itself. There's already enough evil in every day. ||| “Pi g am wo shaꞌi e kudutad heg amjed mat haschu has wo i e juh baꞌich tash. Am o wa haꞌichug g em‑kudutadag id i tashkaj ch pi hab chum mahs mams g siꞌalim kudutadag ab wo i wehnad.
<sax> Don't judge others, so that you won't be judged. ||| “Pi g am hedai has wo ahgad nat pi ab uhpam wo i e nodagi em‑wui.
<sax> For whatever standard you use to judge others will be used to judge you, and whatever measurement you use to measure others will be used to measure you. ||| Mamt has i masma wo has ha ahgad, t ab wo i nod em‑wui g has ahgadag hab masma. Ab at wo i e nodagi em‑wui mamt has i masma ab wo neidad hema.
<sax> Don't give dogs what's holy. Don't throw your pearls to pigs. That way the pigs won't trample them underfoot, and the dogs won't turn and attack you. ||| “Pi g ab hu wo ha ahgid g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga hegam mo pi ab hu tatchua.

<sax> Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you. Everyone who asks, receives; everyone who seeks, finds; and everyone who knocks has the door opened for them. ||| “Ab g wo ha tahnid haꞌichu k ab wo bebhed. Am g wo e gahgidad haꞌichu k wo cheh. Ab g wo shontpagad. T ab wo i e kuhpiꞌo g pualit em‑wehhejed.
<sax> Would any of you give your son a stone if he asked for bread? ||| Ahpim oꞌog, namt hig wabsh g hodai wo mah g e‑alidag mat g simito wo em‑tai
<sax> Or if he asked for fish, would you give him a snake? ||| o wabsh g wamad wo mah mat g watopi hidod ab wo em‑tai?
<sax> So if even you who are evil know to give good things to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give good things to those who ask him. ||| Chum ams d pi apꞌekam ch eda s‑mahch mamt s‑kehg haꞌichu wo ha mah g e‑aꞌaliga. Wahm hig g em‑ohg Jiosh at woho baꞌich i s‑kehg haꞌichu ab wo em‑mah mamt ab wo tahnid haꞌichu.
<sax> Treat others the way you want them to treat you. This sums up the law and the prophets. ||| “Am g hab wo ha juhkchid g hemajkam mam has i chum ha elid mat hab wo em‑juhkchid. Bamt masma wehs am hab wo juh mo haschu an oꞌohanas Jiosh heki hu oꞌohana ed.
<sax> Enter by the narrow entrance. For the entrance is wide, and the way is broad that leads to destruction, and many travel that way.  But the entrance is narrow, and the way is difficult that leads to life, and only a few find it. ||| “Am g wo i e dagitok Jiosh wui k ab wo s‑wohog elidad.

<sax> When Jesus finished explaining these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, ||| Neh, tsh am i haꞌasa ha mashcha g Jesus. Tsh g hemajkam si has i el
<sax> for he taught like someone with authority, and not like their religious teachers. ||| no pi s‑e mamachim ha mashcham. Sh eda hegam mo d chum chehanig ha mashchamdam pi hab masma s‑e mamachim ha mashcham.
<sax> Large crowds followed Jesus once he'd come down from the mountain. ||| Tsh ab hahawa i hud g Jesus kawulk t amjed. Tsh ab i oi hegam muꞌi hemajkam mo an wehmaj.
<sax> A leper approached him and bowed down, worshiping him, and said, “Lord, if you're willing, please heal me.” ||| Tsh am hema jiwia g oꞌodham mash mumku heg hekaj mumkidag mo g chuhkugaj muhkhim k atsh ab i gei Jesus wecho k hab kaij, “S‑apꞌekam ni‑kownalig, ab g si i s‑ni‑hoꞌigeꞌid k i ni‑doajid, pej maptp wo tatchuad.”
<sax> Jesus reached out and touched him with his hand. “I am willing,” he said. “Be healed!” Immediately he was healed from his leprosy. ||| Tsh g Jesus ab tahtam k hab kaij, “Am o wa s‑apꞌe. Doajini.”
<sax> “Make sure you don't tell anyone,” Jesus told him. “Go and show yourself to the priest and give the offering which Moses required as public proof.” ||| Sh hab hahawa kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Neh, pi apt hedai wo ahgid k wabshaba am ha hekaj wo hih pahl wui.

<sax> For I am myself under the authority of superiors, while I also have soldiers under my command. I command one, ‘Go!’ and he goes. I command another, ‘Come!’ and he comes. I tell my servant, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.” ||| Bo wa masma ab haꞌichu ni‑chehani g ni‑geꞌejig. Kuni ab s‑wohog elid. K g ni‑shondalig hab waꞌap ab s‑ni‑wohog elid.

<sax> When Jesus heard what he said, he was astonished.

<sax> “Go!” said Jesus. The demons left the men and went into the pigs. The whole herd ran down the steep hillside into the sea and drowned. ||| Sh hab ha ahg g Jesus, “Hijiwo.”

They went to the town and told the people there everything that had taken place, and what had happened to the demon-possessed men. ||| Kutsh hegam mash am ha nuhkud idam kokji gam hu si wohp k am dada kihhim t am k am ha ahgid mat haschu has e juh am ha tahgio idam oꞌodham mash g jijawul an ha uꞌukch.

<sax> Wherever you go, whatever town or village, ask for someone who lives according to good principles, and remain there until you leave.  When you enter the house, give it your blessing.  If the home deserves it, let your peace rest on it, but if it doesn't deserve it, let your peace return to you. If someone doesn't welcome you, and refuses to listen to what you have to say, then leave that house or that town, shaking its dust off your feet as you go. ||| “Mt am wo i wahp kihhim ch ed k an wo i ha gahghi hegam mat hedai s‑ap ab wo i em‑nei k ab ha wui hab wo chei, ‘Jiosh o ab em‑makiog g si geꞌe s‑ap tahhadkam.’ Kut am wo i em‑wahpkid k wo em‑dagioꞌi am hugkam mamt hekid gm hu baꞌich ep wo i hihi.

<sax> Disciples are not more important than their teacher; servants are not more important than their master.  Disciples should be satisfied to become like their teacher, and servants like their master. If the head of the house has been called the head demon Beelzebub,  then the members of his household will be demonized even more! ||| “E mashchamdam o ab wabsh wecho hegai mo d ha mashchamdam ch heg hekaj wepo wo nako haꞌichu.

<sax> Those who say something against the Son of man will be forgiven, but those who say something against the Holy Spirit won't be forgiven, neither in this life nor the next. ||| Im at hu hab wo i juh g Jiosh g chuꞌijigaj hegai mat ab wo has ni‑ah ahni Jiosh si Kehsha k wabshaba pi hekid gam hu hab wo i juh g chuꞌijigaj hegai mat wo has ah g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag.
<sax> Either decide that the tree is good, and its fruit is good, or decide that the tree is bad and its fruit is bad—for the tree is known by its fruit. ||| “Mt wo s‑mai mas hedai d s‑apꞌekam oꞌodham hab masma mamt wo s‑mai mas s‑kehgaj g bahidkam uhs. S‑kehg uhs at wo s‑kehg bahidagt. T g pi kehg uhs wo pi kehg bahidagt.
<sax> I tell you, people will have to account for every careless thing they say on the Day of Judgment.  For what you say will either vindicate you or condemn you.” ||| “Id ant hab wo chei mat hemho wa wehs haꞌichu am wo mahsko e wua lodaita tash ch ed mam haschu has i kaij id dahm jewed. Jiosh at wo hekaj g hejel em‑neꞌoki mat wo em‑lodai, chum hems g s‑pehegi em‑neꞌoki.”
<sax> Then some of the religious teachers and Pharisees came to him and said, “Teacher, we want you to show us a miraculous sign.” ||| D am haꞌi haꞌichug g chehanig t‑mashchamdam ch Palasi ch hab ahg g Jesus, “Ha mashchamdam, ab g t‑chehgid g s‑hasig haꞌichukaj maptp woho d Jiosh si Kehsha.”
<sax> “Evil people who don't trust in God are the ones who look for a miraculous sign. The only sign they will be given is the sign of the prophet Jonah,” Jesus told them. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus, “Si o hig woho pi apꞌe ch mehk ab amjed g Jiosh hegam mat pi ab hu wo ni‑hiwgam k hoꞌip nei g s‑hasig haꞌichu. Heg ant ab wo waꞌi ha chehgi mant am oidk hab wo ni‑juh hegai Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam mash hab chehgig Jonah.
<sax> “In the same way Jonah was in the belly of a huge fish for three days and three nights, the Son of man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights. ||| Id ash wa waik tash oidam am haꞌichug geꞌe watopi wohk ed. Neh, nt hab wa masma waik tash oidam am wo kahchk hihaꞌini ch ed ahni Jiosh si Kehsha.
<sax> The people of Nineveh will rise in the judgment together with this generation and they will condemn it because they repented in response to Jonah's message—and as you see, there's someone greater than Jonah here! ||| “Jonabad ash wa am ha ahgid g Ninevah t am hemajkam g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.

<sax> The Queen of the South will be raised in the judgment together with this generation and will condemn it because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon—and as you see, there's someone greater than Solomon here! ||| “Mehkjed atsh ab i hih g uwi kownal ab Sheba jewed t amjed matsh ab wo kaiha g Solomonbad haꞌichu mahchig.

<sax> When an evil spirit leaves someone, it wanders through deserted places looking for rest, and finds nowhere to stay. ||| Kud hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Matp hems g jiawul an wo hema uꞌukch g oꞌodham k wabsh wo dagito mat am hebai ep wo e ul. Kut hegai oꞌodham wo i chum kegch g e‑doakag. T wabshaba g jiawul pi hebai wo chehg.
<sax> So it says, ‘I'll go back to the place I left,’ and when it returns it finds the place empty, all clean and tidy. ||| K hekaj hab wo i e ah, ‘Mo hig woho d ni‑kih hegai oꞌodham. Nt hig am uhpam wo hih wui.’ Kut wa woho am wo uhpam him k wo cheh mo am wabsh jeg ch si kegchudas ch hehosimhunas.

<sax> “Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?” Jesus asked.  He pointed at his disciples, and said, “Look, they are my mother and my brothers! ||| D g Jesus hab ahg, “Neh, idam mo ab ni‑kaiham o heg wa wepo mo d ni‑jeꞌe ch ni‑wepnag.
<sax> For those who do the will of my heavenly Father, they are my brother, sister, and mother!” ||| Hegam mat hab wo junihid g ni‑ohg Jiosh tatchui o hab masma mo d ni‑wepnag ch ni‑jeꞌe.”
<sax> Later that day Jesus left the house, and sat down to teach  beside the lake. ||| Heg waꞌi tash ed achd gam hu hihi Galilee Kahchki wui. D am i chum dahiwua g Jesus mat wo t‑mashcha.
<sax> So many people gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat down there to teach, while all the crowds stood on the beach. ||| Kud wabshaba shaꞌi muꞌi hemajkam an e hemapai wehgaj. D heg hekaj gan hu i chesh g Jesus wahlko ch ed k an dahiwua k amjed ha mashcham. D g hemajkam an gegok shuhdagi koa an ch amjed ab kaiham.
<sax> He explained many things to them, using stories as illustrations. ||| Kud muꞌi haꞌichu ha tashogid g wepogida ahgakaj ab amjed g Jiosh kownaltalig. Id o d haꞌichu ahgaj mo hab kaij:
<sax> “As he was sowing, some of the seeds fell on the path. The birds came and ate them up. ||| T haꞌi gan hu shul wohg ch ed. T g uꞌuwhig am dada k koꞌito.

<sax> Still other seeds fell on good soil. They produced a harvest—some one hundred, some sixty, and some thirty times what had been planted. ||| T wabshaba hegam mat an s‑ap shul moihuna ch ed an wuhshani k muꞌi ab kait. Haꞌi at siant ab kait ch haꞌi chuhdpo wehst‑mahm ch haꞌi waikko wehst‑mahm.”
<sax> Anybody who has ears should be listening!” ||| Kud hab hahawa ep kaij g Jesus, “Neh, am g wo s‑ap i aꞌamichud ihda.”
<sax> The disciples came to Jesus and asked him, “Why do you use illustrations when you speak to the people?” ||| D am hahawa i e hejelko. Kuchd am wui hihim k ab kakke mas haschu ahgch pi ta amichudam ha mashcham g haꞌichu wepogidakaj.
<sax> “You're privileged to have revealed to you the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but they're not given such insights,” Jesus replied. ||| D hab kaij, “Nt wo em‑ahgi mo has d ahga no pi g Jiosh em‑hiwgid mamt wo s‑mai mo haschu hemu am maskogid ab amjed g e‑kownaltalig. Ni wabshaba heg waꞌi ha ahgid haꞌichu wepogida ahga hegam mo pi ab hu wohochudamk. T hab pi wo amich haꞌichu ab amjed g Jiosh kownaltalig.
<sax> “Those who already have will have more given to them, more than enough. But those who don't have, whatever they have will be taken away from them. ||| Hegam mat s‑ap wo hekaj g e‑apꞌedag at baꞌich ep wo i nei. T hegam mat pi ap wo hekaj wabsh wo heb hu wua.
<sax> That's why I speak to them in illustrations. For even though they see, they do not see; and even though they hear, they do not hear; nor do they understand. ||| Heg ani hekaj g haꞌichu wepogidakaj haꞌichu ha ahgid:
<sax> So listen to the story of the sower. ||| “Am ant haha wo em‑ahgi mani haschu chum em‑mashcham id hekaj haꞌichu ni‑ahga ab amjed g haꞌichu eshdam. Heg kaichka ani wepogid g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. Id o am e gantan ha shahgid g hemajkam hab masma mo g haꞌichu kai.
<sax> When people hear the message about the kingdom, and don't understand it, the Evil One comes along and rips out what was sown in their heart. This is what happens to the seeds sown on the path. ||| K eda haꞌi pi amichud no pi g ha‑iꞌibdag s‑kawpk hab sha masma mo g wohg. K g Jiawul am wabsh s‑pehegi ha wohppoꞌid mo haschu i kah.
<sax> The seeds sown among thorns are people who hear the message, but then life's worries and the temptation of money choke the message so that they become fruitless. ||| “K haꞌi g ha‑iꞌibdag hab sha masma mo hebai s‑shaꞌig. K am ha shaꞌijidch g pihk ha‑elidadag ch s‑ha‑kaisdag. Kut pi haꞌichu wehhejed wo s‑kehgajk am Jiosh wehhejed.
<sax> The seeds sown on good soil are people who hear the message, and understand it, and who produce a good harvest—some one hundred, some sixty, and some thirty times what was sown.” ||| “K haꞌi g ha‑iꞌibdag s‑moik hab sha masma mo g moihuna. Idam at wo s‑amich g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga k am wo ahgachugad matp hems haꞌi siant ab ep wo ha baꞌiha k atp hems haꞌi chuhdpo wehst‑mahm k haꞌi g waikko wehst‑mahm ab ep wo ha baꞌiha.”
<sax> Then he told them another illustrated story: “The kingdom of heaven is like a farmer who sowed good seeds in his field. ||| Jesus ad am hema ep ha ahgi g hemajkam g haꞌichu wepogida hab kaijch, “Am ant baꞌichu ep wo i em‑tashogi g Jiosh kownaltalig wepogidch mat hema ei g s‑kehg kai e‑oid ed.
<sax> But while his workers were sleeping, an enemy came and sowed weed seeds on top of the wheat. Then they left. ||| T am hu hebai haha wabsh hema jiwia g obgaj chuhug ch ed mo wehsijj kohksh k g shaꞌi kai am ei ha shahgid g pilkani k gam hu hahawa ep hih.
<sax> So when the wheat grew and produced ears of grain, the weeds also grew up. ||| Kut am i wuhsh g eꞌes k ab i mudadt. T am hahawa s‑masma i wuhsh g shaꞌi.
<sax> The farmer's workers came and asked him, ‘Sir, didn't you sow good seeds in your field? Where did the weeds come from?’ ||| “K hab kaij g eshdam pionag, ‘S hebai amjed i wuhsh g shaꞌi mapt wa eda t‑mah g s‑kehg kaichka.’
<sax> ‘Some enemy has done this,’ he replied. ‘Do you want us to go and pull up the weeds?’ they asked him. ||| “K hab kaij am ha wui, ‘Ni‑obga at hab juh ihda.’
<sax> ‘No,’ he answered, ‘as you pull up the weeds, you might uproot the wheat too. ||| “K hab ha ahg, ‘Piaꞌa. Mt wo am hu wabsh g pilkani ha huhpsh.
<sax> Even though it's the tiniest of seeds it grows much bigger than other plants. In fact it grows into a tree big enough for birds to roost in its branches.” ||| Neh, heg am eꞌesha mo al chumaj ch oi wa am wo wuhshani k haꞌas wo i geꞌeda mo g s‑ehheg uhs. Tp hems g uꞌuwhig an ab wo koksht. Pegih, t hab wa masma wo geꞌe i geꞌeda g Jiosh kownaltalig, chum as al chum am wo shonwua.”
<sax> He told them another illustrated story: “The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman mixed with a large quantity of flour, until all the dough was raised.” ||| D am hema ep ah g haꞌichu wepogida g Jesus hab kaijch, “Jiosh kownaltalig o hab waꞌap wepogidas mo g jewajidakud.

<sax> Jesus explained all these things to the crowds using illustrated stories—in fact he didn't speak to them without using stories. ||| Jesus ad haschu i ha ahgid g hemajkam ch heg waꞌi hekaj haꞌichu wepogida ahga.
<sax> This fulfilled the prophet's words: “I will speak using stories, and I will explain things hidden from the creation of the world.” ||| Heki atki hu waꞌi oꞌoha g kelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam mat id am hab wo wa e juh. K hab chuꞌig g oꞌohanaj:
<sax> Then he left the crowds and went into a house. His disciples came over to him, and asked him, “Please explain to us the story about the weeds in the field.” ||| D g Jesus gam hu ha dagito g hemajkam k ged hu i wah kih ch ed. Kuchd am wehmaj hihim k ab hahawa kakke mas has d ahga hegai wepogida ahga ab amjed g shaꞌi mo am t‑ahgid.
<sax> “The one who sows the good seed is the Son of man,” Jesus explained. ||| D hab kaij, “Heg ani wepogidas mo g haꞌichu eshdam ahni Jiosh si Kehsha.
<sax> “The field is the world. The good seeds are the children of the kingdom. The weed seeds are the children of the Evil One.  The enemy that sowed the weed seeds is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world. The reapers are angels. ||| K g oidag d ihda jewed. K g s‑kehg kai d hegam mat wo e doꞌibia k am wo haꞌichugk Jiosh kownaltalig ed. K g ni‑obga d jijawul ha‑geꞌejig. K g eshaj d hegam mat pi wo e doꞌibia. Hihka tash o d lodaita tash. K hegam mat hab wo juh g hihka d anghil.
<sax> Just as the weeds are harvested and burned so it will be at the end of the world. ||| “Hegai shaꞌi mehidda o hab d ahga mat g pi ap hehemajkam gam hu wo i e shul jiawul kih ed mat hekid wo i e ai g lodaita tash.
<sax> Then those who live rightly will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their father. Anybody with ears should be listening! ||| T am hahawa wo si tondad g s‑apꞌekam hemajkam e‑ohg Jiosh kownaltalig ed. Neh, am g wo i aꞌamichud ihda ahpim mam kah!”
<sax> The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field. A man found it, reburied it, and then full of joy went and sold all he had and bought that field. ||| D am hema ep ah g Jesus g haꞌichu wepogida ahga hab kaijch, “Jiosh kownaltalig o heg wepogidas mo g s‑namkig haꞌichu mat am hema ehsto oidag ch ed k hahawa muh. T am hema haha wabsh chehg k am wabsh uhpam i maꞌishp k si s‑hehgig ch am i wehs gagda g haꞌichu e‑eniga k am hahawa uhpam ep him k wabsh wehs ha nolawt ihda oidag.”
<sax> The kingdom of heaven is also like a trader looking for good pearls.  When he found the most expensive pearl ever he went and sold all he had and bought it. ||| Kud hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Bamt masma wo s‑behim g Jiosh kownaltalig mat g s‑namkig hohodai nolawtdam wo s‑behim hegai mat wehs ha baꞌich wo i s‑kehgajk. Heg at wehs wo gagda g haꞌichu e‑eniga mat wo e nakog k wo ha nolawt hegai s‑namkigchu.”
<sax> Once more, the kingdom of heaven is like a fishing net thrown into the sea that caught all kinds of fish. ||| D hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Am ant heꞌes wo i em‑tashogi g Jiosh kownaltalig am wepogidch g waptopi uꞌikud chuagia. Heg at am wo wua g waptopi ha uꞌudam shuhdagi ch ed. T am wo e baꞌiha g nahnko mahs waptopi.
<sax> When it was full it was dragged ashore. The good fish were put into baskets while the bad ones were thrown away. ||| Kut am wo i wanchkwua shuhdagi hugid an k am wo dahiwua k wo i ha gawulkad k hegam wo e toꞌi mo s‑kehgaj k g pi kehg waptopi gam hu wo nehnich.
<sax> That's the way it will be when the end of the world comes. The angels will go out and separate the evil people from the good, ||| Bat wo wa masmak mat hekid wo i e ai g lodaita tash. Anghil at am wo aꞌai hihim k am wo i ha gawulkai g pi apꞌekam hemajkam
<sax> and throw them into the blazing furnace where there will be weeping and grinding of teeth. ||| k ged hu wo ha shul mei ch ed. T idam wo si shoanid ch ga hu wabsh wo i si e kiꞌishch nat pi wo shaꞌi si s‑koꞌok haꞌichu nakogad.”
<sax> Now do you understood everything?” ||| D g Jesus ab hahawa t‑kakke, “Namt am wa s‑amich wehs ihda?”
<sax> He went back to his home town and taught in the synagogue there. People were amazed, and asked, “Where does he get his wisdom and miracles from? ||| Kuchd gam hu hihi Nazareth wui mo am d si kihkam. D g Jesus am haꞌichu ha mashcham ha‑cheopi ed.
<sax> Isn't this the carpenter's son? Isn't his mother's name Mary, and his brothers James, and Joseph, and Simon, and Judas? ||| No hig pi woho d alidaj hegai t‑nawojbad mo d huk chikpandam? No hig pi g Mary d jeꞌej ch g wepngaj d James ch Joses ch Simon ch Jude.
<sax> Don't his sisters live here among us? So where does he get all this from?” ||| Ia o wa kih g uꞌuwigaj. Kus hebai mai wehs ihda.”
<sax> And so they refused to believe in him. ||| Neh, bad kaij ch wabsh pi haꞌichuch.
<sax> Since they failed to trust in him, he did not do many miracles there. ||| Neh, bad kaij ch pi muꞌi s‑hasig haꞌichu hab juh amai no pi pi ab hu wohochud idam mas d Jiosh si Kehsha.
<sax> At that time Herod the tetrarch heard what Jesus was doing ||| D eda am hahasko haꞌi d ha‑kokownalig g Tutuligo ch d giꞌik. D idam am hema d kownal Galilee chekshani ch ed ch hab chehgig Herod. Kumd eda wehsko aꞌaga g Jesus.
<sax> and he told his servants, “He must be John the Baptist resurrected from the dead, and that's why he has such powers!” ||| Kush id hab ha ahgid g e‑hahaꞌichuga, “Heg oki d hegai mo wa ha pahl wapkonahim ch hab chehgig John. Mua ant. Kutki wabshaba uhpam e chegito k hekaj hab e nakog mat hab wo juh g s‑hasig haꞌichu.”
<sax> Herod had detained John, and had him put in chains and imprisoned on account of Herodias, the wife of Philip, his brother. ||| Herod atsh wa an bei g John k wulshp k ged hu si kuh am wehhejed g e‑hohnig. Id ash hab chehgig Herodias ch ash d chum hohnigaj g Herod wehnag. Kush heg hab chehgig Philip. Tsh g Herod ehs g hohnigaj.
<sax> However, on Herod's birthday the daughter of Herodias danced for the party, and Herod was delighted with her. ||| Kutsh am i e ai g Herod mahsidag. Sh geꞌe piastchud. Tsh g Herodias uwi mad am e waila ha tahgio. Tsh g Herod si s‑hohhoꞌi ihda
<sax> So he promised with an oath to give her whatever she wanted. ||| k wehs ha kaichudch si s‑kaidam hab kaij mat hemho wa wo mah mat haschu ab wo i tai.
<sax> Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me here on a plate the head of John the Baptist.” ||| Sh g jeꞌej hab ahg mat hab wo chei mat ab wo mah g moꞌoj g John am hoas‑haꞌa ch ed dahshk. Tsh wa woho heg ab tai.
<sax> Then the king regretted the promise he had made, but because of the oaths he'd made in front of his dinner guests, he gave the order to do it. ||| Kutsh si pi ap e taht g kownal. Sh wabshaba wehsijj kah mo has i kaij. Tsh heg hekaj pi e nako mas pi am hu hab wo juh
<sax> The order was passed on and John was beheaded in prison. ||| k am hahawa hema cheha g shondal mat an wo him k wo shonch g John moꞌo.
<sax> John's head was brought on a plate and given to the girl, who took it to her mother. ||| Tsh wa woho hab e juh k am hahawa uꞌapa g moꞌoj am hoas‑haꞌa ch ed dahshch k ab mah ihda uwi. Kut ihda gd hu hahawa epai mah g e‑jeꞌe.
<sax> John's disciples came and took the body, and buried him. Then they went and told Jesus. ||| Kutsh am hahawa dada hegam mad ab si wecho e mashcham g John k am bei g honshpadaj k ged hu chehg k am hahawa hihim k ged hu ahgid g Jesus.
<sax> When Jesus heard the news he went away by boat to a quiet place to be alone, but when the crowds learned where he was, they followed him on foot from the towns. ||| D am i kah g Jesus mamt mua g John k am hahawa gam hu hejelko s‑himimk.

<sax> But Jesus told them, “They don't need to leave. You give them something to eat!” ||| D hab kaij g Jesus ab t‑wui, “Ahpim amt wo haꞌichu ha mah mat wo huh.”
<sax> “All we have here are five loaves and a couple of fish,” they replied. ||| Kuchd hab kaij ab wui, “Pi ach geꞌe haꞌichu edgid. Al hetasp sismito ch gohk waptopi ach am toꞌakch.”
<sax> “Bring them to me,” said Jesus. ||| D hab hahawa ep kaij g Jesus, “Ab g wo i uꞌukaꞌi.” Kud am e uꞌapa.
<sax> He told the crowds to sit down on the grass. Then he took the five loaves and the two fish, looked up to heaven and blessed them. After that he broke the loaves into pieces and gave the bread to the disciples, and the disciples gave it to the crowds. ||| D am hahawa ha cheha g hemajkam mat am wo dadhaiwua washai ch ed.

<sax> Everybody ate until they were full. Then they collected up the leftovers which filled twelve baskets. ||| Kuchd wehsijj hug k kokwod. Kuchd ahchim chuhchaij an hahawa i uꞌihim k uꞌapa g wihpiꞌidaj mat am huꞌi gamai gohk hoha wo ha shuhshud.
<sax> Some five thousand men ate the food, not counting women and children. ||| Kuchd am hu d i hetasp mihl chechoj ch muꞌijj g uꞌuwi ch aꞌal ehp.
<sax> Right after this he made the disciples get into the boat and go back to the other side of the lake while he sent the crowds on their way. ||| D am hahawa t‑ahgi g Jesus matt gam hu aigo wo hihi. Tsh heg am wo wiꞌi k am wo ha ahgi g hemajkam mat gam hu wo hihi e‑kihki wui. Kuchd an i chehchsh wahlko ch ed k gam hu hihi.
<sax> After he'd sent the crowds away, he went up into the mountains to pray. Evening came and he was there all alone. ||| D g Jesus am ha dagito g hemajkam. Kud gam hu himto. D am hahawa hejel i chesh kawulk dahm k am e hoꞌigeꞌidahu. D am i hud. D am wabsh kia hejel haꞌichug.
<sax> When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified. They screamed out in fear, “It's a ghost!” ||| Kuchd ab i neidok si s‑ehbeni ch si hihnk ch hab kaij mo d wabsh kokꞌoi.
<sax> But immediately Jesus said to them, “Don't worry, it's me! Don't be afraid!” ||| D ab hahawa si t‑wui neok ch d Jesus ch hab kaij, “Pi g wo shaꞌi ni‑ehbenid. Dani ahni. Mt oi wo s‑ap e taht.”
<sax> “Lord, if it's really you, tell me to come over to you, walking on the water,” Peter replied. ||| Kud g Peter si s‑kaidam hab kaij ab wui, “Ni‑kownalig, maptp d wo ahpik ch ab wo i ni‑wai. Nt ab wo i hih m‑wui an wabsh shuhdagi dahm.”
<sax> “Come on then,” said Jesus. Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water towards Jesus. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus, “Oi g ab i hihm.”
<sax> But when he saw how strong the wind was, he became scared, and started to sink. “Lord! Save me!” he cried out. ||| D wabshaba am wabsh si s‑gewkam hewed. D g Peter si s‑ehbenid k gam hu wabsh i wachumkahi shuhdagi ch ed k ab si e shoꞌigchud k hab kaij, “Ni‑kownalig, ni‑doꞌibiani.”
<sax> Immediately Jesus reached out and grabbed hold of him, and said, “You have such little trust in me. Why did you doubt?” ||| D ha hekaj am i wuhshad g Jesus k hab kaij ab wui, “Pi apki ab hu si ni‑hiwig.”
<sax> When they got into the boat, the wind died down, ||| D ged hu hahawa e wehm i chehchsh wahlko ch ed. D am waꞌi hekaj huhug g hewel.
<sax> and those in the boat worshiped him, saying, “You really are the Son of God!” ||| Kuchd ab hahawa si has elid ch ab ihm g Jesus ch hab kaij ab wui, “Woho apki d Jiosh alidag.”
<sax> and pleaded with him to let the sick just touch the edge of his cloak. Everyone that touched him was healed. ||| k ab si e shoꞌigchud k ab ahgid mat chum hems wabsh g kahbaj hugidag an wo taht. Kud s‑ap ha doda mad hedai an i taht.
<sax> Then some Pharisees and religious teachers from Jerusalem came to Jesus and asked him, ||| D am haꞌi dada g Palasi ch chehanig ha mashchamdam ab Jerusalem t amjed k ab kakke g Jesus hab kaijch,
<sax> “Why do your disciples break the tradition of our forefathers by not washing their hands before they eat a meal?” ||| “K haschu ahgch g m‑pionag pi ab hu wohog elid g haꞌichu ha‑mashchamadag g kekelibad? Neh, e o gegosid pi am hu t‑himdag oidch ha wapkonk g e‑nohnhoi.”

<sax> Jesus called his disciples over and told them, “I feel really sorry for all these people, because they've been with me now for three days, and they have nothing to eat.

<sax> Jesus replied, “In the evening you say, ‘It'll be a fine day tomorrow, because the sky is red,’  while in the morning you say, ‘It'll be bad weather today, because the sky is red and overcast.’ You know how to predict the weather by what the sky looks like, but you can't recognize the signs of the times! ||| D hab kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Neh, s‑mahch am mat has mahs tash ab wo himad ab wabsh neidch mas hebaijed hewed ch has mahs chewagi i wushke.

<sax> From that time on Jesus began to explain to his disciples that he would have to go Jerusalem, and that he would suffer terribly at the hands of the elders, chief priests, and religious teachers; and that he would be killed, but he would rise again on the third day. ||| D am i amjed am hahawa si tasho t‑ahgi g Jesus k hab kaij, “Hemho wa ant am wo hih Jerusalem wui.

<sax> But to avoid giving offense to anyone, go to the lake, and throw out a fishing line with a hook. Pull in the first fish you catch, and when you open its mouth there you'll find a <span class="it">stater</span> coin.

It's better for you to enter eternal life crippled or lame rather than to have two hands or two feet and to be thrown into eternal fire.  If your eye causes you to sin, pull it out and throw it away.

<sax> Jesus and his disciples went to Jerusalem. As they were getting close, they came to the village of Bethphage on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two disciples on ahead, ||| Kuchd amjed am hihim Jerusalem wui k am ai g Olive Uꞌus Kawulk. D heg mia kihhimag ch hab chehgig Bethphage.

<sax> But they ignored the invitation and left. One went to his fields; another to take care of his business. ||| “T wabshaba idam mam ab ha waid pi ab hu shaꞌi kaiham k gam hu hab wabsh wua g hejel e‑chikpan. Hema at gam hu hih e‑oidag wui. T hema gam hu ep hih e‑tiannaga wui.
<sax> The rest grabbed the king's servants, mistreated them, and killed them. ||| Kut haꞌijj an ha ui idam pion k ha gewittan k ha kokda.
<sax> The king became furious. He sent his soldiers to destroy those murderers and burn down their town. ||| Kut shaꞌi si bagat hegai kownal k am ha cheha g e‑shondalig mat am wo hihim k epai wo ha kokda hegam mat ha kokda g pion k wo mehi g ha‑kihhim. T wa woho hab juh.
<sax> Then the king said to his servants, ‘The wedding banquet is ready, but those who were invited didn't deserve to attend. ||| “T am hahawa i ha wai g e‑pionag k hab kaij, ‘E at nahto g gegosig wehhejed g ni‑alidag hohnta. T wabshaba hegam hemajkam mant ab i chum ha wai hab e juh mo pi d hahawa ha‑wuikam.
<sax> Go into the streets and invite everyone you find to come to the wedding.’ ||| Kumt am wo hihi wohg oidk k ab wo i ha wai gegosig wui mamtp heꞌekia i hemajkam wo ha cheh.’
<sax> So the servants went out into the streets and brought back everyone they could find, both the good and the bad. The wedding hall was full. ||| “Kut am wa woho hihi g piongaj wohg oidk k ab wehs i ha wai hegam mat ha cheh, chum hems g pi ap hemajkam. T am hahawa muꞌi dada. Kumt wehsijj ab ha mah g s‑kehg eniga heg wehhejed k am i ha wahpki. Kut shuhd g kih.
<sax> But when the king came in to meet the guests, he noticed a man who didn't have a wedding robe on. ||| “Kut am i wah g kownal k am ha nei hegam mat am dada. K am hahawa wabsh hema daha g oꞌodham mo pi ab hu wahkch hegai s‑kehg eniga.
<sax> He asked him, ‘My friend, how did you get in here without a wedding robe?’ The man had nothing to say. ||| K ab kakke ch hab kaij, ‘Ni‑nawoj, shahpt masma ia i wah pi ab hu wahkch g s‑kehg eniga id wehhejed?’
<sax> Then the Pharisees left and met together to plot how they could trap him by what he said. ||| Kutsh am i e hemapai g Palasi am i aꞌamich mat has masma wo heki himch g Jesus ab haꞌichu kakkek.
<sax> They sent their disciples to him, together with some of Herod's supporters. ||| Tki am haꞌi i ha wehmt hegam mo ab si has elid g kownal Herod k am ha wehm hihi haꞌi hegam Palasi k am dada k hab kaij, “Ha mashchamdam, s‑mahch ach map s‑ap d oꞌodham ch wabsh chum hedai ha mashcham g Jiosh himdag, chum as has wo chei hedai i.
<sax> So let us know your opinion. Is it right to pay Caesar's taxes, or not?” ||| Pegih, k am wo t‑ahgi maps has elid g geꞌe kownal lial kowlanta. No hig t‑hiwgid g t‑chehanig ahchim Tutuligo matt wo ha namkid aha no pi t‑hiwgid?”
<sax> Jesus knew their motives were evil. He asked them, “Why are you trying to trap me, you hypocrites? ||| D wabshaba g Jesus am wa s‑ha amichud mo g pi apꞌekam hab elid ch hab ha ahg, “Ahpim s‑chu iꞌattomkam am wabsh chum heki s‑ni‑himchudamk.
<sax> Show me the coin that is used to pay the tax.” They brought a denarius coin to him. ||| Ab g wo hema ni‑chehgid hegai lial mam hekaj ha namkid.”
<sax> “Whose image and whose title is inscribed here?” he asked them. ||| D hab ha ahg, “Am g hig wo ni‑ahgid mo hedai wuhiosha ch hedai chehgig ab oꞌohadag id ab lial?”
<sax> “Caesar's,” they replied. ||| D hab kaij idam, “Hegai mo d uhgchu t‑kownalig.”
<sax> When they heard Jesus' answer they were stunned. They went away and left him. ||| Kud si has i el hegam k gam hu hihi ab amjed.
<sax> Well, once there were seven brothers here with us. The first married, and died, and since he had no children he left his widow to his brother. ||| “Pegih, k am hu hebai wewaꞌak d e‑wepngam ch am t‑wehm kih.

<sax> The same thing happened to the second and third husband, right up to the seventh. ||| k hab waꞌap pi ab hu ha aꞌalidt k hab waꞌap muh. Kut ihda g oidchkam hab waꞌap hohnt k hab waꞌap muh pi ab hu ha aꞌalidtk. Neh, t hab masma i e oi idam wewaꞌak k wehsijj koꞌok huhug.
<sax> In the end the woman died too. ||| K am huꞌi hebai, t haha wabsh muh hab wa ehp ihda uwi.
<sax> So when the resurrection takes place, whose wife of the seven brothers will she be, for she married all of them?” ||| Pegih, am g hig t‑ahgid mas hedai d wo hohnigkad ihda matp ep wo e chegito g koꞌi no pi wehsijj hohnigkahim.”
<sax> Jesus replied, “Your mistake is you don't know Scripture or what God can do. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Pi am ap chegito nam pi pi shaꞌi mahch g Jiosh oꞌohana ch ep pi shaꞌi mahch mo heꞌes i gewkdag.
<sax> For in the resurrection people don't marry, and they aren't given in marriage either—they're like the angels in heaven. ||| Woho at ab uhpam wo ha mah g koꞌi g doakag. T wabshaba hahawa pi wo hohontad hab masma mo g anghil pi hohont.
<sax> As for the resurrection of the dead—haven't you read what God said to you, ||| Mosesbad atki an oꞌoha mash wa hab kaij g Jiosh:

<sax> Jesus told them, “ ‘Love the Lord your God in all you think, in all you feel, and in all you do.’ This is the greatest commandment, the first commandment. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus, “Id o d si geꞌe ch baꞌich i si s‑has haꞌichu chehanig:
<sax> While the Pharisees were gathered there, Jesus asked them a question. ||| D am i e hemapai g Palasi. D g Jesus hab ha ahg,

<sax> What a disaster is coming on you, religious teachers and Pharisees, you hypocrites! For you travel over land and sea to make a single convert, and when you do, you make him twice a son of darkness as you are yourselves. ||| “Am am si i e nakog mamt chum hems hemako am wo i wanchkwua pi wohokam e‑himdag ed.

You build tombs as memorials to the prophets, and decorate the tombs of the good,  and you say, ‘If we had lived in the times of our ancestors we would not have joined them in shedding the blood of the prophets.’  But by saying this you testify against yourselves, proving that you belong to those who murdered the prophets! ||| “Em‑shohshon at muꞌi ha kokda g kekelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam.

<sax> You'll hear about wars, and rumors about wars, but don't be anxious. These things have to happen, but this isn't the end.  Nations will attack other nations, and kingdoms will fight against other kingdoms. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places, ||| T g nahnko mahs hemajkam ch jejewed ab aꞌai wo i e checheggia. Mt wabshaba pi wo e totods. Hemho wa at hab wo e juh hab masma.

<sax> Notice that I've told you this before it even happens. ||| Neh, ni heki hu am em‑ahgid mamt hekaj wo s‑e nenꞌoidk.
<sax> So if they tell you, ‘Look, he's out in the desert,’ don't go looking there; or if they say, ‘Look, he's secretly here,’ don't believe it. ||| “Tp hems haꞌi hab wo chei mo am haꞌichug g Jiosh si Kehsha tohono jewed ch ed o am hebai e ehstokch.

<sax> The foolish girls took their lamps but didn't take any oil with them, ||| ch ep pi ha waꞌigchug g a‑saidi.
<sax> while the wise took jars of oil with them as well as their lamps. ||| Hetasp o s‑chu nenꞌoid ch ep ha waꞌigchug g a‑saidi.
<sax> The bridegroom took a long time and all the girls became drowsy and fell asleep. ||| Kut pi oi jiwia g wo ha hohntam. T wehsijj s‑ha kohksimch idam chetcha. T gam hu kohk.
<sax> At midnight the shout came, ‘Look, the bridegroom's here! Come out and meet him!’ ||| “Neh, t am i e ai g eda hugkam g s‑chuhugam. T ab kaida ihda, ‘Ab o him g wo ha hohntam. Oi g wo i hihim k ab wo namkhi.’
<sax> All the girls got up and trimmed the wicks of their lamps. The foolish girls said to the wise ones, ||| T hegam wehst‑mahm chetcha nehnen k i ha kegchud g e‑lalampa.
<sax> ‘Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are going out.’ But the wise girls replied, ||| “K hab kaij hegam mo pi haꞌichu nenꞌoid, ‘Ab g wo i ha t‑mahki g e‑a‑saidiga. Chuhchkim o g t‑lalampa.’
<sax> The other girls came later. ‘Lord, Lord,’ they called, ‘Open the door for us!’ ||| “T am i uhpam dada hegam haꞌi k ab chum shoani ch hab kaij, ‘Ab g si s‑t‑hoꞌigeꞌid k ab i kuhpiꞌoki matt am wo i wahp.’
<sax> But he answered, ‘I tell you the truth: I don't know you.’ ||| ‘Nt wo si shel em‑ahgi mani pi shaꞌi em‑mahch mams hedai wud,’ ch am hahawa si kuh g kihjeg.”
<sax> So stay alert, for you don't know the day, or the hour. ||| Neh, d am i kuhgit g e‑wepogida g Jesus hab kaijch, “Neh, mt wo s‑e nenꞌoidad nam pi pi shaꞌi mahch mant hekid ep wo jiwia.
<sax> It's like a man who went away on a trip. He called in his servants and entrusted them with what he owned. ||| “Bant masma ep wo i wepogi g Jiosh kownaltalig matp hems g oꞌodham hema hasko wo him k ab i ha wai g e‑pionag mat ab wo ha nuhkudach g haꞌichu e‑eniga.
<sax> To one of them he gave five talents, to another he gave two, and to another one, according to their different abilities. Then he left. ||| Hema at mah g hetasp mihl pihsh k hema gohk mihl pihsh k hema ep g hemako mihl pihsh no pi s‑mahch mat heꞌekia i s‑ap wo chikpanad k amjed gam hu mehk jewed wui hih.
<sax> Immediately the one with five talents went and invested them in a business, and made another five talents. ||| “Hegai piongaj mat g hetasp mihl pihsh ab ui at am ha hekaj i e nakog k hekaj ihda lial mat am dahm hetasp mihl pihsh ep nahto.
<sax> In the same way the one with two talents made another two. ||| Kut hegai mat g gohk mihl pihsh ab ui hab waꞌap e juh k gohk mihl pihsh am dahm nahto.
<sax> But the man who'd received the one talent went off and dug a hole and hid his master's money. ||| T wabshaba hegai mat g hemako mihl pihsh ab ui gam hu him k am hebai wagt k am ehsto.
<sax> His master said to him, ‘You've done well—you are a good, faithful servant. You have proved yourself trustworthy over small things, so now I'm placing you in charge over many things. Be happy because I'm really pleased with you!’ ||| “K hab kaij g ahmoj, ‘S‑ap aptki hab e juh, s‑apꞌekam ni‑pionag, s‑ap hekajk mant heꞌekia ab i m‑mah. Nt hekaj ab baꞌich i muꞌi wo m‑nuhkudach.

<sax> The one with two talents also came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘You gave me two talents. Look, I've made a profit of two talents.’ ||| “T heg ab hahawa ep i wah piongaj mat g gohk mihl pihsh ab mah k hab kaij, ‘Neh, gohk mihl pihsh apt wa ab ni‑mah.

<sax> His master said to him, ‘You've done well—you are a good, faithful servant. You have proved trustworthy over small things, so now I'm placing you in charge over many things.

<sax> Then the man with one talent came. ‘Master,’ he said, ‘I know that you're a hard man. You reap where you didn't sow, and you harvest crops that you didn't plant. ||| “T ab hahawa i wah hegai piongaj mat g hemako mihl pihsh ab mah k hab kaij, ‘Ni‑ahmo, s‑mahch ani map s‑ta keꞌidama ch s‑beihimk hegai map haschu pi ab hu chikpan.
<sax> So since I was afraid of you I went and buried your talent in the ground. Look, you can have back what belongs to you.’ ||| Kunt heg hekaj gam hu s‑aꞌagko eꞌesto g m‑lialiga. Neh, m ia wehch mo haschu d m‑eniga.’
<sax> But his master answered him, ‘You wicked and lazy servant! If you think I reap where I don't sow, and harvest crops I didn't plant, ||| “K hab kaij g ahmoj, ‘Si pi ap ch s‑padmakam ni‑pionag, kups wa chum s‑mahch mani s‑ta keꞌidama ch s‑beihimk hegai mani haschu pi ab hu chikpan.
<sax> then you should have deposited my silver in the bank so that when I returned I could have had my money with interest. ||| Pegih neh, pt hems am hi wo wa chum toa g ni‑lialiga wahnko ch ed. Kunt ab wehs uhpam wo ui wehnadk mat haschu ab wo i mahmadt.’
<sax> Take the talent away from him, and give it to the one with ten talents. ||| “K hab hahawa ha ahg g haꞌi ep e‑pionag, ‘Mt wo wohppoꞌid k ab wo mah hegai mo wehst‑mahm mihl pihsh edgid.
<sax> But when the Son of man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his majestic throne. ||| “An ant wo dahiwua ni‑kownal daikud an mant hekid wo i jiwia ha wehm g ni‑anghiliga.
<sax> Everyone will be brought before him. He will separate them from one another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.  He'll place the sheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left. ||| T wehs hemajkam am wo e hemapai ni‑baꞌich.

<sax> Then the king will say to the ones on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, and inherit the kingdom that's been prepared for you from the beginning of the world.  For I was hungry, and you gave me food to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me a drink. I was a stranger and you invited me in.  I was naked and you clothed me. I was sick and you looked after me.

<sax> Then those who are right will answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and fed you, or thirsty and gave you a drink?  When did we see you as a stranger and invite you in, or naked and clothe you?  When did we see you sick, or in prison, and visit you?’ ||| “Kut hab wo chei ab ni‑wui, ‘T‑kownalig, kuchs hekid i m‑gegosid k m‑wasbid k ab i m‑wahki t‑kih ed k ab m‑enigadad k m‑nuhkud k am m‑chechga?’
<sax> The king will tell them, ‘I tell you the truth: whatever you did for one of these of least importance you did for me.’ ||| “Nt hab wo chei, ‘Nt wo si shel em‑ahgi mam ahni am i ni‑wehmt hekid am i ha wehmtch hegam mo d shoꞌigkam ch ab ni‑hiwig.’
<sax> He'll also say to those on his left, ‘Go away from me, you who are doomed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels!  For I was hungry and you didn't give me anything to eat. I was thirsty and you didn't give me a drink.  I was a stranger and you didn't invite me in. I was naked and you didn't clothe me.

<sax> Then they will also answer, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and didn't look after you?’ ||| “Kut hab wo chei hegam ab ni‑wui, ‘T‑kownalig, ch hekid i m‑neid maps d bihugimkam o d tonomkam o d ge oꞌodham o pi haꞌichu eniga o mumku o d lihso, kuchs pi am hu i m‑wehmt.’

<sax> a woman came over to him carrying an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume. She poured it on Jesus' head while he was sitting eating. But when the disciples saw what she did, they were upset. ||| Id ad ab i t‑waid k t‑gegos. Kuchd am dadhak ch t‑gegosid.

<sax> and asked them, “How much will you pay me for betraying Jesus to you?” They paid him thirty silver coins. ||| ash hab kaij, “Heꞌekia amt wo i ni‑namkid mant an wo em‑behi g Jesus?”
<sax> From then on he looked for an opportunity to betray Jesus. ||| Tsh ab i amjed g Judas am i e nako matsh wo gagda g Jesus.
<sax> On the first day of the festival of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked him, “Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you to eat?” ||| D am hahawa s‑ap i e ai hegai t‑shohshonbad ha doꞌibiadag piast.

<sax> The disciples did as Jesus told them, and prepared the Passover meal there. ||| Kud am hab e juh mad hab ha ahg g Jesus k am i apꞌech g gegosig.
<sax> They were extremely upset. One after the other they asked him, “Lord, it's not me, is it?” ||| Kuchd si pi ap t‑taht k gan hu hab i cheꞌiatahi, “Ih, hi wa pi ahni, ni‑kownalig.”
<sax> “The one who's dipped his hand into the dish with me will betray me,” Jesus replied. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus, “Heg at hab wo juh mat hedai am ni‑wehm wo wakch g chemait hidod ch ed.
<sax> “The Son of man will die just as it was prophesied about him, but what a disaster it will be for the man who betrays the Son of man! It would be better for that man if he'd never been born!” ||| Bant masma wo ni‑muhkid mo has masma heki hu oꞌohanas Jiosh oꞌohana ed mat g si Kehshaj wo e muhkid.

<sax> Judas, the one who would betray Jesus, asked “It's not me, is it, Rabbi?” ||| D hegai Judas matki gagda hab kaij, “Aha nap ahni hab ni‑ahg, t‑mashchamdam?”
<sax> While they were eating, Jesus took some bread and blessed it. Then he broke it and gave pieces to the disciples. “Take and eat this for it is my body,” said Jesus. ||| Chd am wabsh kia t‑gegosid. D g Jesus am bei g chemait k ab hoꞌigeꞌel g Jiosh k am hahawa i hahain k ab t‑mah k hab kaij, “Oi g wo huhgi ihda. Do ni‑honshpadag.”
<sax> Then he picked up the cup, blessed it, and gave it to them. “Drink from it, all of you,” he told them. ||| D am hahawa bei g tahsa k ab ep hoꞌigeꞌel g Jiosh k ab t‑mah g wasib k hab kaij, “Wehsijj g ab wo ihꞌe.

<sax> But Peter objected, “Even if everyone else abandons you, I'll never abandon you.” ||| D g Peter hab kaij, “Ahni ant hi pi hekid wo shaꞌi m‑dagito, chum as wehsijj wo m‑dagito idam.”
<sax> “I'm telling you the truth,” Jesus told him, “This very night, before the cock crows, you'll deny me three times.” ||| D hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Nt wo si shel m‑ahgi mat koi wo kuhu g keli chuchul id i chuhug ab. Kupt waikko hab wo waꞌi chei map pi shaꞌi ni‑mahch.”
<sax> “Even if I have to die with you, I'll never deny you!” Peter insisted. And all the disciples said the same thing. ||| D hab kaij g Peter, “Pi ant hekid hab wo shaꞌi chei manis pi m‑mahch, chum anis wo ni‑muhkid m‑wehm.” Kuchd wehsijj hab waꞌap kaij.
<sax> Then Jesus went with his disciples to a place called Gethsemane. He told them, “Sit down here while I go over there and pray.” ||| Kuchd ged hu dada heg ab oidag mo hab e aꞌaga Gethsemane.

<sax> He took Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him, and he began to suffer agonizing sorrow and distress. ||| Bad kaij ch am ha uꞌuk g Peter ch James ch John. T idam gam hu oi.
<sax> Then he said to them, “I am so overwhelmed with sadness that it's killing me. Wait here and keep watch with me.” ||| ch hab kaij ab ha wui, “Ab at wabsh i si ni‑shuhd g pi ap tahhadkam ch si s‑ni‑mukima tahhadchud. Ia g wabsh wo dadk ch wo haꞌichu si nenashanad.”
<sax> He went a little farther forward, fell face down, and prayed. ||| Tsh g Jesus baꞌich ep shaꞌi him k am i gei jewedo k hab kaij ab Jiosh wui, “Ni‑ohg, matp am wo s‑apꞌek, pt im hu hab wo i juh hegai si s‑koꞌok shoꞌigdag mo ab ni‑wui him. Kuni eda tatchua mat ahpi g m‑tatchui hab wo e juh.”
<sax> He went back to the disciples and found them asleep. He said to Peter, “What, you couldn't stay awake with me for just one hour? ||| Tsh am hahawa uhpam ep jiwia ha wui hegam waik. Kush am kohksh. Sh hab kaij ab ha wui, “Pi amtki shaꞌi e nako mamt wo ni‑wehm nenead al hemako ohla ab.
<sax> He went back and found them sleeping, for they just couldn't stay awake. ||| Neh, k am hahawa uhpam ep jiwia ha wui. Kush ep kohksh no pi shaꞌi s‑ha kohksimchud.
<sax> So he left them once more, and went off and prayed a third time, repeating the same things. ||| Tsh gam hu hahawa ep hih g Jesus k heg hab kaij ab Jiosh wui matsh wehpeg
<sax> Then he returned to the disciples, and told them, “How can you still be sleeping and resting? Look, the time has come.

<sax> As he said this, Judas, one of the Twelve, arrived with a large mob armed with swords and clubs sent by the chief priests and elders of the people. ||| Am ad wabsh kia neok.

<sax> Judas came up to Jesus immediately, and said, “Hello, Rabbi,” and kissed him. ||| D am wabsh i chum jiwia g Judas k wabsh shel i hih ab Jesus wui k hab kaij, “Jiosh at wo s‑m‑hoꞌigeꞌel, ni‑mashchamdam!” Neh, bad cheꞌe k ab chintad.
<sax> “My friend, do what you came to do,” Jesus said to Judas. So they came and grabbed hold of Jesus, and arrested him. ||| D hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Ih, ni‑nawoj, oi g s‑hohtam am hab juhni hegai mapt haschu ahgk ia jiwia.”
<sax> Don't you think I could ask my Father, and he'd immediately send more than twelve legions of angels? ||| Aha nap pi mahch mantp ab wo tai g ni‑ohg, t ha hekaj wo ha cheha g shaꞌi si muꞌi mihl anghil mat ni‑wehhejed wo ha cheggia.
<sax> But then how could the Scriptures be fulfilled that say it must be like this?” ||| K wabshaba an hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed mat hemho wa am ni‑tahgio hab wo e juh ihda mo hab e wua.”
<sax> Then Jesus told the mob, “Have you come with swords and clubs to arrest me as if I was some kind of dangerous criminal? Every day I sat in the Temple teaching and you didn't arrest me then. ||| Neh, bad kaij g Jesus ch hab hahawa ha ahg hegam mat an bei, “Wehs tashkaj ani am dahiwup ch ha mashcham geꞌe cheopi t am.

<sax> But all this is happening to fulfill what the prophets wrote.” Then all the disciples abandoned him and ran away. ||| Pegih, bat wa masma an heki hu oꞌoha g kekelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam mant hab masma an wo ni‑behij mat g pi ap hemajkam.” Neh, bad kaij g Jesus.
<sax> Those who'd arrested Jesus took him to the home of Caiaphas, the high priest, where the religious teachers and elders had gathered. ||| Kumtsh am i bei g Jesus heg kih wui uhgchu pahl mo hab chehgig Caiaphas. Tsh eda am heki hu i e hemapai g chehanig t‑mashchamdam ch geꞌeged.
<sax> Peter followed him at a distance, and went into the high priest's courtyard. He sat there with the guards to see how things would end. ||| Sh g Peter ga hu wabsh mehkjed ha oid ch am i wah kolhai ch ed. Sh am haꞌi dadha g ha‑pionag.

<sax> But Jesus remained silent. ||| Kush wabshaba g Jesus pi has shaꞌi kaij.
<sax> “You said it,” Jesus replied. “And I also tell you that in the future you'll see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of the Almighty, and coming on the clouds of heaven.” ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “Dani ahni.

<sax> Then the high priest tore his clothes, and said, “He's speaking blasphemy! Why do we need any witnesses?

<sax> Then they spat in his face and beat him. Some of them slapped him with their hands, ||| Tsh idam ab si siswua wuhioshaj ab k an si maꞌishk wuh g wuhpuij k ab si shonikkash
<sax> and said, “Prophesy to us, you ‘Messiah’! Who just hit you?” ||| ch hab ahg, “Am g hig t‑ahgid mas hedai ab m‑shonikka, ahpi Jiosh si Kehsha e ahga.”
<sax> Meanwhile Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A servant girl came up to him, and said, “You were with Jesus the Galilean too!” ||| Sh eda g Peter am daha kih bahsho. Kutsh am hema jiwia g uwi piongaj g uhgchu pahl k hab kaij ab Peter wui, “Ahpi ap ep wehmaj hegai Jesus.”

<sax> Then Peter remembered what Jesus had told him: “Before the cock crows, three times you will deny knowing me.” He went outside and wept bitterly. ||| Tsh am ha hekaj i chegito g Peter mo wa g Jesus ab wui hab kaij, “Pi at koi wo kuhu g keli chuchul.

<sax> Early in the morning all the chief priests and elders of the people consulted together and decided to have Jesus put to death. ||| Tsh am wabsh i chum mahsi. Tsh am hahawa i apꞌech g uꞌugchu papal ch geꞌeged mat wo e muhkid g Jesus.
<sax> They bound him, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate, the governor. ||| Tsh am i e kuhgit g ha‑namki. Kutsh am si i maniadad g nohnhoij g Jesus k gam hu i wanim matsh am wo i bei heg wui mo d kownal heg eda chekshani ch hab chehgig Pilate.
<sax> When Judas, the one who'd betrayed Jesus, saw that Jesus had been condemned to death, he regretted what he'd done and returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and the elders. ||| Sh eda g Judas an himad ch ha neid. Sh am wanimed g Jesus kownal wui mat wo e muhkid. Kutsh si e tods g Judas k am him k am uhpam i ui hegai waikko wehst‑mahm plahda pihsh ha wui g uꞌugchu papal ch geꞌeged
<sax> “I've sinned! I've betrayed innocent blood!” he told them. ||| k hab kaij, “Tki wo e muhkid hegai mo pi ha chuꞌijig. K d ni‑chuꞌijig nant pi ab em‑wui gagda.”
<sax> Judas threw the silver coins into the sanctuary and left. He went away and hanged himself. ||| Tsh g Judas am si nehnich hegai lial k am shul geꞌe cheopi ch ed k gam hu hahawa wuhsh jeg ed k wabsh hejel e naggia.
<sax> That's why the field is still called today the “Field of Blood.” ||| ch wabshaba hab hahawa e aꞌaga Ehꞌed Oidag.
<sax> This fulfilled the prophecy spoken through the prophet Jeremiah: “They took thirty silver coins—the ‘value’ of the one who was bought at the price set by some of the children of Israel— ||| Neh, id atsh wa hab e juh hab masma mash wa g Jiosh heki hu waꞌi hab kaij matsh hab masma hab wo e juh. Hegai kelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam mash hab chehgig Jeremiah atki an oꞌoha mash hab kaij g Jiosh:
<sax> Jesus was brought before Pilate the governor who asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” ||| Sh eda am kehk g Jesus kownal wui. Sh hegam mo s‑muꞌamk ab abchud mo chum e kownalchud. Sh g kownal ab kakke, “No wa woho mapsh hab chum e elid map d ha‑kownalig idam Tutuligo?”
<sax> But when the chief priests and elders brought charges against him, Jesus did not answer. ||| Sh g uꞌugchu papal ch geꞌeged ab muꞌi haꞌichu abchud. Sh pi am hu has shaꞌi kaij g Jesus.
<sax> “Don't you hear how many charges they're bringing against you?” Pilate asked him. ||| Sh hekaj hab kaij g Pilate ab wui, “Neh, muꞌi haꞌichu o ab m‑abchud. Napt pi ab hu wo ha kaiha?”
<sax> But Jesus didn't say anything, not a single word. This greatly surprised the governor. ||| Kush ep pi am hu has shaꞌi kaij g Jesus. Tsh heg hekaj si has i el g kownal.
<sax> Now it was the custom of the governor to release to the crowd during the festival whichever prisoner they wanted. ||| K am hab e wua ahid ab id eda gegosig mo g kownal hema dadagitod g lihso am ha wehhejed g hemajkam.
<sax> At that time a notorious prisoner was being held, a man named Barabbas. ||| K am hema d lihso ch hab chehgig Barabbas. K wehsijj s‑mahch ihda.
<sax> While he was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent a message to him that said, “Don't do anything to this innocent man, for I've suffered terribly today as a result of a dream about him.” ||| Sh am daha g Pilate lodaita daikud ed. Kutsh eda g wehmaj kihkam heki hu hema cheha matsh am wo him k wo ahgi mo hab kaij, “Pi g am hu has shaꞌi juhni hegai oꞌodham no pi pi ha chuꞌijig. Muꞌi ant haꞌichu nako chuhug chehchkch ab amjed.”
<sax> But the chief priests and the elders convinced the crowds to ask for Barabbas, and to have Jesus put to death. ||| Sh eda hegam uꞌugchu papal ch geꞌeged ab ha chehani g hemajkam matsh ab wo tai g Pilate mat wo dagito g Barabbas k g Jesus hab wo juh mat wo e muhkid.
<sax> When the governor asked them, “So which of the two do you want me to release to you?” they answered, “Barabbas.” ||| Pegih, sh g kownal ab ha kakke mas hedai am wo i dagito ha wui idam gohk.
<sax> “Then what shall I do with Jesus, the Messiah?” he asked them. ||| Sh hab hahawa ep kaij g Pilate mas has wo juh hegai Jesus mo hab e aꞌaga Jiosh si Kehsha.
<sax> “Why? What crime has he committed?” Pilate asked. But they shouted even louder, “Crucify him!” ||| Kutsh hab chum chei g Pilate, “Haschu ahg? Shahchu at hig pi ap has juh?”
<sax> When Pilate saw it was a lost cause, and that a riot was developing, he took some water and washed his hands in front of the crowd. “I'm innocent of this man's blood. It's on your heads!” he told them. ||| Tsh am i nei g Pilate matki heki hu i babgat g hemajkam k am hu wo e cheggia. Tsh am ge was g shuhdagi k am hemajkam ha tahgio i ha wapko g e‑nohnhoi k hab kaij ab ha wui, “Pi o haꞌichu d shaꞌi ni‑chuꞌijig matp wo e muhkid ihda oꞌodham. Ahpim o d em‑chuꞌijig.”
<sax> All the people answered, “May his blood be on us, and on our children!” ||| Sh wehsijj hab kaij hegam mo am haꞌichug, “Ahchim g t‑aꞌaliga ha wehm att ab wo moht g s‑koꞌok namkidadag id hekaj.”
<sax> Then he released Barabbas to them, but he had Jesus whipped and sent to be crucified. ||| Tsh g Pilate am hahawa i dagito g Barabbas ha wui k am ha cheha g shondal mat wo gewitta g Jesus k am hahawa i dagito mat ab wo naggia kots t ab.
<sax> They made a crown of thorns and placed it on his head, and put a stick in his right hand. They kneeled down in front of him and mocked him, saying, “We salute you, King of the Jews!” ||| k ge hoꞌi gihkot k ab wahki moꞌoj ab k g uhs an behijel s‑apko nowij an k wabsh nahnko ahg ch ab i tohtonwua wui k hab kaij, “Tash g d ha‑kownaligk g Tutuligo.”
<sax> They spat on him, and took the stick and beat him over the head with it. ||| Sh ab si siswuimad k an si gewitta moꞌoj an.
<sax> When they'd finished mocking him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him away to crucify him. ||| Tsh am i haꞌasa nahnko juh k am wuahawua hegai kownal eniga k ab uhpam wahki g enigaj k gam hu hahawa i bei mat ab wo naggia kots t ab.
<sax> On the way they found a man called Simon, from Cyrene, and they forced him to carry Jesus' cross. ||| Tsh ab hema i ha nam g oꞌodham mo ab Cyrene kihhim t ab d kihkam ch hab chehgig Simon. Id amtsh ab wabsh si kushwiotach hegai kots mamt ab ab wo naggia g Jesus.
<sax> When they arrived at Golgotha, meaning “Place of the Skull,” ||| Kumtsh gam hu i bei g Jesus mamtsh am wo naggia. K hab e aꞌaga amai Golgotha. K id hab d ahga Koshwak.
<sax> they gave him wine mixed with gall. But having tasted it, he refused to drink it. ||| Kumtsh ab chum iꞌich g nawait mo g kulani am wehnags mat wo hehogi g s‑koꞌok. Tsh ab chum jeh k pi ab hu ih.
<sax> After they had crucified him, they rolled dice to divide his clothes between them. ||| Kumtsh ab hahawa sisish kots t ab k am i kei g kots. Tsh am haꞌi e chichwi g shondal k am aꞌai e gehg g wehschugaj
<sax> Then they sat down and kept watch over him there. ||| k am hahawa i dadhaiwua k nuhkud.
<sax> Those who passed by shouted insults at him, shaking their heads, ||| Sh hegam mo an bihbimhim si gahi e moꞌogid ch ab si s‑koꞌokam has ahg g Jesus
<sax> saying, “You who promised to destroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days, why don't you save yourself! If you really are the Son of God, then come down from the cross.” ||| hab kaijch, “Naptsh woho wo i wua g geꞌe cheopi k am uhpam ep wo kei waik tash ab?

<sax> The chief priests mocked him in the same way, along with the religious teachers and elders. ||| Sh g uꞌugchu papal ch chehanig ha mashchamdam ch geꞌeged hab wa masma ep nahnko ahg hab kaijch,
<sax> “He saved other people, but he can't save himself!” they said. “If he really is the king of Israel, let him come down from the cross, and then we'll believe him! ||| “Id atsh haꞌi ha doꞌibia k atki wabshaba pi wo e nako mas wo hejel e doꞌibia. Nash hig pi woho d t‑kownalig? Pegih, tt ab wo s‑wohoch matp ab wo i huduni k wo e doꞌibia.
<sax> He trusts God so confidently—well let God rescue him now if he wants him, because he claimed ‘I am the Son of God.’ ” ||| Ab o si hiwig g Jiosh ch hab e ahg mo d alidaj. Pegih, tt hig wo nei mas hu wo doꞌibia g Jiosh hemu.”
<sax> The criminals who were crucified with him also insulted him in the same way. ||| Chum wa hema hegam s‑chu eꞌeskam mamt ab hab waꞌap ha nahngia kots t ab hab waꞌap s‑koꞌokam has ahg.
<sax> From noon until three o'clock darkness covered the whole country. ||| T am i dahm juh. T wehsko gei g s‑chuhugam waik ohla ab.
<sax> At about three o'clock Jesus shouted out loud, “Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?” which means, “My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?” ||| Kutsh am i e ai g waik ohla. Sh si s‑kaidam hab kaij g Jesus, “Eli, Eli, lama sabaktani,” mo hab d ahga, “Ni‑Jioshga, Ni‑Jioshga, shahchu apt ahgk am wabsh i ni‑dagito?”
<sax> But the others said, “Leave him alone. Let's see if Elijah will come and save him.” ||| Kush haꞌi hab kaij, “Kia koi, tt hig wo nei mas ia wo jiwia g Elijabad k wo doꞌibia.”
<sax> Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and breathed his last. ||| Kutsh am si s‑kaidam hab haꞌichu ep chei g Jesus k am hahawa i muh.
<sax> Right then the veil of the Temple was torn apart from top to bottom. The ground shook, the rocks split apart, ||| Kutsh hegai s‑kowk ikus kuhpadag mash am s‑tadnim naggia ged hu si eda g geꞌe cheopi ab si shel e wantsh. T g jewed uꞌugij k gam si e hahai g geꞌeged hohodai.
<sax> and the graves were opened. Many of those who had lived good lives and had fallen asleep in death were raised to life. ||| Kutki g hihaꞌini gam si e kuhkpiꞌo. T muꞌijj hegam mat heki hu koi ab s‑wohochudch g Jesus ab i wuwha muhkig amjed
<sax> After the resurrection of Jesus they went out from the graveyards into the holy city where many people saw them. ||| i dahm mat g Jesus i wuhsh k gam hu i wahp amai mo hab e aꞌaga Si Hekia S‑apꞌekam Kihhim ch d Jerusalem. K muꞌijj ha neid amai.
<sax> When the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus saw the earthquake and what happened, they were terrified, and said, “This really was the Son of God!” ||| Tsh idam shondal g e‑geꞌejig wehm am i nei mat g Jesus muh k taht g jewed uꞌujig k shaꞌi si e totodsid k hab kaij, “Woho oki d Jiosh alidag.”
<sax> Many women were also watching from a distance, those who had followed Jesus from Galilee and had supported him. ||| Sh eda muꞌijj am haꞌichug hegam uꞌuwi mo ga hu amjed wehmaj g Jesus ab Galilee t amjed ch am haꞌichukaj i wehmaj. Idam ash ga hu wabsh mehk gegok ch ab neid.
<sax> These included Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. ||| Sh am ha wehmaj g Mary Magdalene ch hegai Mary mo d ha‑jeꞌe g James ch Joses ch heg ehp mo d Zebedeebad wehm kihkam ch d ha‑jeꞌe g James ch John.
<sax> Joseph took the body and wrapped it up in a fresh linen cloth,  and placed it in his own new tomb, cut out of solid rock. He rolled a large stone across the entrance to the tomb, and left. ||| Tsh gam hu uhpam jiwia. Kumtsh am wehhejed ab i huduni g Jesus honshpadag.

<sax> Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb. ||| Kush am dadha g Mary Magdalene heg wehm hema Mary ch am neid mat hebai cheh.
<sax> The next day, after the Preparation day, the chief priests and the Pharisees went together to see Pilate. ||| Baꞌich tash o d shahwai. Tsh am dada g uꞌugchu papal ch Palasi Pilate wui
<sax> They said to him, “Sir, we recall that the imposter said while he was still alive, ‘After three days, I'll rise again.’ ||| k hab kaij, “T‑kownalig, s‑chegito ach mo wa ihda s‑chu iattomkam hab kaij matsh uhpam wo e chegito matsh d wo waik i tashk.
<sax> Give orders to secure the tomb until the third day. That way his disciples can't come and steal his body and tell people that he was raised from the dead, and the deception in the end will become worse than it was at first.” ||| Neh pt am wo ha cheha mat wo si e nuhkud g hihaꞌini waik tash ab.

<sax> “I'll give you a guard of soldiers,” Pilate told them. “Now go, and make it as secure as you possibly can.” ||| Kush hab kaij g Pilate ab ha wui, “Am g haꞌi wo ha uꞌuk g shondal k am has i masma ab wo nuhkud g hihaꞌini.”
<sax> So they went and made the tomb secure, sealing the entrance stone and posting soldiers as guards. ||| Kutsh am ha oi g shondal. Kutsh gam hu hihim k ab si s‑wihnam i kuh g hihaꞌini k an bidsh g hodai k ab si chepos. Sh idam shondal am nuhkud g hihaꞌini tash oidam ch chuhug oidam.
<sax> Early Sunday morning, at dawn, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb. ||| Sh am e aihim g domig tash. Tsh am hihaꞌini wui hihi g Mary Magdalene heg wehm hema Mary.
<sax> The guards shook with fear, falling down as if they were dead. ||| Kutsh wabsh wohoꞌi totods hegam shondal mo ab nuhkud k si gigiwek ch amjed hab sha e juh mo d wabsh koꞌi.
<sax> The angel told the women, “Don't be afraid! I know you're looking for Jesus, who was crucified. ||| Kush ab neok hegai anghil ch hab kaij ab ha wui hegam uꞌuwi, “Pi g am wo shaꞌi e totodsid. M ani wa s‑mahch mam g Jesus chuhkug an chum gahghim.

<sax> Now go quickly and tell his disciples that he's risen from the dead and that he's going on ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there, I promise you!” ||| Kumt am s‑hohtam wo hihim k wo ha ahgi hegam mo am wehmajkahim mat uhpam e chegito k gam hu wo hih Galilee wui. Mt gam hu wo hihim k am haꞌab wo nei.

<sax> Suddenly Jesus came to meet them, and greeted them. They went over to him, held onto his feet and worshiped him. ||| Tsh wabshaba haha wabsh ha nam g Jesus k hab kaij, “T wo s‑em hoꞌigeꞌel g Jiosh.” Tsh ab si i shul wui k an ui tahtdaj an k ab si ihm.
<sax> Then Jesus said to them, “Don't be afraid! Go and tell my brothers to leave for Galilee, and they will see me there.” ||| Sh hab kaij ab ha wui, “Pi g am wo ni‑ehbenid. Am g wo hihim k wo ha ahgi g ni‑wepnag mat am wo hihi Galilee wui k am haꞌab wo ni‑nei.”
<sax> As they left, some of the guards went into the city and explained to the chief priests everything that had happened. ||| Kutsh gam hu hihi hegam uꞌuwi.

<sax> “And if the governor hears about this, we'll talk to him and you won't have to worry.” ||| Kutp wo sha kah g kownal mam has i kaij, tt wo wa em‑doꞌibia.”
<sax> So the soldiers took the money and did what they were told. This story has been spread among the Jewish people to this very day. ||| Kutsh am ui g lial hegam shondal k am hab e juh mam has i ha ahg. Ia o i idani hab masma am e aꞌaga am ha shahgid g Tutuligo.
<sax> But the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go. ||| Kuchd ahchim gamai hemako am hihi heg wui doꞌag am Galilee ch ed mo wa hab kaij g Jesus matt am wo hihi.
<sax> When they saw him they worshiped him, though some doubted. ||| D g Jesus am haꞌichug. Kuchd ab si ihm. D eda hi wa haꞌi sha pi wohoch.
<sax> Jesus came to them and told them, “All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me. ||| D ab si i t‑miabi g Jesus k hab kaij ab t‑wui, “Jiosh at ab ni‑mah g gewkdag wehs haꞌichu dahm an dahm kahchim ch ed ch id dahm jewed.

<sax> Here is the beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God. ||| Id o d s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh ab amjed g alidaj Jesus Christ. Shonaj ihda haꞌichu ahgaj.

<sax> Then Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan River. ||| Kush eda g Jesus wenog ab d kihkam heg eda al kihhim mash d Nazareth ch am eda g Galilee chekshani. Kutsh am i him k am jiwia mo am oimmed g John hab ahgk matsh wo e pahl wako. Tsh g John am pahl wako akimel ch ed.
<sax> As Jesus came out of the water, he saw the heavens split apart and the Spirit like a dove descending upon him. ||| Tsh ab wabsh i chum wuhsh ab amjed g shuhdagi. Tsh g dahm kahchim ab si i e kuhpiꞌo. Kutsh g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag i hud ab ab g Jesus hab sha masma mat g hohhi.

<sax> Right after this the Spirit sent him away into the desert ||| Am waꞌi hekaj, sh g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag hab ahg g Jesus matsh gam hu hejelko wo hih.
<sax> where he was tempted by Satan for forty days. He was with the wild animals, and angels took care of him. ||| Kutsh am hih tohono jewed wui k am haꞌichug giꞌikko wehst‑mahm tash ab mo am haꞌichug g mischini haꞌichu doakam.

<sax> Later, after John was arrested, Jesus went to Galilee, announcing God's good news. ||| Sh am hu hebai, tsh e kuhpach hegai John mo am ha pahl wapkon. Tsh heg i dahm am jiwia g Jesus Galilee chekshani t am am ahgachugch g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh

<sax> They left their nets at once and followed him. ||| Kutsh ha hekaj dagito g e‑chikpan k am i oi.
<sax> He went a little farther and saw James and his brother John, the sons of Zebedee. They were in a boat mending their nets. ||| Tsh am shaꞌi hihim k haha wabsh gohk ep ha cheh. Idam ash am kegchud g e‑chuagia wahlko ch ed ch d James ch John. Kush g ohgaj hab chehgig Zebedee.

<sax> They left for Capernaum, and on Sabbath Jesus went into the synagogue and taught there. ||| Kutsh am hihim k am dada Capernaum kihhim t am. Tsh am i e ai g shahwai mach heg eda t‑mihshmad. Kutsh am i wahp ha‑cheopi ed. Tsh g Jesus am ha mihshmad.
<sax> The people were amazed at his teaching, for he spoke with authority, unlike the religious teachers. ||| Kutsh g hemajkam ab si e totods ab mashchamadaj amjed nash pi baꞌich i si s‑e mamachim ha mashcham mo hi hegam mo d chum chehanig ha mashchamdam.
<sax> Suddenly, right there in the synagogue, a man with an evil spirit started shouting out, ||| Kush eda am hema haꞌichug g oꞌodham mash g jiawul uꞌukch g chegitoidaj.
<sax> “Jesus of Nazareth, why are you bothering us? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are!

<sax> News about him spread quickly throughout the whole region of Galilee. ||| Kutsh an wehsko i e ahgidahi am Galilee ch ed matsh haschu s‑kehg hab juh g Jesus.
<sax> Then they left the synagogue and went to the home of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John. ||| Kutsh ab i wuwha hegam Jesus cheopi t amjed k gam hu wa hekaj hihi ha‑kih wui hegam Simon ch Andrew. Tsh g James ch John ep i ha oi.
<sax> Simon's mother-in-law was sick in bed with a fever, so they told Jesus about her. ||| Kush eda am woꞌo g Simon hohnig jeꞌe ch g s‑tonjigkaj mumku. Kumsh am ahgid g Jesus.
<sax> He went to her, took her by the hand, and helped her up. The fever immediately left her. Then she made them a meal. ||| Tsh am i wah mo hebai woꞌo k ab bei nowij ab k i wamigi. Kutsh ha hekaj am i apꞌet k am haꞌichu ha hihidol.

<sax> The whole of the town gathered outside. ||| k am i e hemapai ha‑kih ab.
<sax> He healed many people who had various diseases, and threw out many demons. He did not permit the demons to speak, for they knew who he was. ||| Kutsh g Jesus wehs ha dodaj idam k gam hu hab i ha juh g jijawul ab ha amjed. Sh g jijawul s‑mahch mo d Jiosh alidag.

<sax> Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up and went alone to a quiet place to pray. ||| Baꞌich siꞌalim mash wabsh kia s‑chuhugam, tsh am i wami g Jesus k gam hu hejelko him k am e hoꞌigeꞌidahun.
<sax> But Jesus replied, “We have to go to the other towns around here so that I can tell them the good news as well—for that's why I came.” ||| Kush hab kaij g Jesus, “Oi g wo. Tt hig wo hihi am baꞌich kihhim wui. Nt am ep wo ha mihshmad nant pi heg hekaj i wuhsh.”

<sax> A leper came to him asking for help. The man kneeled down before Jesus, saying, “Please, if you're willing, you can heal me!” ||| Sh am hu hebai, tsh am hema jiwia Jesus wui k mumku heg hekaj mo hab e aꞌaga ‘leprosy’ ch chum pi ha doajig.

<sax> The leprosy left him immediately, and he was healed. ||| Kutsh ha hekaj doa.
<sax> Jesus sent him away with a strong warning.  “Make sure you don't tell anybody anything about this,” he told him. “Go to the priest and show yourself to him. Give the offering which is required by the law of Moses for such cleansing, so that people will have proof.” ||| Jesus atsh am hahawa si shel ahgid k hab kaij, “Pi g hedai shaꞌi ahgid k wabsh am wo him k am wo i e chehgi pahl wui.

<sax> But the healed leper went out and told everyone what had happened. As a result Jesus could not openly go into the cities anymore, but had to stay out in the country where people came to him from everywhere around. ||| Kutsh oi wa ihda oꞌodham wehsko i ha ahgidahi g hemajkam ab amjed.

<sax> but they could not get near Jesus because of the crowds. So they went up on the roof and took it apart. After they had made an opening above Jesus, they lowered down the mat with the paralyzed man lying on it. ||| Sh wabshaba pi am hu shaꞌi jeg nash pi shaꞌi si s‑hemajkamag.

<sax> That evening Jesus ate dinner at Levi's house. Many tax collectors and “sinners” joined Jesus and his disciples for the meal, for there were many of these people that followed Jesus. When the religious leaders of the Pharisees saw Jesus eating with such people, they asked Jesus' disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?” ||| Tsh am hu hebai i cheka.

<sax> When Jesus heard this, he told them, “It's not healthy people who need a doctor, but those who are sick.

<sax> Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some of them came to Jesus, and asked him, “Why is it that John's disciples and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don't?” ||| Hebaichuj ach heꞌekkio pi t‑gegosid matt ab wo t‑hoꞌigeꞌidahu Jiosh wui.

<sax> But he commanded them not to reveal who he was. ||| Sh g Jesus am si ha chehani mat pi hedai wo shaꞌi ahgi mo hedai wud.
<sax> Then Jesus went away to the hill country. He called those he wanted to be with him, and they came to him.  He chose twelve to be with him, and called them apostles. They were to be with him, and he would send them out to announce the good news, ||| Tsh am hu hebai, tsh ab i chesh g Jesus kawulk t ab k ab i wai hegam mash ab s‑wohochud. Tsh ab wui i hihi.

<sax> Jesus began teaching beside the Sea again. So many people came to listen to him that he climbed into a boat and sat in it on the water while the crowd listened from the shore. ||| Sh am hu i hebai, sh g Jesus am ep ha mihshmad ge shuhdagi hugid an.

<sax> He illustrated his teachings using many stories. ||| Kush muꞌi haꞌichu ha tashogid g wepogida ahgakaj ab amjed g Jiosh kownaltalig.

<sax> They began pleading with Jesus to leave their district. ||| Kutsh ab wabsh si s‑bahbagi i ahgi g Jesus g hemajkam, “Mapt gam hig wo i e mehkod ab t‑amjed.”
<sax> As Jesus climbed into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed begged to go with him. ||| Kush g Jesus an cheshajhim wahlko ch ed. Tsh ihda oꞌodham mash g jijawul uꞌukch ab chum ahgi, “Nt wo m‑oi.”
<sax> But Jesus refused, telling him, “Go home to your own people, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how he has been merciful to you.” ||| Kutsh oi wa pi hiwgid k ash hab wabsh ahg, “Pt wabsh wo wa hih am e‑kih wui k wo ha ahgi g e‑nanꞌaipijju mat haschu si s‑kehg hab m‑juni g Jiosh.”
<sax> So the man went on his way and began to tell the people of the Ten Cities everything Jesus had done for him, and everyone was amazed. ||| Kutsh gam hu hih ihda oꞌodham k gan hu ha ahgidahi g hemajkam amai mash am d Wehst‑mahm Kihhim matsh heꞌes geꞌe haꞌichu hab juni g Jesus.

<sax> Jesus went back again by boat to the other side of the lake where a large crowd gathered around him at the shore. ||| Kutsh an ep dadhaiwua idam Jesus wahlko ch ed k gn hu aigo i chehchsh.
<sax> A synagogue leader, a man named Jairus, came to him. When he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet ||| Tsh ab hema i hih g oꞌodham k d haꞌichu amai ha‑cheopi ed ch hab chehgig Jairus. Tsh ab i hud g Jesus. Kutsh ab wui i gehsh
<sax> A woman was there who had been ill from bleeding for twelve years. ||| Sh eda am hema haꞌichug g uwi ch mumku gamai gohk aꞌahidagkaj. Sh heg wehs oidam g ehꞌedaj chum hekid jegwoni.
<sax> She'd suffered considerably under the care of many doctors, and had spent all she had. But nothing helped her—in fact she'd grown worse. ||| Kush muꞌi haꞌichu nakog ab ha amjed g mamakai ch wabshaba wabsh baꞌich i mumku. Kutsh g lialigaj huhug.
<sax> She had heard about Jesus, so she came up behind him through the crowd, and touched his cloak. ||| Sh am hahawa i kah mash haschu has junihim g Jesus. Kutsh am s‑apkot matsh am wo jiwia wui. Kutsh ab oidk i him k an taht g wehschugaj
<sax> She was telling herself, “If I can just touch his cloak, I'll be healed.” ||| hab e ahgch, “Chum anis hems an wabsh wo taht g wehschugaj, t wo ni‑apꞌet.”
<sax> The bleeding stopped immediately, and she felt her body healed from her disease. ||| Tsh ha hekaj am wabsh si huh g ehꞌedaj. Tsh e taht mat apꞌet.
<sax> Jesus, sensing at once that power had gone out from him, turned around in the crowd and asked, “Who touched my cloak?” ||| Kutsh g Jesus taht matsh g doajig gewkdag sha wuhsh ab ab k am ha hekaj i sikoliwua hemajkam ha wui k hab kaij, “Doht an ni‑taht?”
<sax> “Look at the crowd jostling you. What do you mean, ‘Who touched me?’ ” the disciples replied. ||| Kush hema hab kaij g chuhchaij, “An o si i t‑bihagch g hemajkam. Kup haschu ahgch hab kaij, Doht an ni‑taht?”
<sax> But Jesus went on looking around to see who had done it. ||| Kutsh an i nenhoghim k ab i nei hegai uwi matsh an taht.
<sax> While he was still speaking some people came from the home of the synagogue leader. “Your daughter is dead,” they said. “You don't need to bother the Teacher any longer.” ||| Kush am wabsh kia neok. Tsh am haꞌi dada ab kihj amjed hegai Jairus k hab kaij, “Muh at g m‑chehiaga. Kupt haschu hig ahgk am baꞌich wo i kudu g ha mashchamdam?”
<sax> But Jesus paid no attention to what they said. He told the synagogue leader, “Don't be afraid, just trust in me. ||| Kush wabshaba hab kaij g Jesus ab Jairus wui, “Pi g am shaꞌi has e tahtkkad ch am wabsh i ni‑hiwgad.”
<sax> He wouldn't let anyone go with him except Peter, James, and James' brother John. ||| Bash kaij ch am hahawa ha ui g Peter ch James ch John k am i oi.
<sax> When they arrived at the synagogue leader's house, Jesus saw all the commotion, with people crying and wailing. ||| Kutsh am hihim k ged hu dada mash am kih g Jairus. Kush am wabsh si s‑nakosigam hab e wua no pi si shoani g hemajkam.
<sax> He went in and asked them, “Why are you making such a commotion with all this crying? The little girl isn't dead, she's just sleeping.” ||| Kutsh am i wah g Jesus kih ch ed k hab kaij ab ha wui, “Pi g am wo shoanid. Heg o wa wepo ni‑wehhejed mo wabsh kohsh g chehia.”
<sax> They laughed scornfully at him. ||| Kush wehsijj si s‑koꞌokam ash nash pi s‑mahch matsh heki hu muh. Kutsh gam hu i ha wuhwhasid k am i ha ui hegam mash am wehmaj k am i wahp amai mash am woꞌo g muhki. Tsh g jehjij am ep i ha oi.
<sax> Taking the little girl's hand he said, “<span class="it">Talitha koum</span>,” which means, “Little girl, get up!” ||| Tsh g Jesus ab bei nowij ab k hab kaij, “I wamigi, chehia.”
<sax> The little girl, who was twelve years old, got up immediately and began walking around. They were completely astonished at what had happened. ||| Kutsh ab ha hekaj i wami g chehia k ab i hih. Kutsh si has i e taht g hemajkam.
<sax> On Sabbath he began teaching in the synagogue, and many of those who were listening were surprised. ||| Kush am d i t‑mihshmda tash. Tsh am ep ha mihshmad g Jesus ha‑cheopi ed.

<sax> Isn't this the carpenter, Mary's son—the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? Don't his sisters live here among us?” They were offended and rejected him. ||| No hig pi woho d wabsh hegai huk chikpandam mo d madaj g Mary ch d ha‑wehnag g James ch Joses ch Judas k ch Simon?

<sax> “A prophet is treated with respect except in his home town, among his relatives, and within his own family,” Jesus told them. ||| Sh g Jesus si has i e tahtk ch hab kaij, “Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam at chum hebai ab si has wo e elidad. T wabshaba g si kihꞌamkam oꞌodham ch wehmaj kihkam pi ab hu has wo elidad”
<sax> The result was that Jesus could not do any miracles there, except to heal a few sick people. ||| Kutsh heg hekaj pi e nako mas g si s‑hasig haꞌichu hab wo junihid amai ch heg hab waꞌi juh mat al heꞌekia kokꞌodam ha dodaj.
<sax> He was amazed at their lack of trust. ||| Kutsh am hahawa i ha mihshmdahi g Jesus an wehgaj g Nazareth mo hebai i kihhimag.
<sax> He called together the twelve disciples, and began sending them out two by two, giving them authority over evil spirits. ||| Am hu hebai, tsh am ha cheha g e‑chuhchai matsh goꞌogok e wehm am wo ha mihshmdahi g hemajkam k gam hu hab wo i ha juh g jijawul ab ha amjed hegam mo an ha uꞌukch.
<sax> He told them not to take anything with them except a walking stick—no bread, no bag, and no money in their belts. ||| Neh, bash ha ahg, “Gm amt hu wabsh wo i hihim k heg waꞌi e‑cheowikud wo uꞌad ch pi wo bek g e‑limoshan kostal o g lial o g haꞌichu hugi o g haꞌichu eniga.
<sax> They could wear sandals, but they were not to take an extra shirt. ||| Mt ab wo i em‑wahpkid k wo em‑dagioꞌidad mamt hebai wo i ha mihshmad.
<sax> So they went around telling people to repent. ||| Kutsh wa woho an aꞌai i ha ahgidahi g hemajkam matsh gam hu wo s‑ohhod g pi ap e‑chegitoi.
<sax> They drove out many demons, and healed many who were sick by anointing them with oil. ||| Kutsh ab iawua g huhudakud ha‑mohmi ab g kokꞌodam. Kutsh doda. Tsh muꞌi gam hu hab ep i ha juh g jijawul ab ha amjed hegam mo an ha uꞌukch.
<sax> King Herod got to hear about Jesus since he had become well-known. Some said, “This is John the Baptist risen from the dead. That's why he has such miraculous powers.”  Others said, “It's Elijah.” Still others said, “He's a prophet, like one of the prophets of the past.” ||| An o wa wehsko hab kaidag mash has e junihim g Jesus.

<sax> But when Herod heard about it, he said, “It's John, the one I beheaded! He's come back from the dead!” ||| Sh hegai Herod mo am d wa kownal Galilee chekshani ch ed hab ep kaij, “Doki hegai John mo wa ha pahl wapkonahim. Heg ant mua. Kutki wabshaba uhpam e chegito k hekaj hab e nakog mat hab wo juh g s‑hasig haꞌichu.”
<sax> For Herod had given orders to arrest and imprison John because of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom Herod had married.  John had been saying to Herod, “It's against the law to marry your brother's wife.”  So Herodias had a grudge against John and wanted him killed. But she wasn't able to arrange it  because Herod knew John was a holy man who did what was right. Herod protected John and though what John said was very disturbing to him, he was still happy to hear what he had to say. ||| Ihda Herod atsh wa heg hab juh am wehhejed g e‑hohnig. Heg ash hab chehgig Herodias ch ash d chum hohnigaj g Herod wehnag. Kush heg hab chechgig Philip. Tsh g Herod ehs g hohnigaj.
<sax> Herodias had her opportunity on Herod's birthday. He gave a banquet for the nobles, military officers, and important leaders of Galilee. ||| Sh g Herodias am wabsh nenida mat am wo s‑apꞌet.

<sax> Herodias' daughter came in and danced for them. Herod and those eating with him were delighted at her performance, so he told the girl, ||| Tsh am i wah g uwi madaj g Herodias k am e waila. Kush wehsijj s‑hohhoꞌid. Sh g Herod hab ahg, “Maptp haschu hab wo i elidad ch ab wo i ni‑tai, nt hab wo m‑juni.” Sh pi has shaꞌi kaij ihda uwi.
<sax> “Ask me for whatever you like, and I'll give it to you.” He confirmed his promise with an oath, “I'll give you up to half my kingdom.” ||| Kush hab hahawa ep si kaij, “Maptp haschu ab wo i ni‑tai, nt wo m‑mah, chum as hems eda hugkam g ni‑kownaltalig.”
<sax> The king was very upset, but because of the oaths he'd made in front of his guests, he didn't want to refuse her. ||| Kutsh si pi ap e taht g Herod. Sh wabshaba wehsijj kah mo has i kaij. Tsh heg hekaj pi e nako mas pi am hu hab wo juh,
<sax> So he immediately sent an executioner to bring him John's head. After beheading him in the prison, ||| neh, k am hema cheha g shondal mat am wo him k an wo shonchk g John moꞌo k ab wo i bek.
<sax> the executioner brought John's head on a plate and gave it to the girl, and the young girl handed it to her mother. ||| k am uꞌapa g moꞌoj ab hoas‑haꞌa t ab k ab mah g uwi. Tsh g uwi am him k ab mah g e‑jeꞌe.
<sax> When John's disciples heard what had happened they came and took his body and placed it in a tomb. ||| Kutsh am i kah hegam mo ab si wecho e mashcham g John matsh e muhkid k am hihim k am bei g honaj mat wo s‑ap juh.
<sax> The apostles returned and gathered around Jesus. They told him all they had done and what they had taught. ||| Tsh am i uhpam dada g Jesus chuhchai k am wehs ahgid mat haschu has i juh k haschu ep ha mashcham.
<sax> “Come with me, just yourselves. We'll go to a quiet place, and rest for a while,” Jesus told them, because there was so much coming and going that they didn't even have time to eat. ||| Sh eda iaꞌi idani muꞌi am daiw g hemajkam. Tsh pi am hu shaꞌi ha apkot mas wo e gegos idam Jesus. Sh hab ha ahg g Jesus, “Am att hig wo t‑hejelkod k wo shaꞌi t‑uhꞌulinihogi.”
<sax> So they went by boat to a quiet place to be alone. ||| Kutsh gam hu hejelko hihi g wahlkokaj.
<sax> But people saw them leaving and recognized them. So people from all the surrounding towns ran ahead and got there before them. ||| Muꞌijj ash ha neid mat gam hu hihi ch gam hu ha baꞌich wohp k gam hu heki hu dada. Kutsh idam am hahawa i dada
<sax> You should tell the people to go and buy themselves something to eat in the villages and countryside nearby.” ||| Am g ha ahgid g hemajkam mat gam hu wo hihi kihhim wui k wo ha nolawt hegai mat wo huh”
<sax> But Jesus replied, “You give them something to eat.” ||| Kush hab ha ahg, “Ahpim amt wo haꞌichu ha mah mat wo huh.”
<sax> “Well, how much bread do you have?” Jesus asked. “Go and see.” ||| Sh ab ha kakke, “Shahchu o am i kahch? Am g wo neid.”
<sax> Jesus told everyone to sit down in groups on the green grass. ||| Kush hab ha ahg mat wo ha ahgi g hemajkam mat wehsijj am wo dadhaiwua jewedo heꞌekiajj i e wehm.
<sax> They sat in groups of hundreds and fifties. ||| Tsh am ha cheha. Kutsh am dadhaiwua heꞌekiajj i e wehm, haꞌi am hu i siant k ch haꞌi am hu i hehetaspo wepst‑mahm.
<sax> Then he took the five loaves and the two fish. Looking up to heaven he blessed the food and broke the bread into pieces. Then he handed the bread to the disciples to give to the people, and he divided the fish up between all of them. ||| Kutsh g Jesus am ui hegai haꞌichu hugi k am e dahm i nen k ab hoꞌigeꞌel g Jiosh k am hahawa hahai hegai sismito k ab ha mah g e‑chuhchai. Tsh an i ha mahkhi g hemajkam. Kutsh g waptopi an ep i hahain k ha mah. Tsh an i ha mahkhi.
<sax> Everyone ate until they were full. ||| Tsh wehsijj hug k oi wa hi si s‑kokwod.
<sax> Then they collected up the leftovers of the bread and fish—twelve basketfuls. ||| Kutsh g chuhchaij an i uꞌihim k uꞌapa g wihpiꞌidaj mat am huꞌi gamai gohk hoha wo ha shuhshud.
<sax> Once he'd said goodbye to them he went up into the hills to pray. ||| Tsh g Jesus am ha dagito g hemajkam. Tsh gam hu himto. Tsh am hahawa hejel i chesh kawulk dahm k am e hoꞌigeꞌidahun.
<sax> Late that evening the boat was in the middle of the lake while Jesus was alone, still on land. ||| Tsh am i hud. Sh am wabsh kia hejel haꞌichug. Tsh g wahlko gam hu si eda i cheka g shuhdagi.
<sax> He could see them being buffeted about as they rowed hard because the wind was blowing against them. In the early morning hours Jesus came to them, walking on the water. He would have passed them, ||| Kush g hewel ab si s‑gewkam med ha wui. Sh hekaj pi ap him. Kush s‑ap ha neid g Jesus mash shaꞌi si s‑wihnam himchud g wahlko.
<sax> but when they saw him walking on the water they thought he was a ghost. They screamed out ||| Tsh wabshaba am i nei s‑chuhugam k ed k am si hihnk nash pi si s‑ehbini hab e ahgch mash d wabsh kokꞌoi.
<sax> because they could all see him and were absolutely terrified. ||| Kush hab ha ah, “Pi g wo shaꞌi ni‑ehbenid. Dani ahni. Mt oi wo s‑ap e taht,”
<sax> He went over to them and climbed into the boat, and the wind died down. They were totally shocked, ||| k gan hu hahawa i chesh wahlko ch ed. Kutsh am wabsh si heweto. Tsh idam si has i el
<sax> for they hadn't understood the meaning of the feeding miracle due to their stubborn, hard-hearted attitude. ||| nash ge shaꞌi amichud mokis haꞌas edgid gewkdag. K eda d si s‑hasig haꞌichu mat ha gegos hegam muꞌi hemajkam.
<sax> After crossing the Sea they arrived at Gennesaret and moored the boat. ||| Kutsh ga hu aigo i chehchsh k ab dada amai mo am d Gennesaret k am wulsh g wahlko.
<sax> Wherever he went, in the villages, in the towns, or in the countryside, they put the sick in the marketplaces and begged Jesus to let the sick touch just the edge of his clothes. Everyone who touched him was healed. ||| Kush an oiopo hegam Jesus ch am daiw kihhim ch ed ch oidag ch ed.

<sax> The Pharisees and religious leaders who had come down from Jerusalem to meet Jesus ||| Kutsh ab haꞌi hihi g Palasi ch chehanig ha mashchamdam k am e hemapai an ha wehgaj hegam Jesus. Tsh eda wo chum e gegos.
<sax> noticed that some of his disciples ate with “unclean” (meaning unwashed) hands. ||| Kutsh idam am cheh matsh am haꞌi wabsh dadhaiwua pi hab masma ha wapkonk g e‑nohnhoi mo hab masma d ha‑himdag g kekelibad.
<sax> (The Pharisees and all Jews don't eat until they wash their hands, following the tradition of their ancestors. ||| Ahchim Tutuligo ach muꞌi haꞌichu hab masma hab chum wua mo wa g t‑kekelibadga. K idam Palasi wehs t‑baꞌich i s‑gewkam oid g ha‑chehanig ch pi haꞌichu wo huh pi hab masma ha wapkonk g e‑nohnhoi mash wa g kekelibad.
<sax> In the same way, they don't eat when they return from the market until they have had a wash. They observe many other rituals, like the washing of cups, pots, and pans). ||| Kut g haꞌichu hugi hab waꞌap wo si e wapko mamt hekid ab wo i ui tianna t amjed.

<sax> So the Pharisees and religious leaders asked Jesus, “Why don't your disciples follow the tradition of our ancestors? They eat food with unclean hands.” ||| Kush heg hekaj idam Palasi ch chehanig ha mashchamdam ab kakke g Jesus, “K haschu ahgch pi ab hu wohog elid g haꞌichu ha‑mashchamadag g kekelibad idam mo ab si m‑wecho e mashcham? Neh, e o gegosid pi am hu t‑himdag oidch ha wapkonk g e‑nohnhoi.”
<sax> Jesus replied, “Isaiah was right about you hypocrites when he said, ‘These people claim they honor me, but in their thinking they are far from me.  There's no point in their worship of me, for what they teach as doctrines are merely human rules.’ You disregard God's law, and instead you carefully observe human traditions,” he told them. ||| (8) Kush hab kaij g Jesus, “Kum ahpim haschu ahgch im hu hab wabsh wua g Jiosh chehanig ch im hu haꞌab ab s‑wohochud g ha‑chehanig hegam mo d kekelibad ch d wabsh oꞌodham?

<sax> Then Jesus went inside to escape the crowd, and his disciples asked him about his illustration. ||| Tsh am i ha dagito g hemajkam k im hu wah kih ch ed. Kumsh ab hahawa kakke id amjed.
<sax> “Don't you understand it either?” he asked them. “Don't you see that what you eat doesn't make you unclean? ||| Sh hab kaij, “Pegih, kumtp ahpim hab waꞌap pi amichud. Pi at im hu hab wo shaꞌi i em‑juh ab amjed g Jiosh mamt haschu wo huh
<sax> It doesn't go into your mind, but into your stomach, and then passes out of the body. So all foods are ceremonially ‘clean.’ ||| nat ge am hu wo i wah em‑chegitoi ed k wabshaba ged hu em‑wohk ed wo wah k amjed gam hu wabsh wo wuhsh.”
<sax> It's what comes out of you that makes you unclean. ||| k hab ep kaij, “Heg at im hu hab wabsh wo i em‑juh ab amjed g Jiosh pi ap em‑chegitoi

<sax> Then Jesus left and went to the region of Tyre. He didn't want anyone to know he was staying in a house there, but he couldn't keep it a secret. ||| Kutsh gam hu hahawa hihi hegam Jesus k am dadhaiwua hema kih am mash am miabidch g Tyre kihhim matsh wo shaꞌi e hejelkoch.

<sax> Leaving the region of Tyre, Jesus passed through Sidon and then on to the Sea of Galilee and the territory of the Ten Cities. ||| Kutsh gam hu hahawa hihi hegam Jesus k am gahi wuwha g Sidon kihhim ch Wehst‑mahm Kihhim chekshani k gam hu dada Galilee kahchki am.
<sax> There they brought him a deaf man who also could not speak properly. They asked Jesus to touch the man with his hand and heal him. ||| Kutsh am haꞌi dada g hemajkam k am hema uꞌapa g oꞌodham mash pi chekaidag ch ep pi ap neok k ab i tahni g Jesus mat ab wo taht k wo doaj.
<sax> After Jesus took him aside from the crowd, Jesus put his fingers in the deaf man's ears. Then he touched the man's tongue with spit. ||| Kutsh imhab shaꞌi wuhshad hejelko k am i wahpki g al chuꞌuchum e‑nohnhoi am nahnkaj ed k am hahawa shaꞌi wadagi g e‑nowi g e‑siswuadagkaj k ab hekaj taht g nehnij
<sax> Jesus looked up to heaven and with a sigh he said, “Ephphatha,” which means, “Open!” ||| k am i neh e dahm k si i ihbhuiwua k hab kaij, “Doajini.”
<sax> The man's ears were opened, his speech impediment was gone, and he began speaking properly. ||| Tsh hahawa chekaid. Tsh g nehnij apꞌet matsh s‑ap neo.
<sax> Around this time there was another large crowd that had nothing to eat. Jesus called the disciples together and told them, ||| Kush pi shaꞌi tash amjed.

<sax> “How many loaves do you have?” he asked. ||| Sh ab ep ha kakke, “Heꞌekia at am i wih g sismito?”
<sax> He told the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves of bread, and gave thanks. He broke the bread and handed the pieces to his disciples to give to the crowd. ||| Jesus atsh am hahawa ha ahgi g hemajkam mat am wo dadhaiwua. Kush am dadhaiwua.

<sax> So he left them behind, climbed into the boat, and went back across the lake. ||| Neh bash kaij ch am hahawa ha dagito. Kutsh an ep i chehchsh wahlko ch ed k gam hu aigo ep hihi.
<sax> But the disciples had forgotten to bring bread with them. All they had in the boat was one loaf. ||| Tsh eda pi chegito idam mat wo ui g sismito. Kush hemako am kahch.
<sax> “Watch out—beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and of Herod!” he warned them. ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus am ha wui, “Si g wo s‑e nenꞌoidk mat pi wo em‑cheawuagi g ha‑jewajidakud hegam Palasi ch hegam mo ab si has elid g Herod.”
<sax> “He's saying that because we don't have any bread,” they concluded. ||| Sh hegam chuhchaij am hahawa aꞌaga ch hab kaij ab aꞌai e wui, “Heg oki hekaj hab kaij mach pi ha sismitoga”
<sax> Jesus knew what they were saying, and said, “Why are you talking about not having any bread? Are you still not thinking and not understanding? Have you closed your minds? ||| Kush eda g Jesus s‑ha amichud mo has kaij ch hab ha ahg, “Pi amki koi amichud mani heꞌes edgid g gewkdag ch hekaj am aꞌaga mach pi ha sismitoga.
<sax> You've got eyes to see, haven't you? And ears to hear? ||| Am am wa chum neid mant al hetasp sismitokaj ha gegos g hetasp mihl chechoj ch muꞌi ehp. Pegih, namt pi chegito
<sax> “Do you still not understand?” he asked them. ||| Kush hab kaij g Jesus, “Pegih, mt wo chum s‑mahchk mani heꞌes i edgid g gewkdag ch hab wo s‑amich mani pi heg hab ahg sismito ch wabshaba haꞌichu chum em‑tashogid ch heg am wepogid g jewajidakud.”
<sax> They went to Bethsaida where some people brought a blind man to Jesus. They begged Jesus to touch him and heal him. ||| Kutsh gam hu dada Bethsaida t am k am i huhud. Kutsh g hemajkam am hema uꞌapa g oꞌodham Jesus wui mash pi nea k ab i e shoꞌigch wui mat ab wo taht.
<sax> Jesus took the blind man by the hand and took him outside the village. Jesus spat on the man's eyes and touched him with his hands. ||| Kutsh an bei g pi neadam nowij an k am i wanimed k gam hu i wuhshad ab kihhim t amjed k ab hahawa siswua wuhpuij ab k ab ep taht k ab kakke, “Shahchu ap hig neid?”
<sax> The man looked around, and said, “I can see people, but they look like trees walking.” ||| Tsh ab i nen k hab kaij, “Neid ani mo an oiopo g hemajkam ch wabshaba hab sha mahs mo g uꞌus wuhshanim.”
<sax> So Jesus touched the man's eyes again. He could see properly—he was cured and his sight was clear. ||| Tsh ab ep taht g wuhpuij. Kutsh ab ep i nea. Tsh g wuhpuij am i apꞌet. Sh hahawa wehs haꞌichu si s‑ap neid.
<sax> Jesus sent the man home, and told him, “Don't go back through the village.” ||| Sh g Jesus hab ahg matsh gam hu uhpam wo hih e‑kihdag wui k pi am hu wo kia i wah kihhim ch ed.
<sax> Jesus and his disciples left to go to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples, “Who do people say I am?” ||| Kutsh gam hu hahawa hihi idam Jesus am haꞌi ep ha wui g kihhim am miabidch g Cesaria Philippi kihhim. Kush g Jesus ab ha kakke ch hab kaij, “Am g wo ni‑ahgid, dohꞌo ni‑elid g hemajkam?”
<sax> “Some say John the Baptist, some say Elijah, others say one of the prophets,” they replied. ||| Kush hab kaij, “Haꞌijj o hab m‑elid map d hegai Johnbad mo chum t‑pahl wapkonahim ch haꞌijj hab ep m‑elid map d Elijabad o hema i ehp hegam kekelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam.”
<sax> Then Jesus began to explain to them that the Son of man would suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests, and religious teachers. He would be killed, but three days later would rise again. ||| Neh, tsh am i amjed am hahawa haꞌichu ha mashcha ab e amjed hab kaijch mat hemho wa muꞌi wo e shoꞌigch g Jiosh si Kehsha.

<sax> Jesus explained this to them very clearly. But Peter took Jesus aside and started to reprimand him for what he said. ||| Neh, sh id am si tasho ha ahgid.
<sax> Jesus turned around and looking at his disciples, reprimanded Peter. “Get away from me, Satan,” he said. “You're not thinking as God thinks, but as human beings do.” ||| Kutsh wabshaba g Jesus ab haꞌab i kekiwua ha wui k ab epai si s‑gewkam neo ab wui g Peter hab kaijch, “Pi g shaꞌi ni‑shohbid. Do wabsh hejel hab m‑elida ihda. Kup ab wui kehk g Jiosh hab elida hab masma mo g ge Jiawul.”
<sax> Jesus called the crowd and his disciples over to him, and told them, “If you want to follow me, you must give up on yourselves, pick up your cross and follow me. ||| Sh eda muꞌij g hemajkam an ha wehgaj. Kutsh ab i ha waid k hab ha ahg, “Mamtp am wo s‑oidam g ni‑himdag k hemho wa gam hu wo dagito g hejel e‑tatchui k ahni ni‑tatchui hab wo junihid ni‑wehhejed e shoꞌigchudch.

<sax> What would you give in exchange for your life? ||| Pi o an hu haꞌichug id dahm jewed mas heg hekaj wo e doꞌibia g oꞌodham.
<sax> If you're ashamed to acknowledge  me and what I say among this unfaithful and sinful people, then the Son of man will be ashamed to acknowledge you when he comes with his Father's glory with the holy angels.” ||| “Muꞌi hemajkam at wabsh s‑tahhadam hab wo junihid g pi apꞌekam ch wo pi em‑haꞌichuchudad.

<sax> His clothes shone a brilliant white, whiter than anyone on earth could bleach them. ||| Tsh g wehschugaj hab e juh mash si s‑tondam s‑tohta mo pi hebai haꞌichu hab masma.
<sax> Then Elijah and Moses appeared in front of them as well, talking with Jesus. ||| Kutsh ab haha wabsh i e chehgi g Elijabad ch Mosesbad k am wehmaj neneok g Jesus.
<sax> Peter spoke up and said, “Rabbi, it's great for us to be here! We should make three shelters—one each for you, Moses, and Elijah.”  (He really didn't know what to say because they were all so frightened!) ||| Kutsh si e totods idam Peter. Tsh g Peter wabsh kohsh k daꞌiwuni k hab kaij ab wui g Jesus, “T‑mashchamdam, s‑apꞌe oki mach ia haꞌichug. Tt ia waik wo ha chuhcha g al chechopi matt hekaj ab wo si has em‑el ahpi ch Mosesbad ch Elijabad.”
<sax> Then a cloud covered them, and a voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, the one I love. Listen to him.” ||| Tsh an hahawa si ha ehkaj g chewagi. Tsh g Jiosh neꞌoki ab kaida chewagi t amjed k hab kaij, “Jesus o d si ni‑tatchuidch ni‑alidag. Heg amt ab wo si kaihamad.”
<sax> Then, all of a sudden, as they were watching, there was nobody. Only Jesus was with them. ||| Tsh am hahawa i chum nenhog hegam Peter. Kush hegai waꞌi Jesus hejel am kehk. Sh pi am hu haꞌichug hegam gohk.
<sax> As they came down the mountain Jesus instructed them not to tell anyone what they'd seen until the Son of man had risen from the dead. ||| Sh ab hahawa i huhudkhim doꞌag t amjed. Sh ab si ha chehani g Jesus ch hab kaij, “Pi g am hedai wo shaꞌi ahgid mamt haschu i nei, nt hoꞌip kia am uhpam i wuhsh ab muhkig amjed ahni Jiosh si Kehsha.”
<sax> They kept this to themselves, but they did argue with each other over what it meant to rise from the dead. ||| Kutsh wa woho hab e juh k wabshaba hejel am aꞌaga mas has d ahga ihda mo hab kaij matsh am uhpam wo i wuhsh muhkig t amjed.
<sax> “Why do the religious teachers state that Elijah has to come first?” they asked him. ||| Am hu hebai, sh hab kaij ab wui g Jesus, “Neh, bo chechꞌe hegam chehanig t‑mashchamdam matsh ia wehpeg wo e maskogi g Elijabad. Tsh g Jiosh si Kehsha ia haha wo e maskogi. Pegih, t haschu ahgk pi ia wehpeg m‑baꞌich e maskogi hegai Elijabad.”
<sax> As soon as the crowd saw Jesus they were in total awe, and ran to greet him. ||| Tsh g hemajkam am i nei mo ab him g Jesus k si s‑ap i e taht k ab i wohp k ab nam.
<sax> “What are you arguing with them about?” Jesus asked them. ||| Sh g Jesus ab ha kakke hegam e‑chuhchai mat am waꞌi wih, “Shahchu am ha wehm aꞌaga?”
<sax> One of the people in the crowd answered, “Rabbi, I brought my son to you. He has an evil spirit that prevents him speaking. ||| Kush am hema g oꞌodham hab kaij ab Jesus wui, “Neh, ia ant heki hu chum uꞌapa g ni‑alidag m‑wui no pi g jiawul an uꞌukch ch pi hiwgid mas wo neo.
<sax> Whenever he has a seizure it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and he becomes rigid. I asked your disciples to drive it out of him, but they couldn't do it.” ||| Hebai atp am si has tahtchud ch i wuhppa. K g totshagi i chechshshaj chinij ab.

<sax> “You unbelieving people!” Jesus responded. “How long must I remain here with you? How long do I have to put up with you? Bring him over here to me!” ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus am ha wui, “Shoꞌo waꞌi pi geꞌej g em‑wohochudadag.

<sax> So they brought him to Jesus. When the evil spirit saw Jesus it immediately sent the boy into convulsions and threw him on the ground, where he rolled around, foaming at the mouth. ||| Kutsh ab hahawa i bei wui. Tsh ab i nei g Jesus. Kutsh g jiawul ha hekaj i wua g ali. Kutsh am gehsh k am si banimmed jewedo. Tsh g totshagi i wuhsh ab chinij ab.
<sax> “How long has he had this?” Jesus asked the boy's father. ||| Jesus ash ab hahawa kakke g ohgaj, “K hekid i amjed hab masma ihda?”
<sax> “Often it throws him into the fire to burn him to death, or throws him into water to drown him. Please have mercy on us and help, if you can.” ||| Muꞌikko o waꞌi chum s‑muꞌamk ch am wuhppa shuhdagi ch ed ch am nahda ch ed. Si g s‑ni‑hoꞌigeꞌid k i wuhshad maptp wo e nako.”
<sax> Jesus, seeing that the crowd was closing in, commanded the evil spirit, “Spirit that causes deafness and dumbness, I order you to come out of him and never return.” ||| Tsh eda ab aꞌaijed i wohp g hemajkam an ha wehgaj. Kush hekaj s‑e hohtkid g Jesus ch si s‑kehꞌel g jiawul k hab ahg, “Dagitoni g ali, ahpi jiawul, k pi dahm an hu ep wo shaꞌi uꞌukchid.”
<sax> The spirit screamed and threw the boy into severe convulsions. Then the spirit came out of the boy and left him for dead—to the extent that many of the people said, “He's dead.” ||| Tsh am si s‑kaidam hihin k ab si s‑gewkam e ugij g ali. Tsh am hahawa dagito. Tsh hab wabsh e juh mat muh g ali. Sh g hemajkam hab kaij, “Muh atki.”
<sax> But Jesus took the boy by the hand and helped him up, and he got to his feet. ||| Tsh wabshaba g Jesus ab bei nowij ab k i wamigi. Tsh i wamig k kekiwua.
<sax> Later, when Jesus had gone indoors, his disciples asked him in private, “Why couldn't we drive the evil spirit out?” ||| Kutsh ged hu i wahp kih ch ed idam Jesus. Tsh g chuhchaij am hahawa hejelko kakke, “Tt haschu ahgk ahchim pi t‑nako machs gam hu hab wo i juh g jiawul?”
<sax> “This kind can't be driven out except by prayer,” Jesus told them. ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “Jiawul at heg waꞌi hekaj gam hu hab wo i e juh mamt ab wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahu Jiosh wui.”
<sax> They left and passed through Galilee. Jesus didn't want anyone to know where he was ||| Tsh amjed gam hu hahawa hihim k gam hu gahi wuwha g Galilee chekshani. Tsh g Jesus pi am hu e chehgi hemajkam ha wui no pi ha mashchamahim g e‑chuhchai ch hab ha ahg,
<sax> because he was teaching his disciples. “The Son of man will be betrayed to human authorities,” he told them. “They will kill him, but three days later he will rise again.” ||| “E o aihim mat g s‑ni‑kehꞌiddam wo ni‑bei ahni Jiosh si Kehsha k am wo ni‑dagito haꞌi ha wui mat wo ni‑mua. Nt wabshaba ep wo ni‑chegito mat d wo i waik tashk amjed.”
<sax> They didn't understand what he meant and were too afraid to ask him about it. ||| Sh oi wa pi shaꞌi amichud mas haschu hab ahg ch wabshaba pi ab hu kakke nat pi e totods.
<sax> Jesus sat down and called the twelve disciples together. “If anyone wants to be first, he has to be the very last, the servant of everyone else,” he told them. ||| Kutsh am i dahiwua g Jesus k ab i ha wai. Tsh am i e hemapai wui. Kush hab ha ahg, “Pi g wo chum ge e haꞌichuchudad mamtp hedai d wo uhgchuk am e‑shahgid ch wabshaba hab wo e junihid mamt wehs d wo ha‑pionagk.”
<sax> He took a small child and had the child stand right in the middle of them. Then he picked up and hugged the child, and told them, ||| Sh am hema kehk g ali. Kutsh g Jesus an be k am kohm k hab kaij,
<sax> “Whoever welcomes a child like this in my name, welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me doesn't welcome me but the One who sent me.” ||| “Matp hedai hema wo ha dagioꞌidad g ali am ni‑wehhejed ch hekaj am wo e chehgidch mo ab si ni‑tatchua ch ab ep si tatchua hegai mani d kehshaj.”
<sax> John said to Jesus, “Rabbi, we saw someone driving out demons in your name. We tried to stop him because he wasn't one of us.” ||| Kush g John hab kaij ab wui g Jesus, “Hema oki gam hu hab i ha wua g jijawul heg hekaj m‑chehgig. Kuch am chum shohbid no ge m‑wecho e mashcham.”
<sax> “Don't stop him,” Jesus replied. “For no one who is doing miracles in my name can curse me at the same time. ||| Kush hab ha ahg, “Pi g am wo shaꞌi shohbid. Pi at woho has wo ni‑ah matp hedai hekaj g ni‑chehgig ch hab wua g s‑wihnk haꞌichu.
<sax> Anyone who is not against us is for us. ||| Tki wo i t‑wehmt hegai matp hedai pi ab hu t‑wui kehk.
<sax> Anyone who gives a cup of water to you in my name, because you belong to Christ, won't lose their reward, believe me. ||| Nt wo si shel em‑ahgi matp hedai wo i em‑wasibi g shuhdagi ahpim mam ab si ni‑wecho e mashcham k wo bei g s‑apꞌekam e‑namkidadag.”
<sax> But if anyone leads one of these little ones who trust in me into sin, it would be better for them if they were thrown into the sea with a large millstone tied around their neck. ||| Sh hab ep kaij g Jesus, “Shoꞌo waꞌi si s‑ta ehbidam hab mahs am wehhejed hegai matp hedai hema am wo i ha wanchkwua pi apꞌekam wui idam al aꞌal mo ab al ni‑hiwig.

<sax> Jesus left Capernaum and went to the region of Judea and Transjordan. Once again people flocked to see him, and he was teaching them like he always did. ||| Tsh amjed gam hu hihi hegam Jesus k am gahi wuwha g Judea chekshani k am gahi i shul g Jordan akimel k gam hu aigo dada.

<sax> Some Pharisees came to see him. They tried to test him by asking the question, “Is divorce legal?” ||| Kutsh ab haꞌi i hihi g Palasi k ab haꞌichu chum s‑abchudamk g Jesus ch ash ab kakke, “No hiwgid g t‑chehanig mat g oꞌodham wo s‑ohhod g e‑hohnig?”

<sax> Then Jesus told them, “Moses only wrote down this rule for you because of your hard-hearted attitude. ||| Kush oi wa hab kaij g Jesus, “Heuꞌu, bo chuꞌig mamt wo ha mah g ohhoda tapial mamtp pi ab hu wo kaihamad g Jiosh ch pi wo pihk e elidad ha hekaj.
<sax> However, in the beginning, from creation, God made male and female. ||| K wabshaba ged hu i shohshonkam am ahgas:
<sax> When they were back indoors, the disciples began asking him about this. ||| Tsh ged hu hahawa i wahp kih ch ed. Tsh g chuhchaij ab i kakke mas haschu hab ahg.

<sax> But when Jesus saw what they were doing, he became very upset and told them, “Let the children come to me! Don't stop them, for the kingdom of God belongs to those who are like these children. ||| Kutsh oi wa pi hohhoꞌi g Jesus matsh chum pi ha hiwigi k hab ha ahg, “Ab g wabsh wo i ha hiwgid g al aꞌal mat ab wo i hihi ni‑wui k pi an hu wo shaꞌi ha shohbi.

<sax> I tell you the truth, anyone who doesn't welcome the kingdom of God like a child won't enter it.” ||| Nt wo si shel em‑ahgi mamt hab waꞌi masma am wo i wahp.”
<sax> He hugged the children, placed his hands on them, and blessed them. ||| Neh, bash kaij ch an i ha kohmkahim k ab i ha tahtamahi ha‑mohmi ab k ab i s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌel.
<sax> As Jesus set out on his journey, a man came running over and kneeled down before Jesus. “Good teacher, what should I do to make sure I have eternal life?” he asked. ||| Kutsh amjed haha wabsh i chum hihi.

<sax> “I tell you the truth,” Jesus replied, “anyone who has left behind their home or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands because of me, and for the sake of the good news,  will receive in return in due course a hundred times as many homes and brothers and sisters and children and lands—as well as persecution. In the world to come they will receive eternal life. ||| Kush hab kaij g Jesus, “Nt wo si shel em‑ahgi mamt baꞌich i muꞌi haꞌichu wo edagi mo chum hegai mam tp haschu i dagito am ni‑wehhejed, kihki, wepnag, jehj, aꞌal, oꞌoidag.

<sax> Bartimaeus jumped up, threw off his coat, and rushed over to Jesus. ||| Kutsh heg am ha hekaj si wuahawua g e‑lihwa k am si daꞌiwuni k ab i him k am jiwia wui.
<sax> “What do you want me to do for you?” Jesus asked him. ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus, “Shahchu ant hab wo m‑juni?”

<sax> So the man sent another servant. They hit him over the head and abused him. ||| “K am hu i hebai, t am hema ep cheha e‑pionag mat am wo hih. T am him k am jiwia. Kut am hab waꞌi ep juh mat hab juh g wehpegkam k s‑koꞌokam juh g moꞌoj k s‑koꞌokam has ah.
<sax> He sent another servant, and this one they killed. He sent many other servants, and they beat some of them and killed others. ||| “T g enigakam am hema ep cheha g e‑pionag mat am wo hih.

<sax> So they took him and killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard. ||| Kut hab juh k muꞌa k gam hu daꞌich ab kolhai amjed.
<sax> The Jewish leaders tried to have him arrested because they realized that the illustration was directed at them, but they were afraid of the crowd.

<sax> They arrived and said, “Teacher, we know you are a truthful person and you don't look for approval, because you don't care about status or position. Instead you teach God's way in accordance with the truth. So is it right to pay tribute to Caesar or not? ||| Kutsh am dada wui k hab kaij, “Ha mashchamdam, s‑mahch ach map s‑ap d oꞌodham ch wabsh chum hedai ha mashcham g Jiosh himdag, chum as has wo chei hedai i.

<sax> They gave him a coin. “Whose is this image, and whose inscription?” Jesus asked them. “Caesar's,” they replied. ||| Kumtsh ab hema chehgi.
<sax> “Then give back to Caesar what belongs to him, and give back to God what belongs to him,” Jesus told them. They were amazed at his reply. ||| Kush hab hahawa ep kaij g Jesus ab ha wui, “Pegih, ab g wo i dagito kownal wui hegai matp d enigaj k am epai wo i dagito Jiosh wui mo haschu d epai enigaj.” Kutsh wehsijj si has i el g neꞌokij.

<sax> Then a poor widow came along and put in just two small coins. ||| Tsh am hema jiwia g hejel wiꞌikam oks k am hi wa al toa g gohk s‑wepegchu.
<sax> He called his disciples together and told them, “I tell you the truth: this poor widow has put in more than all the rest together.

She put in all she had to live on.” ||| Sh g Jesus am ha ahgid g e‑chuhchai, “Nehꞌe, hegam mo haꞌichu s‑edgid o hi wa baꞌich i mumuꞌi am toꞌaw.

<sax> I tell you the truth: wherever the good news is spread in the world, people will remember what she did.” ||| Nt wo si shel em‑ahgi mat am wo e ahgahid mat haschu has ni‑juni mat hebai wo i e ahgahid g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh.”
<sax> Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, went to the chief priests and arranged to betray Jesus to them. ||| Kutsh am ha hekaj ha dagito g Judas Iscariot k gam hu hih uꞌugchu papal ha wui hab ahgk matsh hegam ha wui wo gagda g Jesus.
<sax> When they heard this, they were delighted, and promised to pay him. So Judas began to look for an opportunity to betray Jesus. ||| Sh am si s‑hohhoꞌid ch kah idam mash has i kaij, ash ab si ahgid matsh wo namkid. Kutsh am hahawa si i e nako g Judas matsh hebai wo s‑apꞌek. Kutsh ab ha wui wo gagda.
<sax> On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the time when the Passover lamb is sacrificed, Jesus' disciples asked him, “Where do you want us to go and prepare the Passover meal for you?” ||| T am hahawa s‑ap i e ai hegai t‑shohshonbad ha‑doꞌibiadag piast.

<sax> He sent two of his disciples, telling them, “Go into the city and there you'll meet a man carrying a water pot. Follow him, ||| Kutsh am hahawa gohk hab ha ah, “Am amt wo hihi Jerusalem wui. T ab hema wo himad g cheoj ch wo waꞌigchugad ab haꞌa t ab.
<sax> and when he goes into a house, ask the owner where I and my disciples can celebrate the Passover. ||| Kumt am wo i oi. T am hu hebai wo him k am wo i wah hema kih ed.

<sax> In the evening Jesus went there with the twelve disciples. ||| Tsh am i hud. Tsh am hahawa dada hegam Jesus k am hu dadhaiwua k e gegosid.
<sax> While they were sitting eating, Jesus said, “I tell you the truth: one of you is going to betray me; one who is eating with me now.” ||| Sh hab haha wabsh kaij g Jesus, “M ant wo si shel em‑ahgi mat oi am hab wo e juh mamt hema wo ni‑gagda ahpim mam ab si ni‑wecho e mashcham.”
<sax> They were shocked, and they each asked, “It's not me, is it?” ||| Kutsh wehsijj pi ap e taht k gan hu hab i cheꞌiatahi, “Ih, hi wa pi ahni.”
<sax> “It's one of the Twelve, one of you sharing this food with me,” he replied. ||| Kush hab kaij g Jesus, “Heg at hab wo juh mat hedai am ni‑wehm wo wakch g chemait hidod ch ed.
<sax> “The Son of man will die, just as the Scriptures predicted. But how terrible it will be for the man who betrays the Son of man! It would be better for that man if he'd never been born.” ||| Bant masma wo ni‑muhkid mo has masma heki hu oꞌohanas Jiosh oꞌohana ed mat g si Kehshaj wo e muhkid.

<sax> As they were eating, Jesus picked up some bread. He blessed it, and gave it to them. “Take it. This is my body,” he told them. ||| Sh am wabsh kia e gegosid. Tsh g Jesus am bei g chemait k ab hoꞌigeꞌel g Jiosh k am hahawa i hahain k an i ha mah k hab kaij, “Oi g wo huhgi ihda. Do ni‑honshpadag.”
<sax> Then he picked up the cup. He blessed it, and gave it to them. They all drank from it. ||| Tsh am hahawa bei g tahsa k ab ep hoꞌigeꞌel g Jiosh k ab ha mah. Kutsh wehsijj ab ih.
<sax> “This is my blood,” he told them, “the covenant that's being poured out for many. ||| Kush hab ha ahg, “Do ni‑ehꞌed ihda nawait. Id ani hab ahgch hab kaij mant wo ni‑muhkid am em‑wehhejed. T g ni‑ehꞌed wo e iawua. T g Jiosh heg hekaj am hab wo juh hegai mo wa hab kaij matsh hab wo em‑juni.
<sax> “All of you will abandon me,” Jesus told them. “For as the Scriptures say, ‘I will attack the shepherd, and the sheep will be completely scattered.’ ||| Kush hab ha ahg g Jesus, “An o oꞌohanas mo hab kaij g Jiosh:
<sax> “I won't abandon you even if everyone else does,” Peter replied. ||| Kush g Peter hab kaij, “Ahni ant hi pi hekid wo shaꞌi m‑dagito, chum as wehsijj wo m‑dagito idam.”
<sax> Jesus answered him, “I tell you the truth that today, this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny that you even know me three times.” ||| Sh hab kaij g Jesus ab wui, “Nt wo si shel m‑ahgi mat koi gokko wo kuhu g chuchul id i chuhug ab, kupt eda heki hu waikko hab wo waꞌi chei map pi shaꞌi ni‑mahch.”
<sax> But Peter was totally adamant, saying, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you.” All of them said the same. ||| Kutsh am wa si e gewkai g Peter, ash hab si kaij, “Pi ant hekid hab wo shaꞌi chei manis pi m‑mahch, chum anis wo ni‑muhkid m‑wehm.” Kush wehsijj hab waꞌap kaij.
<sax> They arrived at a place called Gethsemane, where Jesus told his disciples, “Sit here while I go and pray.” ||| Kutsh ged hu dada heg ab oidag mo hab e aꞌaga Gethsemane. Sh pi am hu ha wehmaj g Judas Iscariot. Kush hab ha ahg g Jesus, “Ia g hu wo i dadhak. Nt ahni am baꞌich wo i him k wo ni‑hoꞌigeꞌidahu.”
<sax> He took Peter, James, and John with him. He began to be very disturbed and troubled. ||| Bash kaij ch am ha uꞌuk g Peter ch James ch John. Tsh idam gam hu oi.
<sax> Jesus told them, “My agony is so painful it feels like I'm dying. Please, remain here and stay awake.” ||| ch hab kaij ab ha wui, “Ab at wabsh i si ni‑shuhd g pi ap tahhadkam ch s‑ni‑mukima tahhadchud. Ia g wabsh wo dadk ch wo haꞌichu si nenashanad.”
<sax> He went a little farther on and then fell to the ground. He prayed, asking to be spared the time that was coming, if it were possible. “Abba, Father! You can do everything,” he said. “Please, take this cup of suffering away from me. Yet it's not what I want, but what you want.” ||| Tsh g Jesus gam hu hahawa him k am i gei jewedo k hab kaij ab Jiosh wui, “Ni‑ohg, wehs haꞌichu o pi shaꞌi hasig am m‑wehhejed.

<sax> He left them once more, and prayed, saying the same things. ||| Bash kaij ch amjed gam hu hahawa ep him k heg hab kaij ab Jiosh wui matsh wehpeg
<sax> Then he returned, and again he found them sleeping because they couldn't keep their eyes open.  They didn't know what to say! ||| ch am hahawa uhpam ep jiwia ha wui. Kush ep si kohksh ch pi shaꞌi nenashani ch pi shaꞌi mahch mas has wo chei ab wui.
<sax> He returned a third time, and asked them, “Are you still asleep? Are you still resting? Well that's enough, because the time has come! Look, the Son of man is about to be betrayed into the hands of sinners. ||| Ash d i waikkokam, tsh am ep jiwia ha wui. Kush ep si kohksh. Kush hab kaij, “Kumtki ep kohk k e uhꞌulinihogid.

<sax> Get up! Let's go! See, here comes my betrayer.” ||| Oi g wo wahpamigi. Tt wo hihi. Neh, ia at hu jiwia hegai mat ni‑gagda.”
<sax> Just as he was saying this, Judas—one of the twelve disciples—arrived with a mob carrying swords and clubs, sent by the chief priests, religious leaders, and elders. ||| Sh am wabsh kia neok. Tsh am jiwia g Judas. Kush shaꞌi si muꞌijj am wehmaj haꞌijj g iꞌis‑papayo uhꞌukch ch haꞌijj g uꞌus.

<sax> Now the betrayer had arranged a sign with them: “He's the one that I kiss. Arrest him, and take him away under guard.” ||| Kush eda g Judas heki hu ha ahgid idam mo am wehmaj matsh ab wo chintad g Jesus kahmaj ab. Tsh hab masma wo s‑mahchk mat hedai an wo bei.
<sax> Judas went right up to Jesus. “Rabbi,” he said, and kissed him affectionately. ||| Tsh am wabsh i chum jiwia g Judas k wabsh shel i hih ab Jesus wui k hab kaij, “Ni‑mashchamdam.” Neh, bash kaij ch ab chintad.
<sax> So they grabbed hold of Jesus and arrested him. ||| Tsh ab haꞌi hihim k an bei g Jesus k gan hu si s‑wihnam uꞌukch.
<sax> Then all Jesus' disciples deserted him and ran away. ||| Kutsh am hahawa wehsijj wabsh i dagito hegam chuhchaij k gam hu si aꞌai wohp.
<sax> (One of his followers was a young man who was wearing only a linen garment. ||| Sh an hema oidahim g Jesus ch d wabsh wechij oꞌodham ch heg waꞌi sawanokaj e hobinodch. Kutsh an chum bei g shondal.
<sax> They seized hold of him, but he ran off naked, leaving the garment behind.) ||| Tsh am wabsh i dagito g e‑sawano k gam hu si meh ab wabsh i s‑dahpkch.
<sax> They took Jesus to the high priest's house where all the chief priests, elders, and religious teachers had gathered. ||| Kumtsh am i bei g Jesus heg kih wui uhgchu pahl. Kush eda am e hemapdahim g uꞌugchu papal ch geꞌeged ch chehanig t‑mashchamdam.
<sax> Peter followed him at a distance, and went into the courtyard of the high priest's house. He sat down with the guards and warmed himself by the fire. ||| Sh g Peter ga hu wabsh mehkjed ha oid ch am i wah kolhai ch ed. Sh am ge nahdch g shondal. Kush am ha wehm e huhkalid g Peter.
<sax> Inside the chief priests and the whole governing council were trying to find some evidence to have Jesus put to death, but they couldn't find anything. ||| Kush eda idam e jehnigiddam am i chum haꞌichu gahg mat ab wo abch g Jesus mat heg hekaj wo mua.
<sax> Many were giving false testimony against him, but their statements didn't agree. ||| Muꞌijj ash ab haꞌichu chum abchud mash pi shaꞌi woho ch oi wa pi shaꞌi e wepo haꞌichu ahg.
<sax> Some of them got up to speak falsely against Jesus. ||| Kutsh am hahawa haꞌi gegokiwua k hab kaij,
<sax> Then the high priest stood up in front of the council, and asked Jesus, “Have you nothing to say in response to these charges made against you?” ||| Kutsh g si uhgchu pahl am i kekiwua ha shahgid k ab kakke g Jesus, “Napt pi am hu has wo shaꞌi chei id amjed mo haschu ab m‑abchud idam?”
<sax> But Jesus remained silent and didn't answer. So the high priest asked again, “Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?” ||| Kush oi wa pi am hu has shaꞌi ha kaij g Jesus.
<sax> “I am,” Jesus replied, “and you will see the Son of man sitting on the right of the Mighty One, and coming with the clouds of heaven.” ||| Kush hab kaij g Jesus, “Dani ahni. T g Jiosh am wo e chehgi mo ab si has ni‑elid an s‑apkojed e‑hugid an ni‑dahshk e‑kownal daikud ed. T ab wo i e ai mant ab wo i hud chewagi ch ed k am ep wo jiwia jewed dahm. Kumt wehsijj wo s‑mai mani d Jiosh si Kehsha.”
<sax> The high priest tore his clothes and asked, “Why do we need any more witnesses? ||| Kutsh g uhgchu pahl ab si wantsh g e‑eniga hab elidch mo pi ap neok k hab kaij, “Pi ach hedai ep shaꞌi tatchua mas am wo ah g chuꞌijigaj.
<sax> You have heard the blasphemy! What's your reaction?” ||| Am am wa kah g pi kehg neꞌokij. Shahm i elid?”
<sax> Then some of them began to spit on him. They blindfolded him, hit him with their fists, and said, “Why don't you prophesy then, you ‘Prophet’!” The guards took him away and beat him up. ||| Kutsh haꞌijj ab si siswuimad g Jesus. Mtsh ab hahawa si maꞌishk wuh g wuhpuij k ab si shonikkash ch hab ahg, “Am g hig t‑ahgid mas hedai ab m‑shonikka.” Tsh g shondal am hahawa be k ab si s‑kapnim shonikkash.
<sax> Meanwhile Peter was down below in the courtyard. One of the high priest's servant-girls passed by, ||| Sh eda g Peter am daha kih bahsho. Kutsh am hema jiwia g uwi piongaj g uhgchu pahl.
<sax> and seeing Peter warming himself, looked straight at him and said, “You were with Jesus of Nazareth too!” ||| Sh am daha g Peter ch e huhkalid. Tsh id ab si i neid k hab kaij, “Ahpi ap ep wehmaj hegai Jesus.”
<sax> Once more Peter denied it. A little while later they said to Peter again, “You're definitely one of them because you're a Galilean too!” ||| Kutsh ep pi e edagi g Peter.
<sax> Peter began calling down curses on himself and he swore, “I don't know this man who you're talking about.” ||| Kutsh g Peter am ha hekaj si ha ahgi, “Pi ani shaꞌi mahch ihda oꞌodham mam an aꞌaga. T g Jiosh wo si ni‑jehkaꞌich mantp em‑iattogid.”
<sax> Immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Then Peter remembered what Jesus had said to him: “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times.” When he realized what he'd done, he burst into tears. ||| Kutsh am ha hekaj gokko kuhu g keli chuchul. Tsh g Peter am wabsh si i chegito mash wa hab kaij g Jesus, “Koi at gokko wo kuhu g chuchul kupt eda heki hu waikko hab wo chei map pi shaꞌi ni‑mahch.” Tsh wabsh wohoꞌi pi ap e taht k s‑jupij shoak.
<sax> Early the next morning, the chief priest, elders, and religious teachers—the whole governing council—came to a decision. They had Jesus bound and sent him to be handed over to Pilate. ||| Tsh am wabsh i chum mahsi. Tsh am ep e nam hegam uꞌugchu papal ch geꞌeged ch chehanig t‑mashchamdam mo d e jehnigiddam k atsh am i mamche mat has hahawa ep wo e juh. Tsh am i kuhgit g ha‑namki. Kutsh am si maniadad g Jesus nohnhoi k gam hu be k am uꞌapa heg wui mo d kownal ch hab chehgig Pilate ab abchudch mo chum e kownalchud.
<sax> Pilate asked him, “Are you the King of the Jews?” ||| Kush ihda Pilate ab kakke g Jesus, “No wa woho mapsh hab chum e elid map d ha‑kownalig idam Tutuligo hemajkam?”
<sax> The chief priests kept on making many accusations against him. ||| Sh g uꞌugchu papal muꞌi haꞌichu ab abchud. Sh pi am hu has shaꞌi kaij g Jesus.
<sax> Pilate questioned him again, “Aren't you going to answer? See how many charges they're bringing against you!” ||| Sh g Pilate ab ep kakke, “Neh, muꞌi haꞌichu o ab m‑abchud. Napt pi am hu has wo shaꞌi chei ab amjed?”
<sax> But Jesus didn't give any more answers, much to Pilate's surprise. ||| Kush ep pi am hu has shaꞌi ha kaij g Jesus. Tsh g Pilate si has i e taht heg hekaj.
<sax> The crowd went to Pilate and asked him to release a prisoner following his usual custom. ||| Kutsh g hemajkam ab i kakke g Pilate matsh am hab hig wo ha juni hegai mash chum hekid am hab ha wuijid.
<sax> “Do you want me to release to you the King of Jews?” he asked them, ||| Sh g Pilate ab ha kakke, “Pegih, nam hab elid mant id am wo i dagito am em‑wehhejed mash d em‑kownalig?” nash pi chum s‑dagitoimk g Jesus
<sax> for he realized that it was because of their jealousy of Jesus that the chief priests had handed Jesus over to him. ||| ch hab ha elid mo d waꞌi idam uꞌugchu papal ch s‑hehgamk ch s‑muꞌamk.
<sax> But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release Barabbas to them instead. ||| Kutsh wabshaba g uꞌugchu papal am i ha cheha g hemajkam matsh hab wo chei matsh g Barabbas wo e dagito. Kutsh wa woho am hab e juh.
<sax> “Then what should I do with the one you call the King of the Jews?” he asked them. ||| Kush hab ep kaij g Pilate, “Pegih, kunt has wo juh ihda oꞌodham mam hab aꞌaga mo d em‑kownalig?”
<sax> “Crucify him!” they shouted back. ||| Kush si s‑kaidam hab kaij g hemajkam, “Muꞌani ab kots t ab!”
<sax> “Why? What crime has he committed?” Pilate asked them. ||| Kutsh hab chum chei g Pilate, “Haschu ahg? Shahchu at hig pi ap has juh?”
<sax> Wanting to please the mob, Pilate released Barabbas to them. First he had Jesus flogged and then handed him over to be crucified. ||| Kush g Pilate tatchua mat wo s‑hohhoꞌi g hemajkam ch atsh heg hekaj am i dagito g Barabbas am ha wui k am ha cheha g shondal mat am wo gewitta g Jesus. Kumtsh wa woho hab juh. Tsh am hahawa ha wui dagito matsh gam hu wo be k ab wo naggia kots t ab.
<sax> Then they saluted him, saying, “Hail King of the Jews!” ||| Kush hab wabsh s‑ahgamk ch hab kaij, “Tash g d ha‑kownaligk g Tutuligo hemajkam.”
<sax> They repeatedly beat him around the head with a rod, spat at him, and fell on their knees before him as if in worship. ||| Tsh haꞌi an si gewitta moꞌoj an g uhskaj k ab siswuimad k ab wui i shul pehegia ab has elidch.
<sax> After they finished mocking him, they took off the purple robes, and put his own clothes back on him. Then they led him away to be crucified. ||| Kumtsh am i haꞌasa nahnkogid k am si wuahawua hegai kownal eniga k ab uhpam wahki g enigaj k gam hu hahawa i bei mat ab wo naggia kots t ab.
<sax> They forced a passer-by, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming from the countryside, to carry his cross. Simon was the father of Alexander and Rufus. ||| D ab hema i ha nam g oꞌodham ch ab him Jerusalem wui ch ash hab chehgig Simon. Id ad an bei g shondal k ab kushwiotach hegai kots mamt ab ab wo naggia g Jesus. Ihda Simon ash ab d kihkam Cyrene kihhim t ab ch d ha‑ohg idam Alexander ch Rufus.
<sax> They brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha, which means “the Place of the Skull.” ||| Kumd gam hu i bei g Jesus mam am ha nahngia. K hab e aꞌaga amai Golgotha mo id hab d ahga Koshwak.
<sax> They offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he refused it. ||| Kumd am chum iꞌich g nawait ch kulani mat wo hehogih g s‑koꞌok. Kud pi shaꞌi ih g Jesus.
<sax> Then they crucified him. They divided his clothes, and threw dice to decide who would have what. ||| Kumd ab hahawa sisish kots t ab k am kei g kots. D am haꞌi e chichwi g shondal k wo nei mas hedai haschu wo bei g haꞌichu enigaj.
<sax> It was nine in the morning when they crucified him. ||| K eda ga hu i juhk madki heki hu e ai g humukt ohla mamd ab naggia kots t ab.

<sax> People passing by shouted insults at him, shaking their heads, and saying. “Aha! You who claimed you were going to destroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days; ||| D hegam mo am bihbimhim nahnko ahg ch hab ahg, “Naptsh woho wo i wua g geꞌe cheopi k am uhpam ep wo i kei waik tash ab?
<sax> save yourself and come down from the cross!” ||| Pegih, ab g hig i huduni kots t amjed k wo e doꞌibia maptp wo e nako.”
<sax> Likewise the chief priests and the religious teachers made fun of him, saying to each other, “He saved others, but he can't save himself. ||| D g uꞌugchu papal ch chehanig t‑mashchamdam am hab waꞌap nahnko ahg hab kaijch ab aꞌai e wui, “Id atsh haꞌi ha doꞌibia k atki wabshaba pi wo e nako mas wo hejel e doꞌibia.
<sax> If he really is the Messiah, the King of Israel, then why doesn't he come down from the cross so we can see and believe!” Even those who were crucified with him insulted him. ||| Nash hig pi woho d Jiosh si Kehsha ch d t‑kownalig?

<sax> At noon darkness fell over the whole land until three in the afternoon. ||| D am i dahm juh. D wehsko gei g s‑chuhugam waik ohla ab.
<sax> At three o'clock Jesus cried out, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani,” which means, “My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?” ||| D am i e ai g waik ohla. D si s‑kaidam hab kaij g Jesus, “Eloi, Eloi, lama sabaktani.” Id o hab d ahga, “Ni‑Jioshga, ni‑Jioshga, pt haschu ahgk wabsh ni‑dagito?”
<sax> Some of those standing there heard this, and said, “He's calling for Elijah.” ||| D haꞌijj hab kaij hegam mad am gegok, “Nehꞌe, Elijabad o ab chum waid.”
<sax> The Temple veil was ripped in two from top to bottom. ||| Kutsh hegai s‑kowk ikus kuhpadag mash am s‑tadnim naggia ged hu si eda g geꞌe cheopi ab si shel e wantsh.
<sax> When the centurion standing there in front of Jesus saw how he died, he said, “This man was truly the Son of God.” ||| D hegai moki d shondal ha‑geꞌejig gahab kehk kots wui ch am kah g Jesus ch am neid mat has masma muh ch hab kaij, “Ihda oki si s‑wohom d alidaj g Jiosh.”
<sax> Some women were watching from a distance including Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the younger and Joses, and Salome. ||| D ga hu sha mehkjed g uꞌuwi ab haꞌi neid mat haschu has e juh. Haꞌi idam o d Salome ch Mary Magdalene ch hegai Mary mo d ha‑jeꞌe idam James ch Joses.
<sax> They had followed Jesus and had taken care of him while he was in Galilee. Many other women who had come with him to Jerusalem were also there. ||| Idam waik ash am wehmaj oiopohim g Jesus ch haꞌichukaj i wehmt mo eda gam hu oimmelhim Galilee chekshani ch ed. Kud muꞌi idam uꞌuwi am wehmaj ab i hihi g Jesus Jerusalem wui.
<sax> It was Friday, the day before the Sabbath. When evening came,  Joseph of Arimathea, a member of the governing council who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, had the courage to go to Pilate and ask for Jesus' body. ||| D am haꞌichug hegai e jehnigiddam mo ab Arimathea t amjed ch hab chehgig Joseph.

<sax> Pilate was surprised that Jesus had died so soon, so he summoned the centurion and asked him if Jesus had already died. ||| Kush g Pilate hab kaij, “A nat wa s‑wohom heki hu i muh?” atsh am hahawa wai g shondal ha‑geꞌejig.
<sax> Once he had confirmation from the centurion, Pilate gave permission for Joseph to take the body. ||| Sh id hab kaij mat heki hu muh.
<sax> Joseph bought a linen sheet. Then he took Jesus' body down from the cross and wrapped it in the sheet, and placed it in a tomb that had been cut out of rock. Then he rolled a heavy stone up against the entrance. ||| Kutsh g Joseph am him k am ha nolawt g si s‑kehg ikus k am ep jiwia. Kumd am wehhejed ab i huduni g Jesus honshpadag.

<sax> Very early Sunday morning, just at sunrise, they went to the tomb.  They were asking each other, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?” ||| Wabsh i siꞌalim mo e aihim g domig, tsh gam hu hihi idam hihaꞌini wui k am neneokhim ch hab kaij, “Kus hedai t‑wehhejed gam hu wo i nuꞌichkwua hegai hodai mat ab hekaj e kuh g cheo?” Tsh ab i chesh g tash matsh eda ged hu dada.
<sax> But when they arrived and looked, they saw that the very large, heavy stone had already been rolled away. ||| Tsh chum nei matsh heki hu in hu hab i e nuꞌichkwua.
<sax> When they went into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right, wearing a long white robe. They became very frightened. ||| Tsh am i wahp. Kush inhab hema dak ch hab sha mahs mo g wechij oꞌodham. Sh g enigaj wabsh si s‑toa. Kutsh si e totods g uꞌuwi.
<sax> “Don't be frightened,” he told them. “You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, the one who was crucified. He is risen from the dead. He is not here. ||| Sh wabshaba hab ha ahg, “Pi g am wo shaꞌi e totodsid. M ani wa s‑mahch mam g Jesus chuhkug chum gahghim. Am g wo neid mo pi ia hu haꞌichug iia mat ia e woi.

<sax> Look, this is the place where they laid him to rest. Now go, and tell his disciples and Peter that he's going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there just as he told you.” ||| Kumt gam hu wo hihim k wo ha ahgi g chuhchaij, chum wa g Peter, mat uhpam e chegito k gam hu wo hih Galilee wui.

<sax> They left and ran from the tomb, shaking and confused. They said nothing to anyone because they were too scared. ||| Kutsh i wuwhag k gam hu uhpam wohp pi hedai shaꞌi ha ahgidch wohg oidch nash pi si e totodsid.
<sax> When Jesus rose from the dead on Sunday morning, he appeared first of all to Mary Magdalene, from whom he'd driven out seven demons. ||| Pi atsh wa koi mahsi domig tash matsh eda e chegito g Jesus.

<sax> They returned and told the others, but they didn't believe them either. ||| Kutsh idam am uhpam ep hihim k ged hu wehs ha ahgi g chuhchaij. Kush pi shaꞌi ha wohochud.
<sax> After this he appeared to the eleven disciples as they were eating. He rebuked them for their lack of trust and their stubbornness, because they had not believed those who'd seen him after he had risen. ||| Tsh am hahawa i e chehgi g Jesus hegam ha wui gamai hemako e‑chuhchai. Sh idam am e wehm e gegosid. Tsh am s‑ha kehꞌel nash ge ha wohochud hegam mash neid mo d doakam
<sax> Then he told them, “Go to the whole world, and announce the good news to everyone. ||| ch hab hahawa ha ahg, “Am g wo aꞌai hihim k am wo i ha ahgidahi wehs hemajkam ihda s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh ab ni‑amjed.
<sax> Anyone who trusts in me and is baptized will be saved, but anyone who chooses not to trust will be condemned. ||| Kut heg wo e doꞌibia matp hedai wo i s‑wohochud k wo e pahl wako. T wabshaba ab wo moht g pi ap e‑chuꞌijig k ab wo ai g pi ha huhugedam shoꞌigdag matp hedai pi ab hu wo wohoch.
<sax> The following signs will accompany those who trust in me: in my name they will drive out demons; they will speak new languages; ||| T wo tashok mo hedai ab ni‑hiwig nant pi ab wo ha mah g gewkdag. Kut am wo i ha wuwhasidad g jijawul ni‑wehhejed ch ep wo neneokad g gawul kaidam neꞌokikaj mat pi hebai mai.
<sax> they will be able to handle snakes; if they drink something poisonous they won't be harmed; they will place their hands on the sick and they will be healed.” ||| Kut pi has wo e juh matp wo ha taht g kohkꞌoi o atp wo ihꞌed g hialwui. Kut an wo ha taht g kokꞌodam. T wo doda.”
<sax> Then, the Lord Jesus, when he had finished speaking to them, was taken up into heaven where he sat down at the right hand of God. ||| Kutsh am i haꞌas ha wehm neo g Jesus k am i dahm hahawa uhgk i e bei dahm kahchim wui k ga hu s‑apkojed dahiwua e‑ohg Jiosh hugid ab.
<sax> The disciples went out and spread the good news everywhere, and the Lord worked with them, confirming the message through miraculous signs that accompanied it. ||| T idam gam hu aꞌai ha ahgidahi g hemajkam g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh. Kut g Jiosh si s‑hasig haꞌichu hab ha juni mat hekaj wo s‑mahchk g hemajkam mo d wohokam g haꞌichu ha‑ahga.
<sax> I always thank my God for you, remembering you in my prayers,  because I hear of your trust in the Lord Jesus and your love for all believers.  I pray that you will put the generous nature of your trust in God into action as you recognize all the good things we share in Christ.  Your love, my dear brother, has brought me much happiness and encouragement. You have revived the hearts of those of us who believe! ||| Ab apsh wabsh kia si hiwig g t-kownalig Jesus ch si pihk e elid ha hekaj g e-wehm wohochuddam.

<sax> That's why even though I'm brave enough in Christ to order you to do your duty, ||| Ab o ni-mahkch g Christ g gewkdag mant ab wo haꞌichu em-cheha ahpim mam ab ihm.
<sax> I would rather ask you this favor out of love. Old Paul, now also a prisoner of Christ Jesus, ||| Nt wabshaba ab wabsh wo i m-gewkemhu mapt haꞌichu hab wo ni-juni heg wabsh hekaj map si pihk e elid t-hekaj. Dani keli hemu ch ia kuhpi Jesus Christ wehhejed. Kupt ab wo si pihk e el ni-wui k hekaj hab wo juh g ni-tatchui.
<sax> is appealing to you on behalf of Onesimus who became my adopted son during my imprisonment. ||| Ia o ni-wehmaj ihda m-neholiga mo hab chehgig Onesimus. Ni am ahgid ab amjed g t-kownalig Jesus. T ab i s-wohoch. K heg wa wepo mo d ni-alidag am t-wohochudadag ed.
<sax> In the past he was of no use to you, but now he's useful to both you and me! ||| Heki ash hu s-padmam chikpan m-wehhejed ch wabshaba hemu s-wagimam chikpan mo hab masma hab d ahga g chehgigaj ch hab haꞌichu ni-junid am m-wehhejed.
<sax> I send him to you with my fondest wishes. ||| Ab ani chehani mat am uhpam ep wo hih m-wui. Kupt hab masma ab wo neidad mo d ni-alidag.
<sax> I'd have preferred to keep him here with me so that he could have helped me as you would have done while I am in chains for telling the good news.  But I decided not do anything without your permission. I didn't want you to be forced to do good, but to do so willingly. ||| Chum ani hi wa tatchua mat ia wo i ni-wehmt m-wehhejed mani ia kuhpi ch ahg g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh. K wabshaba pi hab chum chuꞌig manis wo m-wohppoꞌi g m-pionag. Baꞌich o i s-apꞌe mat hejel hab wo i e ah mapt has masma wo i ni-wehmt.
<sax> Maybe you lost him for a while so that you could have him back forever! ||| Do heb hu himkam ihda m-pionag al heꞌes i tash. Kuki wabshaba hab d elidaj g Jiosh mat hab masma wo e chehg k d haha wo m-wehm wohochuddamk chum hekid.
<sax> If he has done you any wrong, or owes you anything, charge it to my account. ||| Ab atsh m-wui pi ap chuꞌi. Kupt wabshaba ahni ab wo ni-mohtoꞌi.
<sax> I Paul am signing this with my own hand: I will repay you. Of course I won't mention what you owe me, including your very self! ||| Ahni ant wo m-namkid heg hekaj, chum aps ahpi ab ni-ab e wulshch nant pi am m-wui uꞌapa g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga mapt hekaj e doꞌibia.
<sax> Yes, brother, I'm expecting this favor from you in the Lord; please make me happy in Christ. ||| Pegih, pt hab masma hab wo elidad g Onesimus mat d wo m-wehnagk. Id at ab wo si i ni-gewkemhu am wehhejed g Jiosh alidag.
<sax> I'm writing about this to you because I'm convinced you'll do as I ask—in fact I know you'll do even more than I've asked! ||| Id ant am i m-oꞌohani s-mahchch mapt baꞌich i dahm haꞌichu hab wo ni-juni mani m-tahni.
<sax> In the meantime please have a room ready for me, for I hope to be able to return to see you soon in answer to your prayers. ||| Jiosh at ab wo kaiha g em-hoꞌigeꞌidahuna k ab wo i ni-wuhshad ab amjed g kukpaikud. Nt am ep wo i em-chehgim. Kumt heg hekaj am wo i apꞌech g kih ni-wehhejed.
<sax> Epaphras who is here in prison with me sends his greetings, ||| Ia o ep ni-wehm kuhpi g Epaphras ch s-m-hoꞌigeꞌid.
<sax> as do my co-workers Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke. ||| K ia ep dadha g Mark ch Aristarcas ch Demas ch Luke ch hab waꞌap s-m-hoꞌigeꞌid.
<sax> May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with all of you. ||| T-kownalig Jesus Christ at wo wa s-em-hoꞌigeꞌel.
<sax> because you've been partners with me in spreading the good news right from the beginning up till now. ||| Am am chikpanid g Jiosh ch haꞌichukaj am i ni-wehmaj gd hu i amjed mani wa am em-ahgid g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh.
<sax> I'm absolutely sure that God who began this good work in you will continue working and bring it to a successful conclusion when Jesus Christ returns. ||| Kuni heg hekaj s-mahch mat am wo himchudahid g Jiosh ihda doꞌibiadag em-wehhejed. Am at i shonwuich em-doakag ed k wo nahto mat hekid ia ep wo jiwia g Jesus Christ jewed dahm.
<sax> It's appropriate for me to be thinking this way about all of you because you mean so much to me. Whether I'm in prison or out there making the good news clear, all of you share God's grace together with me. ||| Bani wa masma hab em-elid nani pi chum hekid am i em-chegitod. Kum ahpim hab waꞌap chum hekid s-ni-chegito ch haꞌichukaj i ni-wehmt, chum hems hemu mani ia hu d lihso.
<sax> God is my witness as to my great affection for every one of you in the caring love of Christ Jesus. ||| Ab o ni-mahkch g Jesus Christ g si geꞌe pihk elidadag em-hekaj. K g Jiosh s-mahch mo id d wohokam mani em-ahgid.
<sax> My prayer is that your love may grow more and more in knowledge and understanding, ||| Kuni ab tahni mat hab wo em-juh mat baꞌich wo i geꞌeda g pihk em-elidadag ch haꞌichu em-mahchig ch haꞌichu em-amichudadag.
<sax> so that you can work out what's really important. That way you can be genuine and blameless when Christ returns, ||| Mt heg amjed wo s-mahchk hegai mo s-apꞌe mamt hab wo junihid ch pi am hu wo edak g pi apꞌekam ch pi wo ha chuꞌijigk mat hekid ep wo jiwia g Jesus Christ.
<sax> filled with the fruits of living right that come through Jesus Christ and give glory and praise to God. ||| Heg o hab em-wua mamt am wo e chehgidch mam am hab wua g s-apꞌekam haꞌichu ch heg hekaj ab haꞌichuchud g Jiosh ch ab hehgchulid.
<sax> I want you to know, my brothers and sisters, that all I've experienced has worked out to move the good news forward! ||| S-em-ahgidamk ani mo baꞌich i e gantan ihda s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh heg hekaj mani ia kuhpi.
<sax> Yes, some speak out of jealousy and rivalry. However there are those who speak from good motives.  They act out of love, because they know that I'm meant to be here to defend the good news.  Those others present Christ deceptively because of their selfish ambitions, trying to cause me problems in my imprisonment. ||| Haꞌi o am hi chikpan ab si hejel e-tatchui amjed mat baꞌich wo i chum wahmud g haꞌichu pi ni-apꞌedag hemuch mani wa hu d lihso no pi s-ni-hehgamk ch wabsh ni-pipꞌichud. K wabshaba haꞌi ni-hekaj si pihk e elid ch ahgachug g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga no pi s-mahch mat g Jiosh am i ni-kei mant wo wohokamch g haꞌichu ahgaj.
<sax> But so what? All I care about is that Christ is presented every which way, whether just pretending or whether from true convictions. That's what makes me happy—and I will go on being happy! ||| K pi has chuꞌig. Ni wabsh s-ap ni-tahtk mo e ahgachug g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga, chum as haꞌi pi ap haꞌichu e-tatchui ab am wo ahgahi.
<sax> Why? Because I'm convinced that through your prayers for me, and through the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, this will turn out to be my salvation. ||| E am hoꞌigeꞌidahun am ni-wehhejed. K g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag i ni-wehmaj. Ni heg hekaj si s-ap ni-tahtk ch s-mahch mamt wo i ni-wuhshad.
<sax> For it's my strongest hope and expectation not to do anything of which I would be ashamed. Instead it's my bold hope, as always, that even now Christ will be greatly honored through me, whether I live or die. ||| Tatchua ani mant chum hekid wehs hab wo juh mo haschu i ni-tatchuid g Christ pi haꞌichu ehbidch, wahm hemuch. Bant masma ab wo si has elidad wehs ni-ihbdagkaj, chum anis hems wo ni-muhkid heg hekaj.
<sax> As far as I'm concerned, living is for Christ, and dying brings gain. ||| Neh, pi o has d ahga g ni-doakag ni-wehhejed. Chum ani hi wa s-wehmjimk g Christ. K heg hekaj chum s-apꞌe mant hu wo i muh.
<sax> But if I'm to go on living here and this would be productive work, then I really don't know what's best to choose!  For I'm in a dilemma—I really want to leave and be with Christ, which would be far better, ||| Ntp wabshaba d wo doakamk ch baꞌich wo i chikpandad g Christ. Ni-wehhejed o hi wa baꞌich i s-apꞌe mant wo muhk k wo wehmajk g Christ.
<sax> and yet to remain physically here is more important as far you're concerned. ||| K wabshaba em-wehhejed hi baꞌich i s-apꞌe mant d wo doakamk.
<sax> Since I'm absolutely sure of this, I know that I'll stay here, remaining with you all to help you as your trust and delight in God grows, ||| Ni heg hekaj s-mahch mant d wo doakamk ch hab am wo i em-wehmajk. Mt wo i geꞌehogat am e-wohochudadag ed ch hab wo si s-ap e tahtkkad.
<sax> Don't let your enemies scare you. By being brave you will demonstrate to them that they will be lost, but that God himself will save you. ||| Pi g wo shaꞌi ha ehbidad hegam mo ab em-wui gegok. T heg amjed wo s-mahchk mat ab wo bei g s-koꞌok e-namkidadag. Mt ahpim ab wo bei g e-doꞌibiadag ab amjed g Jiosh.
<sax> For you have been given the privilege not only of trusting in Jesus, but suffering for him as well. ||| Do Jiosh hab elida mamt pi ab wabsh wo s-wohochudad g Christ ch wabshaba am wehhejed ep wo e shoꞌigchudad.
<sax> You're experiencing the same struggle you saw me having—a struggle I still have, as you now know. ||| Ab amt wui wo gegokkad g pi apꞌekam hab masma mam am wa neid mani hab ni-wua ch hemu kah mani hab wabsh kia ni-wua.
<sax> So then, if you're encouraged by being in Christ, if you're comforted by his love, if you share together in the Spirit, if you have compassion and sympathy— ||| Bani em-elid mam s-ap ab e dagitokch Jesus Christ wui. K heg ab si i em-gewkemhun. Kum si s-ap e tahtk no pi si em-tatchua. Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag o am em-wehmaj. Kum aꞌai e hekaj si pihk e elid.
<sax> then make my joy complete by thinking the same way and loving the same way, spiritually united and having one purpose. ||| Nt heg hekaj ab wo si i em-gewkemhu mamt wo i hemakoj g e-chegitoidag k ab baꞌich wo i e tatchuad ch baꞌich wo i s-ap e tahtkkad ab aꞌai e wui. Nt heg amjed wo si s-ap ni-taht.
<sax> Don't do anything from a spirit of selfishness or pride, but humbly think of others better than you do of yourself. ||| Pi amt wo s-chu daꞌad ch pi wo chum ge e haꞌichuchudad. Ab amt wabsh wo i e shoꞌigchudch ab aꞌai e wui ch pi waꞌi si hejel am wo e chegitod.
<sax> None of you should be preoccupied about your own things—instead concern yourself with the interests of others too. ||| Am g wo waꞌi chegitod g ha-apꞌedag haꞌi ehp, pi heg waꞌi hejel e-apꞌedag.
<sax> The attitude you should have is the same as that of Christ Jesus. ||| Bamt masma haꞌichu wo chum chegitok mash wa g Jesus Christ ch pi hejel wo chum si e haꞌichuch.
<sax> Do everything without complaining or arguing ||| Kumt heg am hab wo junihid pi has ahgch mamt hekid heg hekaj wo e shoꞌigch.
<sax> so that you'll be sincere, innocent of any wrong. Be God's blameless children living in the middle of a dishonest and corrupt people. Shine among them as lights to the world, ||| T hab pi wo em-chuꞌijigch g Jiosh. Dam Jiosh aꞌaliga ch d wo chum si hekia s-apꞌekamk am ha shahgid hegam mo pi mahch g Jiosh. Idam o s-chu iꞌattomk ch totontodag. Kumt hab wo sha masmak am ha wehhejed mo g huhuꞌu am ha wehhejed g s-chuhugam k ed oiopodam
<sax> holding out to them the word of life. That way I'll have something to be proud of when Christ returns, proving I didn't run around and work for nothing! ||| am ha ahgidch mo g Jiosh ab ha makiog g wechij doakag. T g Jesus Christ ab wo si em-haꞌichuch mat hekid ia ep wo jiwia jewed dahm. Nt heg hekaj wo si s-hehgigk mat g ni-chikpan pi wabsh wo e nahnkogi.
<sax> So even if I pour out my life as a sacrifice and offering so you may trust in God, I'm happy for it, and I'm glad together with all of you, ||| Ab amt i s-wohoch g haꞌichu ni-ahga k am i e dagito Jiosh wui hab sha masma mo wa ab wui haꞌichu e iagchulid. Kunt hemho wa wo si s-ap ni-taht mamt am wui i e dagito, chum anis hems wo ni-muhkid nani pi ahgachug g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. Id at heg wo wa wepok mat g ni-ehꞌed wo e iawua em-wehhejed hab sha masma mo wa g nawait e iawua ab ab g iagchulida.
<sax> just as you have such joy and are glad with me. ||| Pegih, ahpim g ep wo si s-ap e tahtk ni-wehm matp g Jiosh hab wa masma wo haꞌichuch g ni-chikpan.
<sax> I'm hoping, if that's what the Lord Jesus wants, to send Timothy to you soon. It will cheer me up once I know how you're doing. ||| Hemu ant wo cheha g Timothy mat am wo i em-chehgim matp d wo t-kownalig Jesus tatchuik. T heg ia wo uꞌapa g haꞌichu ahga ab em-amjed mat am wo i ni-gewkemhu.
<sax> I don't know anyone who genuinely cares about you as he does. ||| Timothy o d waꞌi hegai mo hab wa masma hab e tahtk ab em-amjed mani ahni ch si s-ap wo em-nuhkud.
<sax> Other people only worry about their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. ||| Haꞌi o hi g hejel e-tatchui am hab elid ch wabsh pi ab hu haꞌichuchud g hab elidaj g Jesus Christ.
<sax> and I trust in the Lord that shortly I'll be able to come too. ||| Bani elid mo d tatchuij g t-kownalig Jesus mant ahni am hab waꞌap wo i him k wo em-nei.
<sax> But I thought it was important to send Epaphroditus to you. He's a brother to me, a co-worker and fellow-soldier. He's the one you sent to look after me, ||| Ia ant wo cheha g em-kehsha Epaphroditus mat am uhpam ep wo hih em-wui. Ia o i ni-wehmaj hab masma mamsh am ahgid ch muꞌi haꞌichu ni-wehm nakog.
<sax> and he's been longing to see all of you, worried about you because you'd heard he was sick. ||| Msh wabshaba kah mat wa mumku. K si s-em-neidamk ch e kudut mamsh id kah.
<sax> He certainly was sick—he nearly died—but God had mercy on him. Not just on him, but on me too, so that I wouldn't have tragedy upon tragedy. ||| Woho o wa mat si mumku k chum alo muh. T wabshaba g Jiosh ab si i s-hoꞌigeꞌid k doaj. K hab waꞌap d ni-hoꞌigeꞌidadag mat pi muh nant pi wo si pi ap ni-taht mat hems wo sha muh.
<sax> That's why I'm so keen to send him, so that when you see him you'll be happy, and I won't have to be so anxious. ||| Ni heg hekaj chehani mat am uhpam wo hih. Mt hab wo si s-hehgigk am neidok. Nt ahni hab waꞌap wo si s-hehgigk ch pi wo ni-kudu em-hekaj.
<sax> So welcome him with much happiness in the Lord—honor people like him,  because in working for Christ he nearly died, putting his life on the line to make up for the help you weren't in a position to give me. ||| Kumt ab wo si has el nat pi pi huwi g e-doakag mat hab wo juh g Christ tatchui k wo i ni-wehmt em-wehhejed.
<sax> To sum up: my dear friends, delight in the Lord! It's not a burden for me to repeat these things to you—it's to keep you safe! ||| Mt wabsh wo si s-hehgigk mo d em-kownalig g Jesus Christ. Pi ani has shaꞌi ni-tahtk mant am ep em-oꞌohani hegai mant wa heki hu em-oꞌohani. Kut id d wo i em-wehmtadagk.
<sax> Watch out for the wolves, those who do evil, those who insist on physical circumcision— ||| Haꞌi o hab junihim g pi apꞌekam ch eda chum ahgahim mamt hab wo junihid g chehanig ch hab wo i e apꞌech am Jiosh tahgio. Mt wo si s-e nenꞌoidk ab ha amjed. Bo masma pi haꞌichu amichud mo g gogogs.
<sax> I was circumcised on the eighth day, I'm an Israelite of the tribe of Benjamin, a true Hebrew. Regarding legal observance I'm a Pharisee; ||| nani pi d Tuhligo ch ni-pahl hikuch mani eda d gigiꞌik tash hab masma mo an oꞌohanas chehanig ch ed. Benjaminbad o d ni-shohshon ch d hema hegam gamai gohk t-shohshon ahchim Tutuligo. Dani wa Palasi mo hegam hab e elid mo pi ha chuꞌijig ab amjed g t-chehanig.
<sax> as for religious dedication I was a persecutor of the church; while in regard to doing right according to the law I was blameless! ||| Ha anid shoꞌigchud hegam mo ab ihm g Jesus Christ nani pi hab ha elid mo ab wui gegok g t-chehanig. Neh, banid wa masma hab ni-wua ch hekaj hab ni-elid mani pi ha chuꞌijig.
<sax> But in whatever way such things gained me anything, I count them as a loss for Christ. ||| T wabshaba am hahawa i e tashogi g Jesus Christ ni-wui. Kuni hemuch hahawa pi ab hu haꞌichuchud wehs ihda nani pi g Jesus Christ ab si haꞌichuchud.
<sax> Truly, I count everything as loss in exchange for the incredible benefit I've gained through knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. I've thrown away all these things for him, and consider them trash, so that I might gain Christ. ||| Wehs haꞌichu o d wabsh pi haꞌichu hahawa no pi baꞌich i s-apꞌe mant wo s-mahchk g t-kownalig Jesus Christ. Wehs ant haꞌichu s-ohhod mant wo s-mai g Jesus Christ
<sax> I want to be found in him, not being right because of what I've done, or what the law requires, but made right through confidence in Christ, set right by God through trusting in him. ||| k am wo i ni-hemakoj heg wehm. Heki anid hu g chehanig oidch hab ni-elid mani s-apꞌe am Jiosh tahgio. T wabshaba am hahawa i ni-tashogi g wohokam g Jesus Christ. Kunt ab i s-wohoch. T hekaj am i ni-apꞌech g Jiosh e tahgio.
<sax> I want to really know him, and the power of his resurrection—to take part in his suffering and become like him in his death, ||| Ni hahawa tatchua mant wo si s-mahchk g Jesus Christ ch ab wo taht hegai gewkdaj mat hekaj i wuhsh ab muhkig amjed, chum anis hems hab waꞌap wo ni-shoꞌigch.
<sax> so that somehow I might be part of the resurrection from the dead! ||| Neh, bant wa masma hab waꞌap wo i wuhsh ab muhkig amjed mat d wo si oidchkam tashk.
<sax> Not that I've already got it all, or that I'm already perfect—but I run so that I might win what was won for me by Christ Jesus. ||| Pi ani hab kaij manis heki hu wehs ab i neid ihda ch wehs apꞌechudas ch wabshaba am ni-nakog mant heg ab wo bei mo haschu ab ni-makiog g Jesus Christ ch hekaj an ni-bei.
<sax> Those of us who are spiritually mature should think like this, and if you think anything different, then God will reveal this to you. ||| Wehsijj att hab wo wa chum t-junihid ahchim mach s-gegokim hihim g t-wohochudadag. Haꞌijj amtp hems pi hab masma hab e junihim. T wabshaba g Jiosh wo mahsko em-wuij mam haschu i pi ap hab wua.
<sax> We just need to make sure that we follow what we already have understood. ||| Am amt wo oidad g wohokam mam ab heꞌes i heki hu s-mahch ch am hab junihim.
<sax> My friends, copy my example as others do and take note of the way to behave since you have us as a model. ||| Am ani si s-gewkam oid g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch am em-chehgid mamt has wo masmak. Mt wo si ha nenashanad hegam mo am hab e wua mani has i masma em-chehgid ch am ha oidk hab wo e junihid.
<sax> The way some people live makes them enemies of the cross of Christ—as I've often told you before and repeat again though it pains me so much I want to weep. ||| Ab at e muhkid g Jesus Christ kots t ab mat wo t-doꞌibia. K eda muꞌijj ab wui gegok ihda s-kehg haꞌichu ahga. Id o si pi ap ni-tahtchud. Kuni wa muꞌikko am em-ahgid ihda heki hu ch hemu am ep em-ahgid.
<sax> They will end up being completely lost, these people whose “god” is their physical desires and who are proud of what they should be ashamed of, thinking only about the things of this world. ||| Idam o heg waꞌi ab si has elid hejel e-tatchui ch heg waꞌi s-hohhoꞌid jewed t ab haꞌichu. T g Jiosh gam hu wo i ha shul Jiawul kih ed no pi e hahaschud heg hekaj mat hekaj wo chum si e ehꞌelidad.
<sax> But our homeland is heaven, and we're waiting for a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, to come from there too. ||| Kuch wabshaba ahchim am chegito g dahm kahchim ch ed t-kihdag. Ab at amjed wo jiwia g t-doꞌibiakam Jesus Christ. Kuch ab nenida.
<sax> He will re-create our defective human bodies so that they will be made like his glorious body using the power by which he brings everything under his control. ||| Heg at gawul wo juh g mukialig t-hon heg hekaj si geꞌe e-gewkdag mat hekaj wehs haꞌichu wo dahmkad.

<sax> So stand firm in the Lord, my dear friends who mean so much to me, who make me so happy! To me you are my crowning achievement! I truly love you and long to see you! ||| Pegih, ab amt i s-wohoch g haꞌichu ni-ahga ab amjed g t-kownalig Jesus. M d hahawa si ni-tatchuidch ni-wepnag.

<sax> Always be happy in the Lord—I repeat, Be happy! ||| Si g wo s-hehgig ab amjed g t-kownalig Jesus Christ mani hab masma chum hekid hab chechꞌe.
<sax> Everyone should know about your kindness. The Lord will soon be here. ||| E o aihim mat ep wo jiwia. Kumt heg hekaj wabsh wo i s-hehemajimak ab wehs ha wui g hemajkam.
<sax> Don't worry about anything, but take everything to God in prayer, explaining your requests to him and thanking him for all he does. ||| Pi g wo shaꞌi e kudut heg hekaj mam haschu i chum tatchua k ab wabsh wo i tai g Jiosh k ab wo i hoꞌigeꞌel matp haschu hab wo i t-juni.

<sax> Lastly, whatever is true, honorable, right, pure, beautiful, commendable, whatever is truly good and deserves to be praised, think about these kinds of things. ||| Am g wo chegitok wehs ihda mo haschu d s-apꞌekam k ab wo hehgchulidad g Jiosh heg amjed mo haschu d wohokam ch haschu d si oꞌodhamdag ch haschu d s-apꞌekam ch haschu s-kehgaj.
<sax> Put into practice what you learned and received from me, what you saw me doing and heard me say. Then the God of peace will be with you. ||| Am g wo i e mashcham k hab wo junihid hegai mam haschu i kahk ch ab bei ni-amjed. Kut wo e chehgi mo am em-wehmaj hegai mat t-doꞌibia k ab t-mahkch g s-ap tahhadkam.
<sax> I'm so happy in the Lord that you've at last thought about me again—realizing that you were concerned about me before but you couldn't do anything about it. ||| Si geꞌe s-hehgig ant bei ab amjed g Jiosh mamt ab ep i e chehgi mam ab si pihk e elid ni-wui. Tash o pi am hu em-apꞌe mams ab haꞌichu wo ni-mah k wo i ni-wehmt. Ni wabshaba s-mahch mam si pihk e elid ni-hekaj.

<sax> Even so it was good of you to share with me during my troubles. ||| K wabshaba si s-apꞌe mamt am i ni-wehmt pi ni-apꞌedag ed.
<sax> You Philippians remember that right at the beginning of sharing the good news, when I left Macedonia, that yours was the only church that helped me financially. ||| S-mahch am ahpim Philippi t am wohochuddam mam d waꞌi ahpim ch am i ni-wehmaj am i dahm mant am em-dagito am uꞌapak g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh amai Macedonia jewed ch ed.
<sax> Even when I was in Thessalonica you helped me out not once but twice. ||| Ni hebaichujj haꞌichu tatchua ab Thessalonica kihhim t ab. Kum ab ni-mamka.
<sax> Not that I'm looking for a donation—I'm looking for your “account” to increase in “profit.” ||| Pi o hab mahs manis heg ab waꞌi tatchua em-mahkig. Baꞌich ani i tatchua mamt ab wo bei g hoꞌigeꞌidalig ab amjed g Jiosh.
<sax> For I have everything, more than I need! I'm thankful to receive from Epaphroditus the things you sent. They're like a sweet-smelling sacrifice that pleases God and that he approves of. ||| Ia at uꞌapa g em-mahkig g Epaphroditus. Kuni hahawa pi haꞌichu shaꞌi tatchua.

<sax> This is the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants what will happen soon. He sent his angel to reveal it to his servant John ||| Hemu at am i tashogi g Jesus Christ hegai matsh haschu am hab wo e juh pi shaꞌi mehk iꞌajed. Jiosh ash am ahgid matsh am wo t-chehgi ahchim mach d piongaj. Tki heg am hema i kei g anghil. T id am ni-chehgi ahni John mani d piongaj g Jesus Christ.

<sax> Anyone who reads this is blessed, as are those who hear these prophetic words and pay attention to what's written, because the time is near. ||| Jiosh at wo wa s-ha hoꞌigeꞌel hegam mat am wo i neꞌokchul ch hegam mat ab wo kaihamad. E ash aihim mat am hab wo e juh wehs ihda gam hu baꞌich haꞌichu ahga mant in wo oꞌoha.
<sax> This letter comes from John and is sent to the seven churches in the province of Asia. May you have grace and peace from the One who was, who is, and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits before his throne,  and from Jesus Christ the trustworthy witness, the firstborn from the dead, the ruler of earthly kings. To Jesus who loves us and freed us from our sins by his blood, ||| Am ant wo i em-oꞌohani ahpim wewaꞌak dakam Jesus Christ ihmdam am Asia chekshani ch ed.
<sax> who made us into his kingdom, priests to his God and Father—to Jesus be glory and authority for ever and ever. Amen. ||| k hab t-juh mach d hahawa piongaj g t-ohg Jiosh ch am wo i ahgahid g haꞌichu ahgaj. Jesus Christ o wehs uꞌukch g gewkdag. Kutt ab wo ihmad chum hekid.
<sax> Look, he is coming surrounded by clouds, and everybody shall see him, even those who killed him. All the peoples of the earth will weep because of him. May it be so! Amen. ||| Neh, e o aihim mat ep wo jiwia ab dahm kahchim amjed. Wehs hemajkam at wo neidad, chum wa hegam mat ab sisish kots t ab. Wehs nahnko mahs hemajkam at wo shoshani heg hekaj.
<sax> “I am the Beginning and the End,” says the All-powerful Lord God, who was, who is, and who is to come. ||| T-kownalig Jiosh o wehs uꞌukch g gewkdag ch hab kaij, “Ahni ani d alpha ch d omega.” Idam o d si wehpeg ch si oidchkam oꞌohana. K hab ahg g Jiosh mo si wehpeg an haꞌichug ch si ha oidch an wabsh wo kia haꞌichugk.
<sax> I am John, your brother who shares with you in the suffering and in the kingdom and in the patient waiting that are our experience in Jesus. I was detained on the island of Patmos for sharing the word of God and the truth as revealed by Jesus. ||| Dani em-wehm wohochuddam ahni John nach pi ab t-hemakochudch g Jesus Christ wehm.

<sax> I turned round to see who was speaking to me. When I turned I saw seven golden candlesticks, ||| Neh, nt ab si sikol i kekiwua mant wo nei mas hedai ab ni-wui neok k haha wabsh nei mo g wewaꞌak ohla lalampa an dadha chuhchakud t an.
<sax> and standing among the candlesticks was someone who looked like a Son of man. He was wearing a robe that reached down to his feet with a golden sash across his chest. ||| K am ha shahgid hema kehk ch hab mahs mo g Jiosh si Kehsha. K g lihwaj ged hu si ais g tahtdaj. K g ohla giwud an hab juhkch e bahsho.
<sax> His hair looked like white wool, and his eyes like flaming fire. ||| K g moꞌoj si s-tohta hab masma mo g s-wihs gew. K g wuhpuij si s-masma tonod hab masma mo g s-toni nahda.
<sax> His feet looked like polished brass that had been refined in a furnace. His voice sounded like a thundering waterfall. ||| K g tahtdaj si s-wegima tonod hab masma mo g kohwli hahgig. K g neꞌokij hab masma hab kaidag mo g si geꞌe shuhdagi an med.
<sax> He was holding seven stars in his right hand, and a sharp double-edged sword came out of his mouth. His face shone like the sun at its brightest. ||| Id o an uꞌukch g wewaꞌak huhuꞌu s-apko e-nowi ed ch an kamshch g is-pahyo. K id ab i wuhshanis chinij ab. K g wuhioshaj shaꞌi si tonod hab masma mo g tash tonlig dahm juhk.
<sax> When I saw him I fell down at his feet as if I were dead. But he touched me with his right hand and said, “Don't be afraid, I am the first and the last, ||| Kunt am i neidok ab i gei wecho hab sha masma mo g muhki.
<sax> the Living One. I was dead, but look! Now I am alive for ever and ever, and I hold the keys of death and the grave. ||| Am ant wa chum ni-muhkid k uhpam ep ni-chegito k chum hekid d haha wo doakamk. Am ani dahm gewkdag g muhkig ch am dahm gewkdag amai mo am haꞌichug g koꞌi.
<sax> So write down what you've seen—what's happening in the present and what will happen in the future. ||| “Pegih, am g oꞌohan map haschu i neid mat hab wo e juh hemu ch haschu hab wo e juh imhab i dahm.
<sax> I know what you've accomplished, your hard work and perseverance. I know you can't tolerate evil people, and how you investigated those who claimed to be apostles but are not, and discovered they were frauds. ||| S-mahch ani mam haschu hab junihim. S-ap am chikpan ch am wabsh s-e bahbgi ch pi ab hu shaꞌi ha bahbgi hegam mo ab ni-wui gegok. Haꞌi o hab chum kaij mo d ni-chuhchai. Kumt eda ha aꞌappem k s-mai mo d wabsh s-chu iꞌattomkam.
<sax> I know about your patience, and what you endured for my sake—and that you didn't give up! ||| Ab amt s-bahbagi nako g shoꞌigdag ni-wehhejed k pi shaꞌi haꞌasa.
<sax> But I have something against you: you have neglected your first love. ||| “Neh, id o s-ta hohhoꞌidama. K wabshaba haꞌichu pi ta hohhoꞌidama ab em-ab. Pi am ab hu ni-tatchua hemuch hab masma mam wa ged hu i heki hu.
<sax> So remember how far you've fallen—repent and go back to what you were doing at first. Otherwise I'll come to you and I will remove your candlestick from where it is—unless you repent. ||| Am g wo i oidahim mamt heꞌesko i e mehkod ab ni-amjed k gam hu wo s-ohhod g pi ap e-chegitoi mamt hab ep wo masmak mam wa heki hu.

<sax> However you do have this to your credit: you hate the actions of the Nicolaitans,  just as I do. ||| Id am hi wa s-ap am hab junihim mam si pi hohhoꞌid mo haschu s-ta edam hab junihim hegam mo am oid g Nicolas. Id o wa chum pi apko ha wanimed g Jiosh hemajkamga. Ahni ani hab waꞌap si pi hohhoꞌid ihda.
<sax> If you have ears, listen to what the Spirit is telling the churches. I will give to those who are victorious the privilege of eating from the tree of life, which stands in the Paradise of God. ||| “Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag o am i maskogid g haꞌichu ni-ahga am em-wui ahpim mam ab si ni-hiwig ch am kihdag ha eꞌeda hegam wewaꞌak kihhim.

<sax> Write this to the angel of the Smyrna church: This is what the first and last says, the One who was dead and came back to life: ||| K hab ep kaij ab ni-wui, “Am g oꞌohanid g ha wanimeddam hegam mo ab si ni-hiwig ch am kihdag Smyrna t am. Id at am wo ha ahgi mani hab kaij:
<sax> I know the troubles you are going through, and how poor you are (but you are rich), and the abuse from those who say they are Jews but are not, but belong to Satan's synagogue. ||| S-mahch ani mam e kudut.

<sax> Write this to the angel of the Pergamum church: This is what the One holding the sharp two-edged sword says: ||| K hab ep kaij ab ni-wui, “Am g oꞌohanid g ha wanimeddam hegam mo ab si ni-hiwig ch am kihdag Pergamum t am. T id am wo ha ahgi mani hab kaij:
<sax> I know you're living where Satan has his throne, and that you have stayed true to me. You have not denied your trust in me, even when my faithful witness Antipas was killed right among you there where Satan lives! ||| S-mahch ani mo g Jiawul himdag si s-gewkdag amai.

<sax> But I have a few things against you: There are some among you who hold to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak how to entrap the children of Israel by means of eating food sacrificed to idols and committing sexual sins. ||| “K wabshaba am haꞌichu d hegai mani pi hohoꞌid am em-shahgid.

<sax> Similarly you also have some who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans. ||| Am o haꞌi ep em-wehmaj mo g Nicolas mashchama ab s-wohochud.
<sax> So repent, or soon I will come to you and fight against them using the sword of my mouth. ||| Gam g hu wo s-ohhod ihda pi apꞌekam. Nt wo em-cheggia heg hekaj is-pahyo mo ab i wuhshanis ni-chini amjed mamtp pi am hu wo i e apꞌech.
<sax> If you have ears, listen to what the Spirit is telling the churches. I will give the hidden manna to those who are victorious. I will give them a white stone with a new name written on it that nobody knows except those who receive it. ||| “Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag o am i maskogid g haꞌichu ni-ahga am em-wui ahpim mam ab si ni-hiwig ch am kihdag ha eꞌeda hegam wewaꞌak kihhim. Kumt wehsijj ab wo kaihamad.
<sax> Write this to the angel of the Thyatira church: This is what the Son of God says, the One who has eyes like flaming fire and feet like polished brass. ||| K hab ep kaij ab ni-wui, “Am g oꞌohanid g ha wanimeddam hegam mo ab si ni-hiwig ch am kihdag Thyatira t am.

T hegam chechoj mo am wehmaj wohppo am wehmaj ep wo e shoꞌigch. S-hohtam ant hab wo juh ihda heg hi wa matp gam hu wo s-ohhod g pi ap e-chegitoi.
<sax> I will put her children to death. Then all the churches will know that I am the one who examines thoughts and motives. I will repay each of you according to what you've done. ||| Nt wo ha kokda g mahmdaj mat wehs g ni-ihmdam wo s-mai mani s-mahch g hemajkam ha-chegitoidag ch ha-tatchuidag. Ab ant wo em-namkid heg hekaj mam haschu has i junihim.
<sax> For the rest of you there in Thyatira who don't follow this teaching, who have not learned Satan's ‘deep depravities’ as they are called, I don't place on you any other burden. I say to you, ||| “Haꞌijj ahpim Thyatira t am hemajkam amt pi am hu i oi ihda pi apꞌekam mashchamadag k pi mai hegai mo haꞌijj hab aꞌaga ‘Jiawul si s-juhk s-aꞌagi haꞌichu.’ Pi ant ab hu baꞌich haꞌichu s-wehch wo em-mohtoꞌi.
<sax> ‘Just hold on to what you have until I come.’ ||| Mt wabshaba hemho wa wo s-wihnam uꞌukchid hegai mam haschu i edgid ch ab wo ai mant wo uhpam jiwia.
<sax> I will give authority over the nations to those who are victorious and who do what I say until the end.  He will rule the nations with an iron rod, breaking them into pieces like clay pots.  In the same way that I received authority from my Father,  I will give them the morning star. ||| “Ni-ohg Jiosh at ab ni-mah g gewkdag mant wehs s-gewkam wo ha dahmkad g jejewed ch wo ha padch g pi apꞌekam kokownaltalig.

<sax> Write this to the angel of the Philadelphia church: This is what the One says, the One who is holy and true, who has the key of David. He can open and nobody is able to shut, he can shut, and nobody is able to open: ||| K hab ep kaij ab ni-wui, “Am g oꞌohanid g ha wanimeddam hegam mo ab si ni-hiwig ch am kihdag Philadelphia t am.

<sax> I saw a powerful angel shouting in a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?” ||| Neid ani ehp g si s-gewk anghil. K heg si s-kaidam amog ch hab kaij, “Dohꞌo am hugkam apꞌedag mat wo e nako mat wo wantsh g chechposig k ab wo i kuhpiꞌo ihda oꞌohana?”
<sax> One of the elders spoke to me and said, “Don't cry. Look, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Descendant of David, has won the battle and can open the scroll and its seven seals.” ||| K hab hahawa kaij hema hegam geꞌeged ab ni-wui, “Pi g am shoakad.

<sax> I saw a Lamb that looked as if it had been killed standing in the center by the throne and the four living creatures, among the elders. He had seven horns and seven eyes that are the seven Spirits of God that are sent out to all the earth. ||| Kuni hahawa neid hegai moki hab ahg.

<sax> When he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each of them had a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the believers. ||| T ha hekaj ab wui i shul hegam giꞌik haꞌichu doakam ch hegam gokko gamai giꞌik geꞌeged. K idam wehsijj ge ahlipa ch ohla hohas-hahaꞌa. K hegam ha eda hohas-hahaꞌa s-ap uhw shuhdagi ch id d ha-hoꞌigeꞌidahuna g Jiosh hemajkamga.
<sax> They sang a new song, “You are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals, for you were slain and with your blood you redeemed for God people from every tribe, language, people, and nation. ||| K am hema aꞌaga g wechij neꞌi. K g ha-neꞌi hab chuꞌig:
<sax> As I looked I heard the voices of millions of angels around the throne, together with the living creatures and the elders, ||| Nt am hahawa nea k ha kah muꞌi mihl anghil. Idam o an wehgaj gegok g geꞌe kownal daikud am ha wehm hegam giꞌik haꞌichu doakam ch hegam geꞌeged
<sax> shouting loudly together: “The Lamb that was slain is worthy to receive authority, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and blessing.” ||| ch si s-kaidam neꞌe hab masma:
<sax> I watched as the Lamb broke open the first of the seven seals. I heard one of the four living creatures shout with a thunderous voice, “Come! ||| Ni ab neid hegai mo kahwalkaj ab e chehgidch. Kutki hema gam wantsh hegam wewaꞌak chechposig. K hema hab kaij hegam giꞌik haꞌichu doakam, “Ab g i hihm.”
<sax> Another horse came out, a red one. Its rider was given a large sword, and the power to take away peace from the earth so that people would slaughter one other. ||| Tki ab hema ep i wuhsh g kawyu k ge s-wegi. K ab hema cheshaj. Kumt ab mah g gewkdag mat hab wo juh g cheggiadag an jewed dahm mat g hemajkam wo aꞌai e kokda. Kumt g geꞌe is-pahyo ab mah.
<sax> When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come!” I looked and saw a black horse. Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand. ||| Tki ab hahawa i kuhpiꞌo g waikkokam cheposig hegai mo kahwalkaj ab e chehgidch. Kuni kah g waikkokam haꞌichu doakam. K hab kaij, “Ab g i hihm.” Nt chum nei. T g s-chuk kawyu ab i wuhsh. K hema cheshaj ch g pisaltakud uꞌa.
<sax> I heard what seemed to be a voice coming from among the four living creatures that said, “Two pounds of wheat cost a day's wages, and three pounds of barley cost the same.  But don't damage the oil or the wine.” ||| K am hema neok ab ha shahgid hegam giꞌik haꞌichu doakam ch hab kaij, “T wo si s-namkigk g haꞌichu hugi.

<sax> When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living creature say, “Come!” ||| Tki gam hahawa wantsh k kuhpiꞌo g giꞌikkokam cheposig hegai mo kahwalkaj ab e chehgidch. Ni kah g giꞌikkokam haꞌichu doakam. K hab kaij, “I hihm.”
<sax> I looked and saw a pale horse. The rider was called Death, and Hades followed him. They received authority over a quarter of the earth to kill people by the sword, by famine, by plague, and by wild beasts. ||| Nt ab i chum nei. Tki g s-kohmagi kawyu ab i wuhsh.

<sax> When he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar those who had been killed because of their dedication to the word of God and their faithful witness. ||| Tki gam hahawa ep wantsh k kuhpiꞌo g hetaspokam cheposig hegai mo kahwalkaj ab e chehgidch. Kuni neid ab wecho g iagchulidakud g ha-dodakag hegam matki e koꞌij heg hekaj mo am ahgahim g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch pi shaꞌi dagito g haꞌichu e ahga.
<sax> They cried out, shouting, “How long, Lord who is holy and true, before you will judge and bring to justice those on earth who spilled our blood?” ||| Idam o si s-kaidam hihnk ch hab kaij, “Si s-gewkam kownal ch si s-apꞌekam ch si s-wohokam, heꞌes at wo i tashk mapt haha wo ha lodai g hemajkam an jewed dahm k ab wo ha mah g s-koꞌok namkidadag heg hekaj mat t-kokda?”
<sax> Each one of them was given a white robe, and they were told to wait for a little longer until their number was complete—their fellow-believers and brothers who would be killed like them. ||| Mt ab hahawa wehsijj i ha mahkhi g s-tohta liliwa k hab ha ahg mat wo shaꞌal baꞌich i e uhꞌulinihogid k ab wo ai mat wehs wo e koꞌij hegam ha wehm pion ch ha-wepnag mat ha wepo masma wo e koꞌij.
<sax> The sky disappeared like a scroll rolling up, and all the mountains and islands were moved from where they were. ||| Tki g dahm kahchim ab wabsh i huhug hab sha masma mat g tapial wo i e holiwkad k ged hu wo e cheh. Tki wehs g dohdaꞌag ch g al siꞌiskod jejewed am shuhdagi ch ed gam hu gawulko i e uhꞌul.
<sax> The kings of the earth, the great leaders, the wealthy, the powerful, and all people, slave or free, hid themselves in caves and among the rocks in the mountains. ||| Ni ha neid matki wehs chum e eꞌesto g hemajkam, chum hems g kokownal ch si s-has hahaꞌichu ch shondal ha-geꞌegeꞌejig ch s-gewpkkam ch hegam ehp mo d shoꞌigkam ch hegam mo d nenehol.

<sax> They called on the mountains and the rocks, telling them, “Fall upon us! Hide us from the face of the One who sits on the throne, and from the judgment of the Lamb. ||| ch ab si hihnk dohdaꞌag ch hohodai wui hab kaijch, “Ab g wo i shulig t-dahm mat pi wo t-neidad g Jiosh.

<sax> For the terrible day of their judgment has come, and who can stand against it?” ||| E o aihim g lodaita tash. Kutt pi wo shaꞌi t-nako matt ab wui wo gegokiwua.”
<sax> Then I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth holding back the earth's four winds to prevent any wind from blowing on the earth, or over the sea, or against any tree. ||| Ntki haha wabsh ha nei g giꞌik anghil.

Kuki gam hu wabsh i pi hoini wehs haꞌichu.
<sax> I watched another angel rise up from the east, holding the seal of the living God. He shouted in a loud voice to the four angels who had been given the power to damage the earth and the sea, ||| Kuni hahawa hema ep neid g anghil. Kuki id ab him siꞌal wecho amjed ch g Jiosh cheposidakud uꞌa. Kuki eda ab mahks hegam giꞌik mat wo padch g jewed ch kahchki. K wabshaba ihda hema ab ha wui hab kaij.
<sax> “Don't hurt the earth or the sea or the trees until we have placed a seal on the foreheads of God's true followers!” ||| “Pi g am s-koꞌokam has wo juhni g jewed ch kahchki ch kukui. Kutt ab hoꞌip kia ha chepos g Jiosh pionag ab ha-koka ab.”
<sax> I was told the number of those who were sealed: one hundred and forty-four thousand. Those who were sealed came from every tribe of the children of Israel: ||| Kuni kah mash d siant giꞌikko wehst-mahm gamai giꞌik mihl (144,000) hegam mamt ha chepos heg hekaj Jiosh cheposidakud.
<sax> twelve thousand from the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand from the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand from the tribe of Issachar, ||| Simeon, Levi, Issachar,
<sax> twelve thousand from the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand from the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand from the tribe of Benjamin. ||| Zebulun, Joseph, Benjamin.
<sax> After this I looked and saw a great crowd that nobody could count, made up of every nation, tribe, people and language. They were standing in front of the throne and the Lamb, dressed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands. ||| Ntki hahawa ep ha nei moki am shaꞌi si geꞌe hemapig hab chuꞌig. Kuki pi ta kuintama idam hemajkam ch ab amjed g wehsko jejewed ch d nahnko mahs oꞌodham ch nahnko kaidam neneokdam.
<sax> They gave a loud shout, “Salvation is from our God who sits on the throne, and from the Lamb.” ||| ch si s-kaidam neneok ch hab kaij:
<sax> All the angels surrounding the throne, and the elders and the four living creatures, fell down on their faces before the throne, worshipping God. ||| Kuki wehsijj g anghil an ha wehgaj gegok ch am i shulig ch ab ihm g Jiosh ch hab ep kaij:
<sax> One of the elders spoke to me and asked, “Who are those who are dressed in white robes, and where have they come from?” ||| Tki hema hegam geꞌeged ab ni-kakke k hab kaij, “Dohꞌo wud idam hemajkam mo s-tohtam e enigadadch ch hebai amjed hihim?”
<sax> I replied, “My Lord, you know the answer.” He told me, “These are the ones who have passed through great persecution. They washed their robes, making them white through the blood of the Lamb. ||| Ni hab kaij ab wui, “Pi ani shaꞌi mahch. Ahpi ap wa s-mahch.”
<sax> When he opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for around half an hour. ||| Tki am hahawa wantsh k kuhpiꞌo g wewaꞌakkokam cheposig hegai mo kahwalkaj ab e chehgidch. Kuki gam hu wabsh i pi shahmuni an dahm kahchim ch ed am huꞌi eda hugkam ohla.
<sax> The smoke of the incense rose together with the prayers of the saints before God from the hand of the angel. ||| Kutki g anghil mehi g s-ap uhwchu. Tki g kuhbs ab amjed am uhgk i chesh wehnadk g ha-hoꞌigeꞌidalig g hemajkam.
<sax> The angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it down upon the earth; there was the sound of thunder, with lightning flashes, and a terrible earthquake. ||| Tki am hahawa bei g mehi ab amjed g iagchulidakud heg hekaj ohla haꞌa k am iawua jewed dahm. Kutki am shaꞌi si kop g tataniki k si s-kaidag. Kuki g wepgi an tohonnod ch g jewed si uꞌugij.
<sax> Then the seven angels holding the seven trumpets prepared to blow them. ||| Tki hegam wewaꞌak anghil mo uꞌa g wewaꞌak kukuikud am i e nako mat wo ku.
<sax> The first angel blew his trumpet. Hail and fire mixed with blood rained down on the earth. One third of the earth was burned up, one third of the trees were burned up and all the green grass was burned up. ||| Tki g wehpeg anghil am si kuhu g e-kuikudkaj. Tki g chea ch mehi wehnadch g ehꞌed ab i e iawua an dahm g jewed. Kutki hemako tahpani mei g jewed mo waik e tahpanch (⅓). Kutki g kukui hab waꞌap masma haꞌas meitto. Tki g washai wehs meitto.
<sax> The second angel blew his trumpet. Something looking like a huge mountain of flaming fire was thrown into the sea. One third of the sea turned to blood, ||| Tki g gokkokam anghil am hahawa epai kuhu g e-kuikudkaj. Tki am haꞌichu e daꞌich ge shuhdagi ch ed ch hab sha mahs mo g ge geꞌe doꞌag ch meihim. Tki hemako tahpani mo waik e tahpanch g ge shuhdagi wabsh e ehꞌedch.
<sax> and one third of the creatures that lived in the sea died, and one third of all ships were destroyed. ||| Tki haꞌakia ep koi g haꞌichu doakam am ge shuhdagi ch ed ch haꞌakia ep wachkk g wapalko am shuhdagi ch ed.
<sax> The third angel blew his trumpet. A great star fell from heaven, blazing brightly. It fell on a third of the rivers and springs of water. ||| Tki g waikkokam anghil am hahawa ep ku. Tki g geꞌe huꞌu ab i gei dahm kahchim t amjed k hab masma meihim mo g kuhchki ch maꞌish g hemako tahpani mo waik e tahpanch g aꞌakimel ch shohshonkam shuhdagi.
<sax> The name of the star is Wormwood, and one third of the water turned bitter,  and many people died from drinking the water because it had become poisonous. ||| K hab chehgig ihda huꞌu S-siwkam. Kutki g hemako tahpani mo waik e tahpanch g shuhdagi wabsh ge siwa. Tki muꞌi hemajkam koi chum iꞌik ihda shuhdagi no pi si s-siw.
<sax> The fifth angel blew his trumpet. I watched a star fall from heaven to earth. He  was given the key to the opening of the Abyss. ||| Tki am hahawa ep kuhu g hetaspokam anghil g e-kuikudkaj. Kuni neid g huꞌu. Tki id am gei jewed dahm ab dahm kahchim t amjed. Kumtki ab mah hegai yahwi mo heg d wuikam wag mo pi hebai hug.
<sax> He opened the entrance to the Abyss, and smoke came up out of the Abyss like the smoke of a huge furnace. The sun and the atmosphere became dark because of the smoke from the Abyss. ||| Kutki ihda huꞌu am kuhpiꞌo hegai wag. Tki g kuhbs hab masma ab i wuhsh mo ab amjed g si geꞌe nahdakud. Kutki g tash tonlig wabsh wehsko chuku heg hekaj kuhbs ab amjed g wag.
<sax> Locusts came out of the smoke onto the earth, and they were given power like that possessed by scorpions. ||| Tki g geꞌeged shoshꞌo ab i huhud amjed g kuhbs an dahm g jewed. Kumtki ab ha mah g gewkdag mat s-koꞌokam wo ha juh hab masma mo g nanakshel.
<sax> They were told not to harm the grass or any vegetation or any trees, only those who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads. ||| Kum hab ha ahg mat pi wo koꞌokam has juh g washai ch kukui ch wehs haꞌichu wuhshanig. Hegam atsh wo waꞌi s-koꞌokam has ha juh hemajkam mo pi ab hu cheposidas e-koka ab heg hekaj Jiosh cheposidakud.
<sax> They were not allowed to kill, but they could torture these people for five months. The torture was like that of a scorpion when it stings someone. ||| Kumtki pi ha hiwigi idam shoshꞌo mat wo ha kokda idam hemajkam k wabshaba wabsh wo s-koꞌokam ha shoꞌigch hetasp mashad ab. Kuki g s-koꞌok ab amjed g ha-shoꞌigchuda hab masma s-koꞌok mo g nakshel keꞌi.
<sax> During that time people will look for death, but won't find it; they will want to die, but death will run away from them! ||| Kutki heg oidam hetasp mashad idam hemajkam wo chum si s-koꞌim k wabshaba pi wo koi.
<sax> The locusts looked like war-horses. They wore what seemed to be golden crowns on their heads, and their faces looked human. ||| Kuki idam shoshꞌo hab mams mo hegam kakawyu mo e hekaj am cheggiadag ch ed. Kuki g ha-mohmi hab mams mo g uꞌuwi ha-mohmi. K an ha-mohmi an wahpkch g ohla gigiko.
<sax> They had long hair like women and had teeth like lions. ||| Kuki g ha-wuhpiosha sha oꞌodham ha-wuhpiosha mams. Kuki g ha-tahtami hab mams mo g mawid tahtami.
<sax> Ruling over them as their king was the angel of the Abyss who is called Abaddon in Hebrew and Apollyon in Greek. ||| Kuki ep ge kownalig.

<sax> The first Disaster is over, but there are still two more to come. ||| Tki am i huhug ihda wehpeg si s-ta ehbidam haꞌichu. K id i dahm matki am hab ep wo e juh g gohk si s-ta ehbidam haꞌichu.
<sax> The sixth angel blew his trumpet. I heard a voice come from the horns of the golden altar that stands in front of God ||| Tki g chuhdpokam anghil am hahawa epai kuhu g e-kuikudkaj. Kuni kah mo ab hema neok ab chuhchpulij amjed hegai ohla iagchulidakud mo am kehk baꞌich g Jiosh.
<sax> speaking to the sixth angel that had the trumpet: “Release the four angels that are tied up beside the great River Euphrates.” ||| K hegai mo ab neok hab kaij heg wui anghil mo d chuhdpokam ch an uꞌukch g kuikud, “Ha g dagito hegam giꞌik anghil mo am e wupulshch heg bahsho akimel mo hab chehgig Euphrates.”
<sax> The four angels who had been kept ready for this particular hour, day, month and year were released to kill one third of humanity. ||| Mtki am i ha dagito idam giꞌik anghil. Idam oki wa e nahtokch id si wehhejed ohla id si tash ed id si mashad ab ch id si ahidag ed mat wo ha kokda g hemako tahpani mo waik e tahpanch wehs hemajkam.
<sax> I was told the number of the army of soldiers on horseback: it was 200 million. ||| Kum am ni-ahgid mash d gohk siant mi-yohn (200,000,000) idam mo g kakawyu ha chehchejch.
<sax> In my vision I saw the horses and their riders who wore breastplates as red as fire, and dark blue and yellow. The heads of the horses looked like lions, and fire and smoke and sulfur streamed out of their mouths. ||| Kuni am ni-tahgio neid g kakawyu ch hegam mo ha chehchejch. Kuki g ha-wainomi koktoni si s-wepegi ch ep s-oꞌam ch hab masma s-chehedagi mo g dahm kahchim. K g kakawyu ha-mohmi hab mams mo g maipid ha-mohmi.

<sax> One third of humanity was killed by these three plagues, by the fire and smoke and sulfur streaming out of their mouths. ||| Tki g hemako tahpani mo waik e tahpanch g hemajkam e koꞌij id hekaj waik haꞌichu mo ab wuhshani ha-chihchini amjed.
<sax> They did not repent of their murders, their witchcraft, their sexual sins, or their thefts. ||| Idam hemajkam atki pi shaꞌi dagito g e-muꞌadag ch e-hihoina ch haꞌichu ehsig ch hegai mo s-tohntom haꞌichu wua aꞌai e wehm.
<sax> Then I saw another powerful angel descending from heaven, with a cloud wrapped around him and with a rainbow over his head. His face looked like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire. ||| Ntki hahawa ab nei matki ab hema i hud g s-gewk anghil ab dahm kahchim amjed.

<sax> He was holding a small scroll that had already been opened. He placed his right foot on the sea, and this left foot on the land. ||| Id oki g s-apko e-tadkaj am keishch g ge shuhdagi ch g s-ohgig e-tadkaj am keishch g jewed. Kuki an hab chuꞌig g oꞌohana nowij ed ch pi holiwkas.
<sax> He gave a great shout, like a lion roaring. When he shouted, the seven thunders responded. ||| Kuki am si s-kaidam neok ch hab sha kaidag mo g mawid ab todk. Kutki g wewaꞌak tataniki ab hahawa uhpam neneo todkch.
<sax> When the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write down what they said when I heard a voice from heaven that told me, “Keep under seal what the seven thunders said. Don't write them down.” ||| Nt am haha wabsh wo i chum oꞌoha. Tki wabshaba ab hema neo dahm kahchim t amjed k hab kaij, “Pi g am hedai shaꞌi ahgid mo has kaij idam wewaꞌak tataniki. Pi g an hu shaꞌi oꞌohan.”
<sax> The angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land held up his right hand to heaven. ||| Kutki ihda anghil mo an dahm kehk g ge kahchki ch jewed ab si uhgk i bei g s-apkojed e-nowi ab dahm kahchim wui
<sax> He made a sacred oath by the One who lives for ever and ever, who created the heavens and everything in them, and the earth and everything in it, and the sea and everything in it. “No more delay!” he said. ||| k hab kaij, “Jiosh o chum hekid an haꞌichug ch nahto g dahm kahchim ch jewed kahchim ch ge kahchki ch wehs haꞌichu mo am ha eda idam k hab kaij mat am wa e ai mat geꞌe haꞌichu hab wo e juh.
<sax> But at the time when the seventh angel speaks, when he blows his trumpet, then the mystery of God will be completed—the good news he announced through his servants the prophets. ||| Wewaꞌakkokam anghil at am wo kuhu g e-kuikudkaj. T am hab haha wo juh g Jiosh g s-aꞌagi e-apchuda mo wa am ha ahgid hegam e-pionagbad mo d Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam.”
<sax> I took the little scroll from the angel and ate it up. In my mouth it was as sweet as honey, but it was sour in my stomach. ||| Nt ab bei g al oꞌohana nowij ab k huh. K s-wohom si s-iꞌowi mant huh. Nt wabshaba am i bah. T hahawa si siwa am ni-wohk ed.
<sax> I was told, “You must prophesy again regarding many peoples, nations, languages, and kings.” ||| Kum ab hahawa ep ni-ahgid ihda, “Am apt ep wo oꞌoha g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ab ha amjed muꞌi nahnko mahs mehk jewed dakam hemajkam ch kokownal ch nahnko kaidam neneokdam.”
<sax> I was given a measuring rod and told, “Get up and measure the Temple of God, and the altar, and count those who are worshiping there. ||| Kumtki ab hahawa hema ni-mah g kuintakud uhs k hab ni-ahg, “I g wuhshani k an kuint g Jiosh cheopiga ch g iagchulidakud k wo ha kuint hegam mo am e hoꞌigeꞌidahun Jiosh wui amai.
<sax> Don't measure the court outside the Temple, leave that, because it has been handed over to the nations. They will trample down the holy city for forty-two months. ||| T wabshaba hegai mo an wehgaj kolhaitas am i e dagito ha wui g nahnko mahs hemajkam. Pt pi an hu has wo i juh.

<sax> I will give my two witnesses power, and they will prophesy 1,260 days, dressed in sackcloth.” ||| Jiosh o hab kaij, “Gohk ant wo ha mah g ni-pionag g gewkdag.

<sax> They are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks that stand in front of the Lord of the earth. ||| Neh, t am hahawa ni-chehgi matki has wo masmak idam gohk. Kutki hab wo masmak mo hegam gohk olive uꞌus wuhshanig mo wa heki hu oꞌohanas ab ha amjed ch hab ep wo masmak mo hegam gohk lalampa mo am chuhch geꞌe cheopi ch ed.
<sax> If anyone tries to harm them, fire comes out of their mouths and burns up their enemies. This is how anyone who tries to harm them will be killed. ||| Kuki g mehi ab i wushke ha-chihchini amjed ch ha kokda g ha-obga. Kut hedai wo i chum s-koꞌokam has ha juh k wo e kokda.
<sax> These two witnesses have the power to close the sky so that it will not rain during the time of their prophecy. They also have the power to turn the waters into blood, and to strike the earth with all kinds of plagues, as often as they want. ||| Ab oki mahks g apꞌedag mat wo kuh g dahm kahchim.

Ab oki ep mahks g apꞌedag mat wo ehꞌedch g shohshonkam shuhdagi k an wo i wuhshad g nahnko mahs si shoꞌigdag ch mumkidag ia jewed dahm.
<sax> For three and a half days those from the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will look at their dead bodies, and will not allow their corpses to be buried. ||| Wehs nahnko kaidam neneokdam an wehs jewed dahm atki wo ha neidad mat idam gohk am wo wehchk waik eda hugkam tash. Kumtki pi wo ha hiwigi mamt ged hu wo ha hihash.
<sax> The inhabitants of the earth are delighted they are dead, and celebrate, sending gifts to each other, because these two prophets had been a torment to them. ||| Tki g hemajkam wo si s-hehgigk mat koi ch wo pipiast k ab aꞌai wo e mah g haꞌichu mahkigdag noki pi ha shoꞌigchud idam gohk.
<sax> But three and half days later God's life-giving breath entered them and they stood on their feet. Those who saw this were absolutely terrified. ||| Am i dahm g waik eda hugkam tash, ni am neid matki g Jiosh ab haha wo i ha mah g doakag. Tki wo gegokiwua.

<sax> The two witnesses heard a loud voice from heaven telling them, “Come up here!” So they ascended to heaven in a cloud while their enemies watched. ||| Kutki idam gohk wo kah mo ab hema si neok ab dahm kahchim t amjed ch hab kaij, “Ab g wo i hihim.” Kutki am wo i chehchsh dahm kahchim wui am chewagi ch ed am ha-neidag ed g e-obga.
<sax> At the same time there was a huge earthquake, and one tenth of the city collapsed. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven. ||| Tki am waꞌi hekaj am si s-gewkam wo uꞌugij g jewed.

<sax> The seventh angel blew his trumpet, and loud voices shouted in heaven, “The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ, and he shall reign for ever and ever.” ||| Kut g wewaꞌakkokam anghil am hahawa kuhu g e-kuikudkaj.

<sax> The twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones in God's presence fell down on their faces and worshipped God. ||| Kutki hegam gokko gamai giꞌik geꞌeged ab i shulig k gd hu si kokawua k ab ihm g Jiosh
<sax> Then an amazing sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and a crown of twelve stars on her head. ||| Am atki hahawa haꞌichu si geꞌe e chehgi an dahm kahchim ch ed.

<sax> She was pregnant, and she cried out because of her labor pains, groaning as she was giving birth. ||| Kutki wo ge madt. Tki ab i hihhi g s-koꞌok matki wo mahmadho. K hekaj am si shoshshak.
<sax> Another sign appeared in heaven: a great red dragon with seven heads and ten horns, with seven small crowns on his heads. ||| Am atki hahawa haꞌichu ep i e chehgi dahm kahchim ch ed.

<sax> His tail swept away a third of the stars of heaven and threw them down to the earth. The dragon stood right in front of the woman who was giving birth, so that he could eat her child as soon as it was born. ||| Kutki g e-baikaj i ha chewaim g hemako tahpani mo waik e tahpanch g huhuꞌu k im hu hab i ha juh ab dahm kahchim amjed ch am ha nehnich jewed dahm.

<sax> There was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought with the dragon. The dragon and his angels fought  but he was not strong enough, and they could no longer remain in heaven. ||| Tki an haha wabsh g cheggiadag hab e juh Jiosh kihdag ed.

<sax> The great dragon, the ancient serpent called the Devil and Satan who deceives the whole world, was thrown down to the earth, and his angels with him. ||| Ihda Nehbig Hujud atki gam hu si e wua ab amjed g dahm kahchim.

<sax> So celebrate, heaven, and everyone who lives there! Mourn, earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you and is very angry, knowing his time is short.” ||| T wo si s-hehgigk wehsijj hegam mo am haꞌichug Jiosh kihdag ed.

<sax> When the dragon realized he had been thrown down to the earth, he persecuted the woman that had given birth to the male child. ||| Pegih, am amtki wa daꞌich jewed dahm ihda Nehbig Hujud mo d Jiawul. Tki wa eda heki hu madt hegai uwi. T g Nehbig Hujud an ha hekaj i huꞌui.
<sax> The woman was given the wings of a large eagle so she could fly away to a deserted place where she could be looked after for a time, times, and half a time, protected from the serpent. ||| Kumtki ab aꞌanch g uwi g baꞌag aꞌankaj mat gam hu wo daꞌa k gan hu wo e ehstokch tohono jewed ch ed. Kumtki am wo nuhkudad waik eda hugkam aꞌahidag mat g Nehbig Hujud pi wo mua.
<sax> The serpent spewed water like a river out of his mouth, trying to sweep her away in the flood. ||| Tki g Nehbig Hujud ab haha wabsh i iawua g shuhdagi e-chini amjed am oidk hegai uwi mat gam hu wo i chum moht.
<sax> The earth came to the woman's aid by opening its mouth and swallowing up the river that the dragon spewed out of his mouth. ||| Tki wabshaba g jewed ab i wehmt g uwi, heg wa wepo mat ab i kuhpiꞌo g e-chini k im hu bah hegai shuhdagi mo ab daꞌiwuni Nehbig Hujud chini amjed.
<sax> The dragon was furious with the woman, and went off to attack the rest of her offspring, those who keep God's commandments and have the testimony of Jesus. ||| Tki haha wabsh wohoꞌi bagat g Nehbig Hujud ab wui g uwi k amjed am i ha cheggia hegam mo ab d amjedkamaj.

<sax>  ||| Kuki am hahawa kehk g Nehbig Hujud ge shuhdagi koa an.
<sax> And the dragon stood on the sea shore. Then I saw a beast rising out of the sea. He had ten horns and seven heads, with ten small crowns on his horns, and had blasphemous names on his heads. ||| Ntki haha wabsh nei hegai s-ta Ehbidamakam oꞌodham mo e wepogidch g mischini haꞌichu doakam.

<sax> and they worshiped the dragon because he had given his authority to the beast; and they worshiped the beast, asking “Who is like the beast? Who could defeat him?” ||| k ab ep ihm g s-ta Ehbidamakam ch hab kaij, “Pi oki hedai hab shaꞌi masma mo ihda. Pi atki hedai wo shaꞌi e nako mat wo cheggia.”
<sax> He was given the ability  to make great boasts and speak blasphemies, and he was also given the authority to do this for forty-two months. ||| Kum wabsh hiwgid ihda mat wo si pi kehg neokad. Kumtki ab ep mah g gewkdag am oidam g giꞌikko wehst-mahm gamai gohk (42) mashad.
<sax> As soon as he opened his mouth he spoke blasphemies against God, insulting his character,  his sanctuary,  and those who live in heaven. ||| Kut ihda am ha hekaj pad neo ab wui g Jiosh k pi ap hekaj g chehgigaj ch nahnko ahg g Jiosh kihdag ch hegam mo an kih kihdaj ed.
<sax> The beast was given power to attack believers and defeat them, and he was also given authority over every people, tribe, language, and nation. ||| Ab amtki hiwigi mat wo ha cheggia g Jiosh hemajkamga k wo ha gewito. Kumt ab ep mah g gewkdag am ha dahm g wehsko dakam hemajkam mo has i kaidam d neneokdam.
<sax> Everybody living on earth will worship him, those whose names had not been written in the book of life—the book of life that belongs to the Lamb slain from the beginning of the world. ||| K wabshaba g Jiosh hemajkamga ha chechgig o an oꞌohadag e doꞌibiakam ha-oꞌohana ed.

<sax> If you have ears, listen! ||| Am g wo s-ap i aꞌamichud ihda.
<sax> Anyone who has to go into captivity will go into captivity; anyone who has to die by the sword will die by the sword. This demonstrates the patient endurance and confidence in God of the believers. ||| Hegam mo hedai d ha wuikam mat wo e kuhpach at hemho wa wo e kuhpach.

<sax> Then I saw another beast, rising up from the earth. He had two horns like a lamb, but he spoke like a dragon. ||| Ni hahawa ep neid matki ab hema ep i wuhsh ged hu jewed wecho amjed. Id o hab waꞌap mahs mo g s-ta ehbidamakam haꞌichu doakam ch ge gohk aꞌag hab sha masma mo g kahwal aꞌag ch hab masma neok mo g nehbig hujud.
<sax> He was permitted to breathe life into the image of the beast so that it could speak, ordering anyone who did not worship it put to death. ||| Hegai s-chu Iattomakam Haꞌichu i Tashogiddam atki am ihbheiwua id eda mat am e nahto.

<sax> Nobody was permitted to buy or sell except those who had the mark, which was the name of the beast or the number of his name. ||| Pi atki hedai wo e nako mas haꞌichu wo ha nolawt o haꞌichu wo gagda, heg hi wa mat ab wo cheposigk g s-ta Ehbidamakam chehgigkaj o heg hekaj nuhmilo mo d chehgigaj nuhmilo.
<sax> Wisdom is needed here. Whoever has understanding should calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. His number is 666. ||| Id oki d si s-juhk haꞌichu.

<sax> I looked, and saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion. With him were 144,000 who had his name, and the name of his Father, written on their foreheads. ||| Ntki ab ep nei Kuki hegai mo kahwalkaj ab e chehgidch an kehk Sion doꞌag t ab.

<sax> I heard a voice from heaven that sounded like rushing water and loud thunder and many harps being played. ||| Kuni kah mo ab hema neok dahm kahchim t amjed ch hab kaidag mo g geꞌe shuhdagi s-kaidam med ch hab kaidag mo g tataniki an doahim. Hegai mani kah o hab kaidag mo muꞌi aꞌalpa am e gew.
<sax> They sang a new song in front of the throne and the four living creatures and the elders. Nobody could learn the song except the 144,000, those who had been redeemed from the earth. ||| Hegam hemajkam mani wa ha neid oki am ahg g wechij neꞌi ch am gegok wui hegai kownal daikud ch hegam ha wui giꞌik haꞌichu doakam ch hegam geꞌeged. Kutki pi hedai ep wo e nako mas wo mai g ha-nei.
<sax> They have not become morally impure by sinning with women; spiritually they are virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They were redeemed from humankind as the firstfruits to God and the Lamb. ||| Idam oki d hegam mat pi shaꞌi ha hohont k si e nuhkud mo pi ha wehm wohppo. Kut am ha wehhejed e muhkid hegai mo kahwalkaj ab e chehgidch k ha doꞌibia. Kuki idam an oidahim mo hebai i oimmed ch d wehpegkam e doꞌibiakam.
<sax> He cried out in a loud voice, “Give God reverence and glory, for the time of his judgment has come. Worship the One who made heaven and earth and sea and springs of water.” ||| Si o s-kaidam hab kaij, “Ab g wo si has elid g Jiosh ch ab ihm. E at ai mat wo ha lodai g hemajkam.

<sax> A second angel followed, calling out, “Babylon the great has collapsed into ruins! She made all the nations drink the wine of her sexual immorality that brings God's furious opposition.” ||| Tki am hahawa hema ep i oi hegai wehpeg anghil k hab kaij, “I at gei ihda geꞌe kihhim.

<sax> A third angel followed the first two, and cried out in a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on their forehead or on their hand,  they will also drink of the wine of God's furious opposition that is poured undiluted into the cup of his anger,  and they will suffer anguish in fire and burning sulfur before the holy angels and the Lamb. ||| Tki g waikkokam anghil am i ha oi hegam gohk k si s-kaidam hab kaij, “T wo ha mah g Jiosh g s-koꞌok namkidadag wehs hegam mo hedai ab si has elid hegai s-ta Ehbidamakam ch ab chechposidas heg hekaj cheposigaj e-koka ab o an e-nohnhoi an.

<sax> The smoke of their anguish ascends for ever and ever. They don't have any relief day or night, those who worship the beast and his image and who receive the mark of his name.” ||| T g kuhbdaj hegai mehi mat s-koꞌokam wo ha mehi am wo wuhshanid uhgk iaꞌi amjed ch chum hekid.

<sax> This means the believers must patiently endure, keeping God's commandments and trusting in Jesus. ||| Id att hekaj hemho wo wa si s-chu nakogad ahchim mach d Jiosh hemajkamga ch ab s-wohog elid g Jiosh chehanig ch am s-gewkam oid g Jesus.
<sax> Then I heard a voice from heaven that told me, “Write this down! Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Yes, says the Spirit, because they can rest from their troubles. What they have accomplished will speak for them.” ||| Ni hahawa hema ep kah. Kuki id ab neok dahm kahchim t amjed ch hab kaij mantsh an wo oꞌoha ihda, “T wo si s-ap e taht hegam mat wo koi, ab s-wohochudch mo g Jesus d ha-kownalig.”
<sax> I looked and I saw a white cloud. Sitting on the cloud was someone that looked like the Son of man, wearing a golden crown on his head and holding a sharp sickle in his hand. ||| Ntki hahawa nei g s-toa chewagi. Kuki an id dahm hema dak ch hab mahs mo g Jiosh si Kehsha. K g ohla gihko ab e wahkch moꞌoj ab. K an uꞌukch g s-muꞌuk ohso.
<sax> Another angel came out of the Temple and shouted in a loud voice to the one sitting on the cloud, “Take your sickle and start reaping, for it is harvest-time, and earth's harvest is ripe.” ||| T ab hema i wuhsh g anghil ab amjed g geꞌe cheopi k ab si s-kaidam neok ch hab kaij heg wui mo an da chewagi ch ed, “Heg o wa wepogidas mapt an wo hikkumia g uhdwis bahidag g e-ohsokaj am wehsko jewed dahm. E at ai g geꞌe lodaita tash. Kupt am wo i ha hemapai g hemajkam heg wehhejed.”
<sax> He was followed by an angel coming from the altar that was in charge of the fire, who called in a loud voice to the angel with the sharp sickle, “Take your sharp sickle and harvest the bunches of grapes from the earth's vine, because its grapes are ripe.” ||| K am hema ep kehk g anghil ch am nuhkud g nahda ab ab g iagchulidakud.

<sax> The angel swung his sickle on the earth and harvested the grapes from the vine, and threw them into the great winepress of God's judgment. ||| Kut wa woho ab i widu g anghil g e-ohso an jewed dahm k am hikkumia g uhdwis k am ha shul kehiwinakud ch ed. Id o am chehgidch mat g Jiosh s-koꞌokam wo ha namkid.
<sax> They were trampled in the winepress outside the city. Blood flowed out of the winepress to the height of a horse's bridle, and to a distance of 1,600 stadia. ||| Kum ha kehiwia g uhdwis gam hu jeg ed ab amjed g kihhim.

<sax> Then I saw another amazing, important sign in heaven. Seven angels held the seven last plagues which complete God's judgment. ||| Ntki hahawa ep nei g si geꞌe chehgida an dahm kahchim ch ed.

<sax> I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire. Standing beside the sea of glass were those who had defeated the beast and his image and the number of his name. They had harps given to them by God ||| Neid ani mo am haꞌichu tadani ch hab sha mahs mo g mi-lihda ch g mehi wehnags.

<sax> and they sang the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb: “What you have done is tremendous and marvelous, O Lord God, the All-powerful One. Your ways are right and true, King of the nations. ||| Mosesbad ch hegai mo kahwalkaj ab e chehgidch oki ab ha mahkch g neꞌi. K id am aꞌaga:
<sax> After this I looked and the Temple of the “Tent of Witness” was opened. ||| Am i dahm ani hahawa ep neid moki ab kuhpiꞌokas g Jiosh cheopiga an dahm kahchim ch ed. Kuki heg eda am haꞌichug hegai ikus kih mo hab d ahga mo g Jiosh am ha wehmaj g e-hemajkamga.
<sax> Out of the Temple came the seven angels who held the seven plagues, wearing clean, white linen clothes and golden sashes on their chests. ||| Tki ab i wuwha g wewaꞌak anghil k uꞌa g wewaꞌak si oidchkam shoꞌigdag ab amjed g cheopi. Idam anghil oki si s-kehg s-tohtam e enigadadch ch g ohla babshodag an hab juhkch e-babsho an.
<sax> Then I heard a loud voice coming from the Temple telling the seven angels, “Go and pour out the seven bowls of God's judgment on the earth.” ||| Kuni wa hema ep kah.

<sax> So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and terrible, painful sores broke out on those who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his image. ||| Tki g wehpegkam anghil am him k am iawua an dahm g jewed hegai mo wasibch e-hoas-haꞌa ch ed.

<sax> The second poured out his bowl on the sea, and it became like the blood of a corpse and everything living in the sea died. ||| Tki amjed g gokkokam anghil am hahawa epai iawua hegai mo wasibch an ge shuhdagi dahm.

<sax> The third poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs of water, and the water turned into blood. ||| Tki amjed g waikkokam anghil am epai iawua hegai mo wasibch an aꞌakimel ch ed ch shohshonkam shuhdagi ch ed. Kutki e ehꞌedch g shuhdagi.
<sax> I heard the angel who had power over the waters declare, “You are truly right, you who are and was, the Holy One, as this judgment demonstrates. ||| Kuni kah mo hab kaij ab Jiosh wui hegai anghil mo nuhkud g shuhdagi:
<sax> I heard a voice from the altar saying, “Yes, O Lord God, the All-powerful One, your judgments are right and true!” ||| Niki amjed hahawa hema ep kah. K id ab neok iagchulidakud amjed ch hab kaij, “T-kownalig Jiosh, dap si s-gewkdagkam. K g m-lodaita si woho ch si s-apꞌe.”
<sax> The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was given the power to scorch people with fire. ||| Tki amjed g giꞌikkokam anghil am iawua hegai mo wasibch an tash t an. Kut ha mehi g hemajkam g e-s-tonikaj.
<sax> They were scorched by intense heat, and they cursed the name of God who controlled these plagues. They did not repent and give him glory. ||| T eda idam pi gam hu s-ohhod g pi ap e-chegitoi. Jiosh o ha hiwgid mat wo e shoꞌigch. K heg hekaj ab si s-koꞌokam has ahg ch pi ab hu has elid g gewkdaj.
<sax> The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the mighty River Euphrates, and its water was dried up, so that a way could be prepared for the kings that come from the east. ||| Tki amjed g chuhdpokam anghil am iawua hegai mo wasibch heg eda ge akimel mo hab chehgig Euphrates. Tki gaksh ihda mat ab gahi wo i huhud g kokownal ab siꞌal wecho amjed.

<sax> The evil spirits gathered the kings for battle at a place called Armageddon in Hebrew. ||| Tki amjed hegam waik gewpkdag am ha uꞌapa g kokownal amai mo g Tutuligo hab aꞌaga Armageddon.
<sax> The seventh angel poured out his bowl on the air, and a loud voice came from the Temple, from the throne, shouting out, “It's over!” ||| Tki amjed g wewaꞌakkokam anghil am iawua hegai mo wasibch an hewel ch ed.

<sax> Lightning flashed and thunder boomed, and a massive earthquake shook the earth. It was the worst earthquake that had ever happened since people lived there. ||| Tki am si tohonno g wepgi k am si kokp g tataniki. Tki g jewed si s-gewkam uꞌugij.

<sax> The great city was split into three. The cities of the nations were destroyed. Babylon the great was remembered in God's presence so that she should be given the cup filled with the wine of his hostility. ||| Tki hegai geꞌe kihhim waikpa e tahp.

<sax> One of the seven angels with the seven bowls came and talked with me. “Come here,” he said, “and I will show you the judgment of the infamous prostitute that sits  beside many waters. ||| T amjed hegam hema wewaꞌak anghil mo an uhꞌukch g wewaꞌak hohas-hahaꞌa am jiwia ni-wui k hab kaij, “Ab g i hihm k neid ihda geꞌe kihhim mo am miabidch kehk g muꞌi aꞌakimel ch heg wepogidas mo g si pi apꞌekam chehpaꞌawi.

<sax> The kings of the earth have committed adultery with her, and those who live on the earth became drunk on the wine of her immorality.” ||| Kokownal wehsko jewed dahm at heg hekaj hab wo juh g pi apꞌekam.

<sax> Then he carried me off in the Spirit to a deserted place, and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that had seven heads and ten horns and was covered in blasphemous names. ||| T g Hekia S-apꞌekam Gewkdag ab si i ni-wehmt.

<sax> The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and wore jewelry made of gold and gems and pearls. She held in her hand a golden cup full of obscene things and her disgusting immorality. ||| Ihda uwi o si s-ihbhaimagim ch s-wegima e enigadadch ch g ohlakaj ch s-kehg hohodaikaj e hehosidch.

<sax> A name of mystery was written on her forehead: Babylon the Great, the Mother of Prostitutes and of the World's Obscene Things. ||| Ab koaj ab o oꞌohadag g chehgig.

<sax> I saw that the woman was drunk on the blood of believers, and on the blood of martyrs who had died for Jesus. When I saw her, I was totally amazed. ||| Neid ani mat shaꞌi si s-ap e taht ihda uwi mat e koꞌij hegam mat pi dagito g Jesus. Heg o wa wepo mat nawm iꞌok g ha-ehꞌed.
<sax> The angel asked me, “Why were you amazed? I will explain to you the mystery of the woman and the beast she rode which has seven heads and ten horns. ||| K ab ni-kakke g anghil ch hab kaij, “Shahchu apt ahgk si has e taht. Am ant wo m-ahgi mo has d ahga ihda map s-neidma.
<sax> The beast you saw once was but is not, however will soon come up again out of the Abyss, and will then be completely destroyed. Those that live on the earth who don't have their names written in the book of life will be amazed when they see the beast that once was but is not, and yet shall return. ||| Ihda s-ta Ehbidamakam mo wewaꞌak mohmi ch wehst-mahm aꞌag o d chum doakamkahim ch hahawa e muhkid k wabshaba ep wo e chegito k ab wo i wuhsh s-juhk wag t amjed k hahawa ep wo e muhkid.

<sax> The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not begun to reign yet. However they will be given authority to reign as kings together with the beast for one hour. ||| “Hegam wehst-mahm aꞌag map neid o hab d ahga mat wehst-mahm kokownal ab ep wo i wuwha.

<sax> The ten horns that you saw and the beast will detest the prostitute, and will take away everything she has and strip her naked, eat her flesh and burn her to ashes. For God put into their minds to do what he wanted, to have one agreed purpose: to give their kingdom to the beast—and so God's words will be fulfilled. ||| Kut g Jiosh hab wo ha juh hegam wehst-mahm kokownal mat ab wo wechokad g s-ta Ehbidamakam.

<sax> After this I saw another angel descending from heaven. He had great power  and the earth was lit up by his glory. ||| Am i dahm, ni hahawa ep neid g anghil. Tki id ab i hud dahm kahchim t amjed k geꞌe uꞌukch g gewkdag. K ab amjed g tonlig wabsh wehsko tonod an jewed dahm.

<sax> He seized the dragon, the ancient serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, and bound him in chains for one thousand years. ||| K am daha g Nehbig Hujud ch d ge Jiawul ch hab chehgig Satan. Tki g anghil an si wulshp
<sax> The angel threw him into the Abyss and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he would no longer be able to deceive the nations until the thousand years were over. After that he has to be set free for a little while. ||| k am daꞌich heg eda s-juhk wag k ab si yahwidad k ab ep si bidsh.

<sax> I saw people sitting on thrones who had been given the responsibility to judge, and the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony about Jesus and for sharing the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or his image, nor had they received the mark on their foreheads or their hands. They lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. ||| Kuni hahawa ep neid g kokownal dadaikud ch hegam mo an dadha. Idam amtki ab ha mah g gewkdag mat d wo uꞌusagakamk.

<sax> This is the first resurrection. (The rest of the dead did not live again until the thousand years had ended.)  Blessed and holy are those who take part in the first resurrection! The second death has no power over them. They will be priests of God, and of Christ, and they will reign with him for one thousand years. ||| Hegam mat wehpeg ab wo i wuwha muhkig amjed at wo si s-hehgigk ch wo si s-ap e tahtkkad ch pi am hu gahi ep wo wuwha g muhkig.

<sax> and will go out to deceive the nations, symbolized by Gog and Magog, to gather them together for battle from the four corners of the world.

<sax> I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and the books were opened. Another book, the Book of Life, was opened and the dead were judged based on what was written in the books about what they had done. ||| Kuni ha neid hegam mo d koꞌi ch d nahnko i mahs hemajkam.

<sax> But anyone who is a coward, who doesn't trust me, who does disgusting things, who is a murderer, who is sexually immoral, who practices witchcraft, who worships idols, who tells lies—their chosen place is in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur. This is the second death.” ||| T wabshaba wo e nehnich mei kahchki ch ed g s-chu ehbidkam ch pi wohochuddam ch hegam mo loligog ch chum e uꞌuwichud o chum e chechojchud ch ha muꞌadkam ch totonto ch s-chu hihoinkam ch s-chu iꞌattomkam ch hegam mo wabsh g oꞌodham nahtoi ha jijoshchud.

<sax> You are also included among those who were called to belong to Jesus Christ. I'm writing to all of you in Rome who are loved by God, and called to be his special people. Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ! ||| Ni am wa kah mamtsh haꞌi ahpim Rome t am hemajkam ab i s-wohoch.

<sax> Let me begin by saying that I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because the way in which you trust in God is spoken about all over the world. ||| Wehsko o am e aꞌaga mamtsh ab i s-wohoch g Jesus Christ. Ni heg hekaj ab si hoꞌigeꞌid g Jiosh.
<sax> I'm always praying for you, as God can confirm—the God I serve with all my heart as I share the good news about his Son.  In my prayers I'm always asking that I might eventually come and see you, if that's what God wants. ||| Wehs ni-ihbdag amjed ani chikpanid g Jiosh am ahgachugch g s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj ab amjed g alidaj.

<sax> I want you to know, my brothers and sisters, I often planned to visit you, but I was kept from coming up till now. I want to see some good spiritual results among you just as I've seen among other people. ||| Am g wo s-mahchk mani muꞌikko am aꞌapꞌechud mant am wo i em-chehgim.

<sax> For I have an obligation to work for both the civilized and the uncivilized, both the educated and the uneducated. ||| Ab o ni-chehani g Jiosh mant wo ha ahgi g wehs nahnko mahs hemajkam ihda s-kehg haꞌichu ahgaj, chum wa hems hegam mo pi chu aꞌamichud ch hegam mo d mischini.
<sax> That's why I'm really keen to come to Rome and share the good news with you. ||| Ni heg hekaj ni-nahtokch mant am epai wo i em-ahgidahi ahpim mam am kih Rome t am.
<sax> I'm certainly not ashamed about the good news, for it's God's power to save everyone who trusts in him—to the Jewish people first, and then to everyone else as well. ||| Wehs at wo ha doꞌibia g Jiosh hegam mat ab wo i s-wohoch ihda s-kehg haꞌichu ahga ab amjed g Jesus Christ. Kuni heg hekaj wabsh si s-ap ni-tahtk ch am ahgachug. Tutuligo at wehpeg ab bei e-apꞌedag mat wo e doꞌibia k g gawul mahs hemajkam ab hahawa bei.
<sax> For in the good news God is revealed as good and right,  trustworthy from start to finish. As Scripture says, “Those who are right with God live by trusting him.” ||| Jiosh haꞌichu ahga o am t-tashogidch mat hedai g Jiosh am wo i apꞌech e wehhejed. An o oꞌohadag:
<sax> God's hostility is revealed from heaven against those who are godless and are not right, those who suppress the truth through the evil that they do.  What can be known about God is obvious, because he has made it very clear to them. ||| Ab o t‑wui i e tashogid g Jiosh. K wabshaba muꞌi hemajkam gam hu hab i juhkch ch hab junihim g pi apꞌekam. K ihda pi apꞌekam an kuhpahim mat wo s‑e mai g wohokam. T g Jiosh heg hekaj s‑koꞌokam wo ha namkid.
<sax> Ever since the creation of the world, the invisible aspects of God—his eternal power and divinity—are clearly visible in what he has made. Such people have no excuse, ||| Tt wo chum s‑mahchk mo has chuꞌig g Jiosh am neidch g nahtoij no pi id am chum t‑tashogid mo g Jiosh wehs haꞌichu dahm hab chuꞌig ch wehs edgid g gewkdag chum hekid. Kut hemho wa ab wo moht g e‑chuꞌijig matp hedai pi wo mahchim.
<sax> because even though they knew God, they did not praise him or thank him, but instead their thinking about God turned into complete foolishness, and darkness filled their empty minds. ||| Neh, wehs hemajkam o wa chum s‑mahch mo an hema d Jiosh ch wabsh pi ab hu mahkch g has elidadag. Ab o s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌid. K wabshaba pi ab hu i hoꞌigeꞌelid ch wabsh pehegi haꞌichu chegito. K am wabsh i s‑chuhugam g ha‑chegitoidag.
<sax> and in the same way the men gave up sex with women and burned with lust for each other. Men did indecent things to each other, and as a result they suffered the inevitable consequences of their perversions. ||| K g chechoj pi ha hohont ch e wehm hab waꞌap wua g s‑ta edam haꞌichu. Kut heg hekaj wo si s‑koꞌokam ha namkid g Jiosh.
<sax> Since they didn't consider it worthwhile to get to know God, he abandoned them to their worthless, distrustful way of thinking, doing things that should never be done. ||| Pi o tatchua idam mas wo s‑mahchk g Jiosh. T g Jiosh heg hekaj am wabsh i ha dagito pi kehg ha‑chegitoidag ed. K am hab wua hegai mat haschu pi am hu hab wo chum wuad.
<sax> They filled themselves with all that's wrong: evil, greed, hate, envy, murder, quarreling, deception, malice, and gossip. ||| Ab at wabsh i si ha shuhd g nahnko mahs pi apꞌekam mo haꞌi si pihk e elid g s‑kaisdagkaj ch haꞌi s‑ta kekꞌeidama o s‑chu hehgamk o s‑ha muꞌamk o s‑chu cheggiamk o s‑chu iꞌattomk o s‑chu padhog ehꞌelidamk o s‑chu ahgamk.
<sax> They're back-stabbers and God-haters. They're arrogant, proud, and boastful. They devise new ways of sinning. They rebel against their parents. ||| Haꞌi o s‑koꞌokam has e ahg o s‑ta koꞌokdama o chum si e hahaschud o si i e nakog mat am baꞌich hab wo i juh g pi apꞌekam o pi ab hu wohog ha elid g e‑geꞌegedga

<sax> Even though they realize exactly what God requires, they do things that deserve death. Not only do they do such things themselves, they also support others in doing them. ||| Jiosh chehanig o hab chuꞌig mat hema hab wo masmak ch ab wo nako g s‑koꞌok e‑namkidadag. K idam am wa chum s‑mahch ihda ch eda am hab wa masma hab e junihim ch wabsh s‑hohhoꞌid mo haꞌijj am hab waꞌap e junihim.
<sax> So if you judge others you don't have any excuse, whoever you are! For in whatever way you condemn others, you're judging yourself, because you're doing the same things. ||| Naꞌams haꞌijj ahpim hab kaij “Hah, shoꞌo waꞌi si pi ap d hehemajkam hegam map am ha aꞌaga k ch hemho wa wo bei g s‑koꞌok e‑namkidadag,” ch amtp eda hems hab waꞌap junihim ihda. Neh, m wabsh hejel e‑neꞌokikaj ab e mohtoꞌid g s‑koꞌok e‑namkidadag.
<sax> We know that God's judgment on those who do such things is based on truth. ||| S‑mahch ach mo d wabsh i si shel mat wo ha lodai g Jiosh hegam mo hab wua hegai mani am em‑ahgid.
<sax> Due to your hard-hearted attitude and your refusal to repent, you're making things far worse for yourself on the day of retribution when the rightness of God's judgment is demonstrated. ||| K wabshaba muꞌijj pi ab hu kaimk g Jiosh ch pi shaꞌi pihk e elid hekaj. Idam o baꞌich i geꞌe ab e mohtoꞌidahim hegai s‑koꞌok namkidadag mat wo nam geꞌe lodaita tash ch ed.
<sax> God will make sure everyone receives what they deserve according to what they've done. ||| Heg at i tash ed wo t‑namkid g Jiosh heg hekaj mach haschu hab i junihim.
<sax> Those who have kept on trying to do what is right will receive glory and honor, immortality and eternal life. ||| Heg att wo cheh mach haschu i gahg. Am g hab wo junihid g s‑apꞌekam ch wo e gahgidad g Jiosh apꞌechuda. T g Jiosh am wo i em‑wahpki e‑kihdag ed mamt chum hekid an wo wehmajk.
<sax> But those who think only of themselves, rejecting the truth and deliberately choosing to do evil, will receive punishment and furious hostility. ||| Muꞌi hemajkam o wabsh hejel e tatchua ch hab junihim g pi apꞌekam. T idam g Jiosh ab wo ha mah g s‑koꞌok ha‑namkidadag.
<sax> Everyone who does evil will have trouble and suffering—the Jewish people first, and the foreigners too. ||| Kut ab wo tahtkkad g shoꞌigdag ch s‑koꞌok, wahm g Tutuligo matp pi hab hu wo kaiha hegai mo haschu t‑nuhkudachud g Jiosh.
<sax> But everyone who does good will have glory, honor, and peace—the Jewish people first, and the foreigners too. ||| T g Jiosh ab wo si t‑haꞌichuch ahchim mach hab junihim g s‑apꞌekam k ab wo t‑mah g has elidadag ch s‑ap tahhadkam. Ahchim Tutuligo att wehpeg bei ihda s‑apꞌekam. Mt wabshaba ahpim gawul mahs hemajkam ab hahawa bei.
<sax> God has no favorites. ||| Jiosh o wehs t‑wepo ab t‑neid ch wehs t‑wepo s‑t‑doꞌibiamk.
<sax> Those who sin even though they don't have the written law are still lost, while those who sin that do have the written law will be condemned by that law. ||| Gawul mahs hemajkam o pi hekaj g Moses chehanig ch wabshaba s‑mahch mo haschu d s‑apꞌekam ch wo e lodai heg hekaj mo pi hab junihim g s‑apꞌekam.

<sax> You're absolutely sure that you can guide the blind, and that you are a light to those in the dark. ||| Bo e elid mo d ha wanimeddam ch ab ha mahkch g tonlig hegam mo pi edgid g Jiosh chehanig.
<sax> You think you can set ignorant people straight, a teacher of “children,” because you know from the law all the truth there is to know. ||| Bo e elid mo wehs ab uꞌukch g amichudadag ch wohokam no pi ab uꞌukch hegai chehanig. Chum o wa ha mashcham g pi haꞌichu mahchim ch aꞌal
<sax> So if you're busy teaching others, why don't you teach yourself? You tell people not to steal, but are you stealing? ||| k ch eda pi hejel am hu hab wua g e‑mashchama. Haꞌijj o ha mihshmad mat pi hedai haꞌichu wo ha ehsidad
<sax> You tell people not to commit adultery, but are you committing adultery? You tell people not to worship idols, but do you profane temples? ||| ch pi wo ha wehm woꞌiwua hegai mo pi d ha‑wehm kihhim ch eda hejel hab masma hab e wua. Si o pi hohhoꞌid mat ab wo ihmad g hemajkam nahtoi k ch eda wo ha ehs mo haschu an hab chuꞌig ha‑cheopi ed.

<sax> As Scripture says, “God's character is defamed among the foreigners because of you.” ||| An o hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed:
<sax> Being circumcised  has value only if you do what the law says. But if you break the law, your circumcision is as worthless as those who are not circumcised at all. ||| Do si haꞌichu g pahl hikuchka em‑wehhejed mamtp ab wo wohog elidad g chehanig. Mtp wabshaba pi ab hu wo wohog elidad, k pi has d shaꞌi ahga g pahl hikuchka.
<sax> If a man who is not circumcised keeps the law, he should be considered as being circumcised even though he's not. ||| Matp hema ab wo sha wohog elidad g Jiosh chehanig, t g Jiosh hab masma ab wo neidad mo pahl hikuchkas, chum as pi d Tuhligo ch pi woho hikuchkas.
<sax> What makes you a Jew is on the inside, a “circumcision of the heart” that doesn't follow the letter of the law but the Spirit. Someone like that is looking for praise from God, not from people. ||| Hegam o hi d Jiosh hemajkamga mat gawul juh g e‑ihbdag. Kut pi wo e nako mas g chehanigkaj hab wo juh ihda. Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag at hemho wo wa gawul juh g t‑ihbdag. Tp hems ab wo em‑hehgchul g hemajkam mamt gawul wo juh g e‑chuhkug. T wabshaba g Jiosh ab wo em‑hehgchul mat gawul wo e juh g em‑ihbdag.
<sax> So does a Jew have any advantage? Does circumcision have any benefits? ||| Pegih, mtp hems a haꞌijj hab wo chei, “Pi oki haꞌichu d shaꞌi ha‑apꞌedag g Tutuligo ha dahm g gawul mahs hemajkam.”
<sax> Yes, there are many benefits! First of all, God's message was entrusted to them. ||| Nt wabshaba wo em‑ahgi mo muꞌi haꞌichu d t‑apꞌedag. Hema o d ihda mat g Jiosh ab t‑hiwigi g haꞌichu e‑ahga matt wo ha ahgi g nahnko mahs hemajkam.
<sax> What if some of them didn't trust in God? Does their lack of trust in God obliterate the trustworthiness of God? ||| K hi wa chum woho mo haꞌijj g ni‑wehm oꞌodham pi ab hu wohog elid g haꞌichu ahgaj. T wabshaba g Jiosh woho am hab wo juh hegai mo has i kaij.
<sax> Of course not! Even if everyone else is proved to be lying, God always tells the truth. As Scripture says, “What you say will be proved right, and you will win your case  when you are judged.” ||| Chum o hekid ahg g wohokam, chum as wehs hemajkam g iattogi hab wua. Neh, bo chuꞌig an Jiosh oꞌohana ed:
<sax> But if the fact that we're wrong helps to show that God is right, what should we conclude? That God is wrong to pronounce judgment on us? (I'm talking from a human perspective here). ||| Haꞌijj o hab kaij, M o wa s‑apꞌe matt hab wo junihid g pi apꞌekam no pi heg hekaj tasho am chehgid mo g Jiosh hab wua g s‑apꞌekam. T heg hekaj pi ap hab wo e juh g Jiosh matp s‑koꞌokam wo t‑namkid heg hekaj. Neh, bo kaij.
<sax> Of course not! How else could God judge the world? ||| Nt wabshaba wo em‑ahgi mo ahg g iattogi. Jiosh o chum hekid hab wua g s‑apꞌekam. Pi at has masma wo e nako mat wo t‑lodai matp d wo pi apꞌekamk.
<sax> Someone could say, “Why am I still condemned as a sinner if my lies make the truth of God and his glory more obvious in contrast?” ||| K hab kaij idam, T‑iattogi o am tashogid mo g Jiosh chum hekid ahg wohokam.

<sax> As Scripture says, “No one does what is right, not even one. ||| An o hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed:
<sax> It's clear that everything in the law applies to those who live under the law so that no one could have any excuses, and to make sure everyone in the whole world is answerable to God. ||| Jiosh at ab baꞌich wo i ha chuꞌijigch hegam mo edgid g chehanigaj ch pi am hu heg oidch hab e junihim. K hekaj hab mahs mo g Jiosh wehs ab ha abchud g hemajkam.
<sax> For no one is made right before God by doing what the law requires. The law only helps us recognize what sin really is. ||| Pi at hedai wo e nako mas wehs am hab wo junihid g Jiosh chehanig ch hekaj wo i e apꞌech am Jiosh tahgio. Chehanigaj at am wo i t‑tashogi mach haschu pi apꞌekam hab wua.
<sax> But now God's character of goodness and right  has been demonstrated. It has nothing to do with law-keeping, even though it was spoken of by the law and the prophets. ||| Iaꞌi idani at am i tashogi g Jiosh mat has masma wo i ha apꞌech g hemajkam am e tahgio. Chehanig at pi wo shaꞌi t‑apꞌechud k wabshaba heg wohokamchud mat has masma g Jiosh wo i t‑apꞌech. K g kekelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam id hab waꞌap wohokamchud.
<sax> This right character of God comes to everyone who trusts in Jesus Christ, those who place their confidence in him. It doesn't matter who we are: ||| Jiosh at am wo i ha apꞌech hegam matp hedai ab wo i s‑wohoch g haꞌichu ahgaj k ab wo hiwgad g Jesus Christ, chum as has mahs d wo hemajkamk.
<sax> We have all sinned, and we fall far short of God's glorious ideal. ||| Wehs hemajkam at hab juh g pi apꞌekam k pi am hu ais g Jiosh hab elida.
<sax> Yet through the free gift of his grace God makes us right through Christ Jesus who sets us free. ||| K wabshaba g Jiosh ab i s‑t‑hoꞌigeꞌid. T g alidaj Jesus Christ ab moht g s‑koꞌok t‑namkidadag am t‑wehhejed. T hekaj ab i t‑apꞌech g Jiosh e wui.
<sax> God openly presented Jesus as the gift that brings peace to those trusting in him, the one who shed his blood. God did this to demonstrate he is truly right, for previously he would hold back and pass over sins, ||| Jiosh at am i apꞌech mat g alidaj wo e muhkid am t‑wehhejed k hekaj gam hu hab wo i juh g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig mattp hedai ab wo i s‑wohoch. Ab o wabsh s‑ha hoꞌigeꞌid hegam heki hu hemajkam mo ab s‑wohochud ch pi chegima g ha‑chuꞌijig
<sax> Is God only the God of the Jews? Isn't he the God of other people as well? Of course he is! ||| Pi o hegam d waꞌi ha‑Jioshga mat ab ha mah g chehanig ch wabshaba wehs hemajkam d ha‑Jioshga.
<sax> There is only one God, and he makes us right through our trust in him, whoever we are, Jew or foreigner. ||| Ab o ha wehnad ch wepo masma ab ha neid g Tutuligo ch hegam mo pi d Tutuligo. Wehsijj at hab waꞌi masma wo i e apꞌech am Jiosh tahgio mat ab wo i s‑wohoch g haꞌichu ahgaj ab amjed g Jesus.
<sax> Does that mean that by trusting in God we do away with the law? Of course not! In fact we affirm the importance of the law. ||| Id o pi hab d ahga machs im hu hab i juh g Jiosh chehanig matt hekid ab i s‑wohoch. T‑wohochudadag o am i t‑gewpkad matt am hab wo junihid g tatchuij mo hab wa chum d ahga g chehanigaj.
<sax> Let's take Abraham as an example. From a human viewpoint he is the father of our nation. Let's ask, “What was his experience?” ||| Am ant wo i wuhshad g Abrahambad mant am wo i em‑tashogi ihda mani wa em‑ahgid. Ihda Abrahambad ash d t‑shohshon ahchim Tutuligo
<sax> For if Abraham was set right by what he did, he would have had something to boast about—but not in God's eyes. ||| ch ab i s‑wohoch g Jiosh. Tsh g Jiosh heg hekaj am i apꞌech e tahgio. Pi atsh wa hejel am i e apꞌech heg hekaj mas hab junihim g s‑apꞌekam. K heg hekaj wa pi am hu haꞌichu d shaꞌi hegai matsh wa heg hekaj wo chum si e haschudad g Abrahambad.
<sax> However what does Scripture say? “Abraham trusted God, and so he was considered as being right.” ||| An o hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed:
<sax> Now is this blessing just for the Jews, or is it for others too? We've just stated that Abraham was accepted as right because he trusted God. ||| David o pi hegam hab waꞌi ha ahg mo pahl hikuchkas ch wabshaba hegam hab ep ha ahg mo pi pahl hikuchkas. Heki ani hu ahg matsh g Abrahambad ab i s‑wohoch g Jiosh. Sh g Jiosh heg hekaj hab kaij mo d s‑apꞌekam.
<sax> But when did this happen? When Abraham was a Jew or before? ||| Id at hab e juh mat koi e pahl hikuch g Abrahambad.
<sax> For if the promised inheritance is based on keeping the law, then the issue of trusting God is not necessary, and the promise is pointless. ||| Kut pi haꞌichu wehhejed wo s‑kehgajk g ha‑wohochudadag matp id hab wo sha ha juni g Jiosh hegam mo pi ab hu wohochud ch am hab wabsh junihim hegai mo an oꞌohanas chehanig ed. T g Jiosh d wo s‑iattomkamk matp am hab wo sha ha juni.
<sax> For the law results in punishment but if there's no law then it cannot be broken. ||| Pi att ab hu wo shaꞌi i t‑apꞌech g chehanigkaj k wabshaba heg hekaj ab wo t‑abch g t‑chuꞌijig matt ab wo bei g s‑koꞌok t‑namkidadag. T hegam mo pi edgid pi heg hekaj ab hu wo e abch.
<sax> So the promise is based on trusting God. It is provided as a free gift, guaranteed to all the children of Abraham—not merely to those who follow the law,  but also to those who trust like Abraham, the father of us all. ||| Pi at ahchim am waꞌi i t‑apꞌech g Jiosh mach wa an uꞌukch g heki hu chehanigaj. Ahpim at am ep i em‑apꞌech mamt hab waꞌap ab i s‑wohoch g haꞌichu ahgaj. Batt masma am oidk hab t‑juh g Abrahambad k ab hiwig g Jiosh hemajimatalig. Id o heg wa wepo mo g Abrahambad d t‑ohg. K g Jiosh heg hekaj am t‑chehgidch mat has wo chum masmak.
<sax> As Scripture says, “I've made you the father of many nations.” For in the presence of God, Abraham trusted in the God who makes the dead alive and speaks into existence what didn't previously exist. ||| Bo masma an oꞌohadag mash g Jiosh am ahgid g Abrahambad:
<sax> Now that we have been made right by God by trusting in him, we have peace with him through our Lord Jesus Christ. ||| Am at i t‑apꞌech g Jiosh e tahgio ahchim matt ab i s‑wohoch g haꞌichu ahgaj ab amjed g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ. Kuch heg hekaj ab wui si s‑ap t‑tahtk.
<sax> It's through Jesus, trusting in him, that we've gained access to this position of grace where we now stand, looking forward with happiness and confidence to sharing in God's glory. ||| Shoꞌo waꞌi si s‑hemajima a t‑wui. Kuch si s‑hehgig ch ab nenida mat ab wo i t‑wahpki e‑kihdag ed k ab wo si t‑haꞌichuch.
<sax> Not only this—we also remain confident when problems come, because we know that experiencing problems develops spiritual stamina. ||| Chum as haꞌichu t‑kudut, ch eda si s‑hehgig nach pi s‑mahch mo g t‑kudutadag hab t‑wua matt wo s‑chu nakogad.
<sax> Spiritual stamina in turn develops a mature character, and this mature character results in confident hope. ||| T g Jiosh s‑ap wo i t‑el mach s‑chu nakog. Kutt id hekaj am wo i t‑gewpkai heg wui mach ab nenida.
<sax> Who would die for anybody else, even someone who does what's right? (Though perhaps somebody would be brave enough to die for someone really good.) ||| Pi o hedai e muhkidamk hema wehhejed. Tp hems hema hi wo wa e muhkid hema wehhejed mo d si oꞌodham.
<sax> But God demonstrates his love for us in that Christ died for us while we were still sinners. ||| Kuch eda d wa chum pi ap chuꞌijkam. T g Jiosh am t‑chehgi mo heꞌes ab si i t‑tatchua am i apꞌechudk mat g alidaj am t‑wehhejed muh k gam hu hab i juh g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig.
<sax> Now that we are made right by his death, we can be absolutely sure we'll be saved by him from the coming judgment. ||| Kuch hab s‑mahch mat hahawa pi heg hekaj ab hu wo t‑namkid.
<sax> While we were his enemies, God made us his friends through the death of his Son, and so we can be absolutely sure that he will save us through the life of his Son. ||| Heki ach hu pi ab hu hajunima g Jiosh. T g alidaj muh am t‑wehhejed mat hab wo t‑juh matt ab haha wo hajunit g Jiosh. Pegih, ch baꞌich ab i apꞌedag am Christ doꞌibiatalig ed no pi d doakam ab muhkig amjed ch wo e nako mat wo i t‑wehmtad.
<sax> In addition to this we now celebrate what God has done through our Lord Jesus Christ to reconcile us and make us his friends. ||| Kuch si s‑hehgig mat g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ gam hu hab i juh g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig k am i t‑apꞌech mach ab hahawa si s‑hajunima g Jiosh.
<sax> For through one man sin entered the world, and sin led to death. In this way death came to everyone, for everyone sinned.  Even before the law was given, sin was in the world, however it wasn't counted as sin because there was no law.  But death still ruled from Adam until Moses, even over those who didn't sin in the same way as Adam did. ||| Ab atsh haꞌichu cheha g Jiosh hegai mo d wehpeg oꞌodham ch hab chehgig Adam. Tsh heg mulin k hab i shonwuich g pi apꞌekam jewed dahm. Tsh hekaj am i shonwua muhkig. Tsh g Jiosh pi hab ep juh g chehanig am hugkam matsh an i wuhsh g Mosesbad. Sh eda wehsijj hab wua g pi apꞌekam. Kush heg hekaj g muhkig wehsijj ab ha aꞌahe, chum as pi mulin g chehanig hab masma matsh wa g Adambad.
<sax> But the gift of Jesus is not like the sin of Adam. Though many people died because of one man's sin, God's grace is so much greater and has been shared with so many through his gracious gift in the person of Jesus Christ. ||| Wehsijj atsh ab haꞌichu i wahpki am wehs ha wehhejed g hemajkam. K wabshaba gawul mams hegai mat ab i wahpki. Do muhkig hegai matsh g Adambad ab i wahki wehs ha wehhejed g hemajkam. K wabshaba d Jiosh hemajimatalig hegai matsh g Jesus Christ ab i wahki wehs t‑wehhejed.
<sax> The result of the gift is not like that of the sin. The result of Adam's sin was judgment and condemnation, but the gift sets us right with God, despite our many sins. ||| K d al hemako hegai chuꞌijig mat hekaj am i wah g s‑koꞌok namkidadag. K wabshaba muꞌij g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig. K eda g Jiosh wehs gam hu hab i junihog am t‑wehhejed. Ab o d t‑wuikam hegai s‑koꞌok namkidadag nach pi ab d Adambad amjedkam. K wabshaba d Jiosh mahkig ihda mat hab t‑juni gm hu hab i juhk g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig.
<sax> Just as through one man's disobedience many became sinners, in the same way through one man's obedience many are made right with God. ||| Adambad at pi wohog el g Jiosh. K heg hekaj muꞌijj d pi ap chuꞌijkam. Christ at hejel ab s‑wohog el g Jiosh. Kut heg hekaj muꞌijj ab wo i e apꞌech am Jiosh tahgio.
<sax> When the law was introduced, sin became even more obvious. But while sin became much more obvious, grace became even more obvious! ||| Hemajkam o pi hohhoꞌid g chehanig ch baꞌich hab i s‑junimk g pi apꞌekam wa chum s‑mahchch g chehanig. K wabshaba ab t‑mahks matt hekaj wo s‑mahchk mo heꞌes i geꞌej g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig. K eda g Jiosh hoꞌigeꞌidadag baꞌich i geꞌej no pi gam hu hab i junihog g t‑chuꞌijig.
<sax> Just as sin ruled us and brought us death, now grace rules by making us right with God, bringing us eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. ||| Pegih, tt wo chum nei mat am t‑gewito g pi apꞌekam nach pi heg hekaj ab aihim g muhkig. Heg o wa wepo mo d t‑maliomig g pi apꞌekam ch am t‑wanchshulig muhkig wui. Kuch wabshaba hemuch edgid g Jiosh hemajimatalig ab i s‑wohochudk g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj ab amjed g t‑kownalig Jesus Christ.
<sax> So what's our response? Should we continue to sin so we can have even more grace? ||| Pegih, tp hems haꞌi hab wo chei matt hig baꞌich am hab wo i junihid g pi apꞌekam. T g Jiosh baꞌich wo i s‑t‑hoꞌigeꞌel.
<sax> Of course not! Since we're already dead to sin, how can we continue to live in sin? ||| K eda pi hab shaꞌi chum mahs machs am hab wo junihid g pi apꞌekam. Am att i dagito g pi apꞌekam. K pi am hu hahawa ha gewkdag t‑dahm. Id o heg wa wepo matt heki hu muh natt pi pi hab hahawa ep wo junihid g pi apꞌekam.
<sax> Don't you know that all of us who were baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? ||| Ab att t‑chehgi g t‑pahl wakonakaj matt ab i t‑hemakoj Jesus Christ wehm. K heg wa wepo matt am wehmaj muh natt pi ab i t‑hemakoj heg wehm mat muh.
<sax> Through baptism we were buried with him in death so that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father we too can live a new life. ||| T‑pahl wakona o wepogidas matt wehmaj ged hu t‑hiash am i muhk. T g Jiosh ab i t‑mah g wechij doakag heg hekaj si geꞌe e‑gewkdag mat hekaj ab i wamigi g Christ muhkig amjed.
<sax> If we've become one with him in dying like he did, then we'll be raised like him too. ||| Ab att i t‑hemakoj heg wehm mat am t‑wehhejed muh. Kut hekaj ab t‑mah g wechij doakag. Id o wepo masma matt am wehmaj koꞌo k wehmaj ep t‑chechegito.
<sax> Since we died with Christ, we have confidence that we will also live with him, ||| Heg muhkig o d t‑muhkig no pi d t‑namkidadag. Id att ab i s‑wohoch. T g Jiosh heg hekaj ab t‑mah g wechij doakag k ab wo i t‑wuwhas muhkig amjed hab masma mat hab juh g Christ.
<sax> for we know that because Christ has been raised from the dead he won't ever die, because death has no longer any power over him. ||| Pi at hekid ep wo muh g Christ mat wa uhpam ep e chegito. Muhkig o pi am hu dahm gewkdag.
<sax> In dying, he died to sin once and for all, but now he lives, and he lives for God! ||| Hemho at muh mat wo kuhgi g pi apꞌekam gewkdag am t‑dodakag ed k ep e chegito k hemuch d doakam wehhejed g Jiosh.
<sax> In just the same way you should consider yourselves dead to sin, but alive to God through Christ Jesus. ||| Pegih, mt wo chum kuhgi g pi apꞌekam e‑dodakag ed k d wo dodakamk wehhejed g Jiosh ab i e hemakochudk g Jesus Christ wehm.
<sax> Don't let sin have control over your mortal body, don't give in to its temptations, ||| Pi g wo hiwgidad g pi apꞌekam mas am ep wo i chikp g em‑doakag mamt hekaj hab wo juh g pi ap e‑tatchui.
<sax> and don't use any parts of your body as evil tools of sin. Instead dedicate yourselves to God as those who have been brought back from death to life, and use all parts of your body as tools to do something good for God. ||| Wehs amt am wo i e‑dagito Jiosh wui namsh pi d e doꞌibiakam ab amjed g muhkig. T am haha wo i em‑hekaj g Jiosh mamt am hab wo junihid g s‑apꞌekam. Pi g wo shaꞌi e hiwgid mas wo em‑hekaj g pi apꞌekam has i masma.
<sax> Sin won't rule over you, because you're not under law but under grace. ||| Heki ach hu ab wecho g chehanig ch wabshaba hemuch edgid g Jiosh hemajimatalig ch hab pi hab wo chum junihid g pi apꞌekam.
<sax> So then, should we sin because we're not under law, but under grace? Of course not! ||| Pegih, t hahawa pi ab hu haꞌichu wo t‑abch g chehanig nat pi g Jiosh ab s‑t‑hoꞌigeꞌid k t‑doꞌibia. Kutp hems heg hekaj haꞌi hab wo elidad mat am hab wabsh wo i junihid g pi apꞌekam.
<sax> Now that you've been freed from sin, you've become slaves of doing right. ||| E amt wulꞌo ab amjed g pi apꞌekam. K g s‑apꞌekam an hahawa em‑uꞌukch.
<sax> I'm using this everyday example because your human thinking is limited. Just as you once enslaved yourselves to immorality, piling up sin upon sin, now you must enslave yourselves to what is pure and right. ||| Ni wabsh g pi hasig neꞌokikaj em‑tashogid nam pi pi koi si s‑amichud. Am amki wa e dagitokch si s‑uam haꞌichu wui ch hab junihim g pi apꞌekam. Tsh g Jiosh em‑doꞌibia. Kumt am hahawa wehs wo i e dagito s‑apꞌekam wui ch hab wo junihid g Jiosh tatchui.
<sax> When you were slaves to sin you were not required to do what's right. ||| Pi am ab hu kaiham g s‑apꞌekam mo hekid g pi apꞌekam an em‑uꞌukch.
<sax> But what were the results back then? Aren't you ashamed of the things you did? Such things that lead to death! ||| Kut pi haꞌichu s‑ap hab em‑juni g pi apꞌekam. Si am wa e ehꞌelid mam wa am hab junihim. K g pi apꞌekam ab wabsh em‑ahijidahim g s‑koꞌok em‑namkidadag.
<sax> But now that you're set free from sin, and have become God's slaves, the results will be a pure life—and in the end, eternal life. ||| Kumt wabshaba e wulꞌo ab amjed g pi apꞌekam. K g Jiosh d hahawa em‑ahmo ch hab em‑juh mam d hahawa s‑apꞌekam. K ab him mamt ab wehs wo bei g pi ha huhugedam doakag.
<sax> The wage sin pays is death, but God's free gift is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord. ||| Hegam mat hab wo junihid g pi apꞌekam at ab wo ai g s‑koꞌok e‑namkidadag. T wabshaba hegam mat ab wo i e dagito t‑kownalig Jesus Christ wui ab wo bei g pi ha huhugedam doakag.
<sax> Brothers and sisters, (I'm speaking here to people who know the law), don't you see that the law has authority over someone only while they're alive? ||| Neh, ni‑wepnag, s‑mahch amki mo has chuꞌig g t‑chehanig. Kuni heg hekaj hab em‑elid mamt wo s‑amich ihda mant wo em‑ahgi. Chehanig o an uꞌukch g oꞌodham am hugkam mat heꞌes i tash d wo doakamk.
<sax> For example, a married woman is bound by the law to her husband while he's alive, but if he dies, she's released from this legal obligation to him.  So if she lives with another man while her husband is alive, she would be committing adultery. However, if her husband dies and then she marries another man, she wouldn't be guilty of adultery. ||| Pegih, k hab chuꞌig g chehanig mat g uwi pi ep wo ha kunt mat eda g kunaj d wabsh wo kia doakamk. K wabshaba hiwgidas mat wo ha kunt matp g kunaj heki hu wo muh. Pi o ab hu hahawa shohbidch g chehanig.
<sax> But now we've been set free from the law, and have died to what kept us in chains, so that we can serve in the newness of the spirit and not the old letter of the law. ||| Tt wabshaba ab i t‑hemakoj g Christ wehm. T g Jiosh t‑wulꞌo ab amjed g chehanig. Heki ach hu am chum chikpanid g Jiosh g chehanigkaj. K wabshaba hemu g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag t‑wanimed. Ch hahawa woho chikpanid.
<sax> So what do we conclude? That the law is sin? Of course not! I wouldn't have known what sin was unless the law defined it. I wouldn't have realized that wanting to have other people's things for myself was wrong without the law that says, “Don't desire for yourself what belongs to someone else.” ||| Haꞌi o hab elid mo pi apꞌe g Jiosh chehanig. K wabshaba pi woho. Chehanig o am t‑tashogid g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig. Neh, pi att wo chum mahchk mo pi apꞌe mach si pihk t‑elid g haꞌichu t‑enigakaj. K wabshaba g chehanig am t‑tashogid mo pi apꞌe.
<sax> But through this commandment sin found a way to stir up in me all kinds of selfish desires—for without law, sin is dead. ||| Kuch wa am hahawa baꞌich i s‑gewkam si pihk t‑elid g haꞌichu t‑enigakaj. Matp pi an hu wo haꞌichugk g chehanig, t d wabsh wo pi haꞌichuk g pi apꞌekam.
<sax> I used to live without realizing what the law really meant, but when I understood the implications of that commandment, then sin came back to life, and I died. ||| Neh, pi ani has shaꞌi ni‑tahtk mani eda pi ap mahch g chehanig. Nt hahawa s‑mai. T baꞌich am i si e chehgi g pi apꞌekam am ni‑eda. Kunt s‑mai maniki aihog g s‑koꞌok ni‑namkidadag.
<sax> I discovered that the very commandment that was meant to bring life brought death instead,  because sin found a way through the commandment to deceive me, and used the commandment to kill me! ||| Jiosh at hab juh g e‑chehanig matt heg hekaj wo s‑mai matt has masma wo bei g s‑ap doakag. Kunid eda heg ab am cheh maniki d pi ap chuꞌijkam ch ab aihog g ni‑muhkig ch s‑koꞌok ni‑namkidadag.
<sax> However, the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, right, and good. ||| Do hekia s‑apꞌekam ch s‑kehgaj g chehanig ch am t‑tashogid matt has wo chum t‑junihid.
<sax> Now would something that is good kill me? Of course not! But sin shows itself to be sin by using good to cause my death. So by means of the commandment, it's revealed how evil sin really is. ||| Pi at g chehanig hab ni‑juh mani ab aihog g ni‑muhkig ch s‑koꞌok ni‑namkidadag. Pi apꞌekam at hab ni‑juh mani wa ab aihog. Chehanig o s‑kehgaj. K g Jiosh heg hekaj am t‑tashogid mo haschu d pi apꞌekam ch has masma si pi apꞌe.
<sax> We realize that the law is spiritual; but I'm all-too-human, a slave to sin. ||| Pegih, k d hekia s‑apꞌekam g chehanig. Kuni wa wabshaba d wabsh oꞌodham. K wa g pi apꞌekam an ni‑uꞌukch.
<sax> So it's no longer me who does this, but sin living in me— ||| Pi ani wa hab chum junimk g pi apꞌekam. K wa wabshaba heg an ni‑uꞌukch. K wa heg hekaj heg wa wepo mani wa pi d si ahni ch am hab junihim.
<sax> for I know that there's nothing good in me as far as my sinful human nature is concerned. Even though I want to do good, I'm just not able to do it. ||| Ni‑doakag o wa d wabsh hekia pi apꞌekam mani wa eda pi ab hu hiwig g Jiosh. Kuni wa pi shaꞌi ni‑nakog manis am hab wo junihid g s‑apꞌekam, chum anis wa hab s‑junimk.
<sax> The good I want to do, I don't do; while the evil I don't want to do, that's what I end up doing! ||| Heg ani hab waꞌi junihim pi apꞌekam, chum anis pi hab chum junimk.
<sax> However if I'm doing what I don't want to, then it's no longer me doing it, but sin living in me. ||| Heg ani wa hekaj hab kaij mani pi d si ahni ch hab junihim. Pi apꞌekam o wa an ni‑uꞌukch.
<sax> This is the principle I've discovered: if I want to do what's good, evil is always there too. ||| Pegih, boki chuꞌig g t‑doakag mach eda pi ab hu hiwig g Jiosh. Pi att wo t‑nako machs hejel am hab wo junihid g s‑apꞌekam, chum achs hab s‑junimk.
<sax> My inner self is delighted with God's law, ||| S‑mahch ach mo s‑apꞌe g Jiosh chehanig.
<sax> but I see a different law at work within me that is at war with the law my mind has decided to follow, making me a prisoner of the law of sin that is within me. ||| K wabshaba g pi apꞌekam an t‑uꞌukch ch hab t‑wua mach ab wui gegok.
<sax> I'm totally miserable! Who will rescue me from this body that's causing my death? Thank God—for he does this through Jesus Christ our Lord!  Here's the situation: while I myself choose with my mind to obey God's law, my human nature obeys the law of sin. ||| Pegih, boki chuꞌig g t‑doakag mach eda pi ab hu hiwig g Jiosh. Bach chum s‑junimk g Jiosh chehanig ch wabshaba am hab wabsh junihim g pi apꞌekam. K pi in hu hedai haꞌichug mas wo t‑doꞌibia. Kuch heg hekaj si pi ap t‑tahtk. T wabshaba g Jiosh am i kei g e‑alidag Jesus Christ. Kut heg t‑doꞌibia. Id ach hekaj ab si hoꞌigeꞌid g Jiosh.
<sax> What the law couldn't do because it was powerless due to our sinful nature,  God was able to do! By sending his own Son in human form, God dealt with the whole problem of sin and destroyed sin's power in our sinful human nature. ||| Pi att wo shaꞌi t‑nako machs am hu hab wo junihid g chehanig ch hekaj wo t‑doꞌibia nach pi d wabsh oꞌodham. T wabshaba g Jiosh am i kei g e‑alidag mat wo t‑doꞌibia. T heg ia i wuhsh jewed dahm k hab masmakahim mach ahchim ch wabshaba pi ha chuꞌijig ch gam hu hab i juh g pi ap t‑chuꞌijig.
<sax> In this way we could fulfill the good requirements of the law by following the Spirit and not our sinful nature. ||| Jiosh at hab masma am i t‑apꞌech e‑tahgio k hab masma ab t‑neid matt pi hekid shaꞌi mul g chehanig ahchim mach ab i t‑dagitokch Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag wui ch pi am hu hab junihim g hejel pi ap t‑tatchui.
<sax> Those who follow their sinful nature are preoccupied with sinful things, but those who follow the Spirit concentrate on spiritual things. ||| Hegam mo hab junihim g hejel e‑tatchui o heg hekaj an e uꞌukch. K hegam mo hab junihim g tatchuij g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag heg hekaj an epai e uꞌukch.
<sax> The sinful human mind results in death, but having the mind led by the Spirit results in life and peace. ||| Am o hihim s‑koꞌok e‑namkidadag wui hegam mo hab junihim g hejel e‑tatchui. Ch ahchim mach hab junihim g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag tatchui am Jiosh kihdag wui hihimad ch hekaj wo si s‑ap t‑tahtkkad.
<sax> The sinful human mind is hostile to God because it refuses to obey the law of God—in fact it never can, ||| Do obgaj g Jiosh hegai mo hedai g hejel e‑tatchui hab junihim no pi pi ab hu wohog elid g Jiosh ch pi wo shaꞌi e nako mas am hab wo e juh.
<sax> and those who follow their sinful nature can never please God. ||| Pi at wo e nako hegam mo hab wua g hejel e‑tatchui mas hab wo juh g Jiosh tatchui.
<sax> But you're not following your sinful nature, but the Spirit—if it's true that the Spirit of God is living in you. For those that don't have the Spirit of Christ in them don't belong to him. ||| Ch wabshaba ahchim pi g hejel t‑tatchui hab wua. Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag o am t‑eda hab chuꞌig. Kuch heg tatchui hab wua. Hegam mo pi am hu ha eda g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag o pi d Jiosh hemajkamga.
<sax> However if Christ is in you, even though your body is going to die because of sin, the Spirit gives you life because you're now right with God. ||| T ahchim am i t‑apꞌech g Christ am tahgio g Jiosh k ab t‑mah g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. Kuch heg hekaj edgid g wechig doakag, chum as hi wa g muhkig ab wehs ha aihog g hemajkam g pi ap ha‑chuꞌijigkaj.
<sax> For if you live under the control of your sinful nature, you're going to die. But if you follow the way of the Spirit, putting to death the evil things you do, then you will live. ||| Jiosh at gam hu hab wo i t‑juh mattp am hab wo sha junihid g hejel t‑tatchui. Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag o am i em‑wehmaj. Kumt gam hu wo s‑ohhod g pi ap haꞌichu hab e‑juni k hab wo edgidad g wechij doakag.
<sax> All those who are led by the Spirit of God are God's children. ||| Ab at t‑mah g Jiosh g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. K heg am t‑wanimed. Ch hab s‑mahch mach d Jiosh aꞌaliga
<sax> You were not given a spirit to enslave and terrify you once more. No, what you received was the spirit that makes you children in God's family. Now we can shout out, “God is our Father!” ||| ch ab ihm mo d t‑ohg ch pi shaꞌi ehbid.
<sax> The Spirit himself agrees with us that we're God's children. ||| Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag o am t‑tashogid mach d aꞌaligaj g Jiosh.
<sax> If we're his children, then we're his heirs. We are heirs of God, and heirs together with Christ. But if we want to share in his glory we must share in his sufferings. ||| Jiosh at ab wehs mah g e‑alidag g e‑hoꞌigeꞌidalig k hab waꞌap wo t‑mah nach pi hab waꞌap d aꞌaligaj. Kutt wabshaba wehpeg ab wo nako g shoꞌigdag hab masma mat heg hab e juh mo d si alidaj.
<sax> Yet I'm convinced that what we suffer in the present is nothing compared to the future glory that will be revealed to us. ||| Si atsh geꞌe ab wo has t‑elidad g Jiosh. Kutt hab pi wo shaꞌi kuint g al t‑shoꞌigdag ia jewed dahm.
<sax> All of creation is patiently waiting, longing for God to reveal his children. ||| Jiosh atsh wehs haꞌichu dahm wo t‑mahsko wua ahchim aꞌaligaj. K wehs haꞌichu nahtoij heg nenida.
<sax> For God allowed the purpose of creation to be frustrated.  But creation itself waits in hope for the time when it will be set free from the slavery of decay and share the glorious freedom of God's children. ||| Do Jiosh hab elida mat wehs e padch g nahtoij mat eda g oꞌodham pi ap chuꞌi. Wehs haꞌichu o ab hahawa e wulshch g pi apꞌekamkaj. Tsh wabshaba g Jiosh wo wulꞌo g e‑nahtoi mat hekid am wo mahsko t‑wua ahchim aꞌaligaj. Tsh wehs haꞌichu hahawa ep si s‑kehg hab wo mahsk.
<sax> For we were saved by hope. Yet hope that's already seen isn't hope at all. Who hopes for what they can already see? ||| Ab att i s‑wohoch g Jiosh. Kut t‑doꞌibia. K wabshaba am wabsh kia wiꞌis mat wo nahto g t‑doꞌibiadag k am wo i t‑wahpki e‑kihdag ed. Kuch s‑wohochud mat id hab wo t‑juni.
<sax> Since we're hoping for what we haven't yet seen, we wait for it patiently. ||| Wohochudadag o hab d ahga mamt s‑e tahtk ch ab wo nenidad hegai mamt koi nei.
<sax> Similarly the Spirit helps us in our weakness. We don't know how to speak with God, but the Spirit himself intercedes with and through us by groans that can't be put into words. ||| Pi ach ahim gewkdag. K wabshaba g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag i t‑wehmaj. Pi ach mahch matt has masma wo t‑hoꞌigeꞌidahunad am Jiosh wui. K wabshaba g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ab t‑mahtchulid. Kuch hab shahshani ch shoak am Jiosh wui ch pi shaꞌi mahch matt has masma hab wo chei hegai mo haschu ab t‑tahtchud.
<sax> The One who examines the minds of everyone knows the Spirit's motives, because the Spirit pleads God's cause on behalf of the believers. ||| K wabshaba g Jiosh s‑mahch g t‑ihbdag ch ep s‑mahch hegai mo haschu ab t‑tahtchud g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. Heg o hab wua g t‑hoꞌigeꞌidahuna am Jiosh tatchui oidch. Kuch ab tahni g i wehmtadag am ha wehhejed g Jiosh hemajkamga.
<sax> We know that in all things God works for the good of those who love him, those who he has called to be part of his plan. ||| Ab at i t‑wai g Jiosh matt d wo hemajkamgajk. Kuch ab wui si pihk t‑elid. K g Jiosh heg hekaj wehs haꞌichu am i apꞌechud mat t‑wehhejed wo s‑ap i wuhsh haꞌichu.
<sax> For God, choosing them in advance, set them apart to be like his Son, so that the Son would be the first of many brothers and sisters. ||| Heki o hu s‑mahch g Jiosh mat hedai ab wo kaiha g waidaj ch am apꞌech matt wo wepo chuꞌigk g alidaj ch wehmaj d wo aꞌaligajk. T g alidaj d wo wehpeg t‑siꞌihegk.
<sax> Those that he chose, he also called; and those that he called, he also made right; and those that he made right, he also glorified. ||| T wa woho ab i t‑waid k am i t‑apꞌech e tahgio k hahawa pi ab hu haꞌichu t‑chuꞌijigchud. K am baꞌich ehp mat ab t‑mah g si has e‑elidadag.
<sax> So what's our response to all this? If God is for us, who can be against us? ||| Pegih, bo masma am t‑wehhejed kehk g Jiosh. T hab pi hedai wo e nako mas ab t‑wui wo kekiwua.
<sax> so who can condemn us? It's Christ Jesus who died—more importantly, who was raised from the dead—who stands at God's right-hand, presenting our case. ||| Jiosh alidag at ab nako g s‑koꞌok t‑namkidadag am t‑wehhejed muhk. T hab pi wo t‑ai hegai t‑namkidadag. T g Jiosh ab i wuhshad muhkig amjed k an s‑apko dai e‑hugid an. K heg am t‑wehhejed e hoꞌigeꞌidahun ab Jiosh wui.
<sax> Who can separate us from Christ's love? Can oppression, distress, or persecution? Or hunger, poverty, danger, or violence? ||| Kuch eda hi wa hebaichujj ab nakog g kudutadag ch s‑hasig haꞌichu ch shoꞌigchudadag nach pi d Christ wohochuddam. Bihugig ch shoꞌigdag ch s‑ta ehbidam haꞌichu ch cheggiadag o ab ep t‑aihog.
<sax> Just as Scripture says, “For your sake we're in danger of being killed all the time. We're treated like sheep to be slaughtered.” ||| Bo chuꞌig g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga:
<sax> I am in Christ, and what I say is true. I'm not lying! My conscience and the Holy Spirit confirm  how terribly sad I am, how I have never-ending pain in my heart, ||| Muꞌijj g ni‑wehm Tutuligo o s‑ohhodamk g Jesus pi wohochudch mo d Jiosh si Kehsha.

<sax> for my own people, my brothers and sisters. I would rather be cursed myself, separated from Christ, if that would help them. ||| Si ani tatchua mat wo e doꞌibia g ni‑wehm oꞌodham, chum anis hems heg hekaj pi wo ni‑doꞌibia.
<sax> They are my fellow-Israelites, God's chosen people. God revealed to them his glory and made agreements with them, giving them the law, true worship, and his promises.  They are our forefathers—ancestors of Christ, humanly-speaking, the One who rules over everything, the eternally-blessed God. Amen. ||| Do chum Jiosh hemajkamga. Jiosh at ab i ha chuhcha g t‑shohshonbad k am ha ahgid mat si s‑kehg haꞌichu hab wo t‑juni. Ab o si has t‑elid g Jiosh ch ab t‑mahkch g e‑chehanig.

<sax> It's not that God's promise has failed. For not every Israelite is a true Israelite, ||| K eda muꞌijj g ni‑wehm oꞌodham pi ab hu wohochud g Jiosh si Kehsha. K wabshaba id pi hab d ahga mas g Jiosh pi am hu hab wo juh hegai mo hab kaij mat hab wo juh. Pi atsh wehsijj g Tutuligo d wo Jiosh hemajkamgak.
<sax> and all those who are descended from Abraham are not his true children. For Scripture says, “Your descendants will be counted through Isaac,” ||| Id ant am wo em‑tashogi am em‑ahgidch ab amjed g Abrahambad. Pi atsh wehsijj g Abrahambad amjedkam wo enigak hegai mash wa g Jiosh ab makiog. Gohk ash wa aꞌalidag g Abrahambad. Sh hema hab chehgig Isaac. Kush g Jiosh hab kaij ab Abrahambad wui:
<sax> So what should we conclude? That God was unjust? Certainly not! ||| Pegih, naꞌams haꞌi hab elid mat pi ap chuꞌi g Jiosh. K wabshaba pi hab chuꞌig
<sax> As he said to Moses, “I will be merciful to whoever I should show mercy, and I will have compassion on whoever I should show compassion.” ||| nash pi hab kaij ab Mosesbad wui:
<sax> Scripture records God saying to Pharaoh: “I put you here for a reason—so that through you I could demonstrate my power, and so that my name could be made known throughout the earth.” ||| An o oꞌohanas mash hab kaij g Jiosh am wui g ha‑kownalig g Egypt t am hemajkam:
<sax> Now you'll argue with me and ask, “So why does he still blame us then? Who can resist the will of God?” ||| Neh, tp hems hema wo kah ihda k hab wo chei, “Pegih, pi at haꞌichu ab hu wo chum t‑abch g Jiosh matp heg hab wa masma hab t‑juh map has i kaij.”
<sax> That's no way to speak, for who are you—a mere mortal—to contradict God? Can something that is created say to its creator, “Why did you make me like this?” ||| Nt wabshaba wo em‑ahgi mo pi ab hu shaꞌi ab g oꞌodham mas ab wui wo neo g Jiosh. Dach Jiosh nahtoi ch pi edgid g apꞌedag machs ab wui hab wo chei mas haschu ahgk hab masma t‑nahto.
<sax> Doesn't a potter have the right to use the same batch of clay to make both a decorative bowl and an everyday pot? ||| Neh, nat hig pi hab wo ha juh g hahaꞌatdam g hab mams hahaꞌa mat wo tatchuad? Hema atp hems d wo s‑kehg haꞌak ch hema d wo pi kehg haꞌak.
<sax> It's as if God, wanting to demonstrate his opposition to sin and to reveal his power, bears patiently with these “pots destined for destruction,” ||| Pegih, t g Jiosh wehs hab ha juh g hemajkam. K haꞌi pi ap d hemajkam. K wabshaba g Jiosh s‑ha bahbgi. T am wo i e ai mat am wo chehgi g e‑gewkdag k wo s‑koꞌokam ha namkid.
<sax> so that he might reveal the greatness of his glory through these “pots of mercy” which he has prepared in advance for glory. ||| Kuch haꞌi s‑ap d hemajkam no pi ab si s‑t‑hoꞌigeꞌid g Jiosh. Am at i t‑apꞌech matt hab masma wo nei g gewkdaj.
<sax> What shall we conclude, then? That even though the foreigners were not even looking to do right, they did grasp what is right, and through their trust in God did what was right. ||| Pegih, pi am wa am hu e gahgid g Jiosh apꞌedag ahpim gawul mahs hemajkam ch wabshaba am i kah ab amjed g Jiosh alidag k ab i s‑wohoch. T g Jiosh am i em‑apꞌech e tahgio gam hu hab i juhk g pi ap em‑chuꞌijig.
<sax> But the people of Israel, who looked to the law to make them right with God, never succeeded. ||| K g ni‑wehm oꞌodham am i chum e apꞌechud g chehanigkaj ch pi bei g e‑apꞌedag
<sax> Why not? Because they relied on what they did rather than trusting in God. They tripped on the stumbling-block, ||| nat pi pi ab hu wohoch g Jiosh k pi ab hu bei g si Kehshaj k wabsh am hab chum s‑junimk g s‑apꞌekam mat hekaj wo s‑apꞌek am Jiosh tahgio. Id o heg wa wepo mat e huchwua ab hodai t ab.
<sax> just as Scripture predicted: “Look, I'm placing in Zion a stumbling-block, a rock that will offend people. But those who trust in him won't be disappointed.” ||| An o hab chuꞌig Jiosh oꞌohana ed mo hab kaij g Jiosh:
<sax> My brothers and sisters, my heart's desire—my prayer to God—is for the salvation of the people of Israel! ||| Ni‑wepnag, chum ani si tatchua mat hu wo i e doꞌibia g ni‑wehm oꞌodham ch heg hekaj am ni‑hoꞌigeꞌidahun Jiosh wui.
<sax> I can testify to their passionate dedication to God, but it's not based on knowing him as he truly is. ||| Hegam o tatchua mat am wo i e apꞌech Jiosh tahgio ch wabshaba pi ap mahch mas has masma hab wo e juh.
<sax> They don't understand how God makes us right with him, and they try to make themselves right. They refuse to accept God's way of making people right. ||| Jiosh at am i apꞌech matt has masma wo s‑apꞌek am tahgio. K g ni‑wehm oꞌodham wabsh s‑ohhodamk g apchudaj ch wabsh hejel am chum s‑e apchudamk
<sax> For Christ is the fulfillment of the law. All those who trust in him are made right. ||| ab s‑wohog elidch g Jiosh chehanig. K wabshaba g Jiosh am t‑chehgidch matt ab wabsh wo i s‑wohoch g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj k ab wo i hiwigi g Christ. T heg am wo i t‑apꞌech am tahgio.
<sax> As Scripture says, “Those who trust in him will not be disappointed.” ||| Bo chuꞌig g Jiosh oꞌohana:
<sax> For “everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.” ||| Bo chuꞌig g Jiosh oꞌohana:
<sax> Then Isaiah said it even more strongly: “I was found by people who weren't even looking for me; I revealed myself to people who weren't even asking for me.” ||| Tki g Isaiabad an oꞌoha mash s‑gewkam hab kaij g Jiosh:
<sax> But then I ask, “Has God rejected his people?” Of course not! I'm an Israelite myself, from the tribe of Benjamin. ||| Pegih, naꞌas hab sha elidas mat gam hu s‑ha ohhod g Jiosh g Tutuligo mat pi d haha wo hemajkamgajk. K wabshaba pi hab mahs. Ahni ani hab waꞌap d Tuhligo. T g Jiosh pi gam hu ni‑ohhod. Benjaminbad o d si ni‑shohshon ch heg d amjedkamaj g Abrahambad.
<sax> God has not rejected his chosen people. Don't you recall what Scripture says about Elijah? How he complained about Israel to God, saying, ||| Pi at gam hu s‑t‑ohhod g Jiosh. Dach chum hemajkamgaj. Heki at hu ab i ha gawulkai g t‑shohshon.
<sax> How did God answer him? “I still have seven thousand left who have not worshiped Baal.” ||| Sh wabshaba hab kaij g Jiosh ab wui:
<sax> So what do we conclude? That the people of Israel didn't achieve what they were striving for—only the chosen, while the rest became hard-hearted. ||| Pegih, al heꞌekia at ab i ha gawulkai g Jiosh g ni‑wehm oꞌodham. T idam cheh g e‑gahgi. Muꞌijj at pi cheh no pi pi chechkaidag ab Jiosh wui.
<sax> As Scripture says, “God dulled their minds so their eyes could not see and their ears could not hear, to this very day.” ||| K hab chuꞌig g Jiosh oꞌohana:
<sax> Now let me speak to you foreigners. Insofar as I'm a missionary to foreigners, I promote what I'm doing ||| Dani kehshaj g Jesus Christ mant wo em‑ahgi ahpim gawul mahs hemajkam g haꞌichu ahgaj. Kunt wo si haꞌichuch ihda ni‑chikpan.
<sax> that somehow I might make my people jealous and save some of them. ||| Tp hems g ni‑wehm oꞌodham wo s‑em‑hehgam k haꞌijj wo e doꞌibia.
<sax> If the result of God's rejection of them is that the world becomes God's friends, the result of God's acceptance of them would be like the dead coming back to life! ||| Jiosh at ab i kuhpiꞌo g apꞌedag am ha wehhejed g gawul mahs hemajkam mat hekid gam hu hab i ha juh g Tutuligo. T g gawul mahs hemajkam baꞌich wo i bei g hoꞌigeꞌidadag mat hekid am wo i e ai g tash mat g Tutuligo ab wo i e nohnogi Jiosh wui. Kut woho ab wo i e nohnogi wui.
<sax> If the first part of the bread dough given as an offering is holy, then so is all the rest; if the roots of a tree are holy, then so are the branches. ||| Neh, ab ach mamka g Jiosh g wehpegkamaj g haꞌichu t‑gehgewa ch hab masma chehgid mo wehs d enigaj hegai t‑gehgewa. Pegih, t‑shohshon ahchim Tutuligo o d wehpegkam. K d si shel mat g ha‑amjedkam muꞌi ab wo i e nohnogi Jiosh wui. Uhs mahmhadag o d Jiosh eniga mamtp ab wo mah g tatkaj. T‑shohshon o d tatk. Ch ahchim d mahmhadgaj.
<sax> Now if some of the branches have been broken off, and you—a wild olive shoot—have been grafted in, and have shared with them the benefit of nourishment from the olive tree's roots, ||| Mt wabshaba wo hikkumiꞌa hegam mahmhadgaj mat pi ab hu wo bahidagt k ab wo ha namki ab hegam mat wo s‑kehg bahidagt. Pegih, t g Jiosh hab masma gam hu hab i ha juh hegam Tutuligo mo pi ab hu wohochud k ahpim em‑ui gawul mahs hemajkam mamt ab i s‑wohoch. Kum ab hahawa wehs apꞌedag hegai mo haschu d i chum ha‑apꞌedag hegam Tutuligo mo pi ab hu wohochud.
<sax> then you shouldn't look down on the other branches. If you're tempted to boast, remember it's not you who are supporting the roots, but the roots that are supporting you. ||| Mt pi wo e haschudad mat gam hu hab i ha juh. Jiosh at hab em‑juh mamt hab haha wo masmak mam d Abrahambad amjedkam. Pi am d ha‑shohshon ch wabsh heg wa wepo mam d mahmhadag.
<sax> You could make the claim, “Branches were broken off so I could be grafted in.” ||| Mtp hems hab wo chei mat g mahmhadgaj e hikkumiꞌa mat am wo em‑jegel.
<sax> All well and good—but they were broken off because of their failure to trust in God, and you stay there because you trust in God. So don't think highly of yourselves, but be respectful, ||| T wabshaba hab wa e juh nat pi pi ab hu wohoch g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. Mt ahpim ab s‑wohochud k hekaj ab giꞌis shonaj ab. Mt wabshaba pi wo si e haschudad id hekaj.
<sax> If they no longer refuse to trust in God, they can be grafted in as well, for God is able to graft them back in again. ||| Jiosh at ab uhpam ep wo ha ui hegam Tutuligo mat ab wo i s‑wohoch.
<sax> If you could be cut from a wild olive tree, and then be grafted artificially onto a cultivated olive tree, how much more easily they could be grafted back naturally to their own tree. ||| Ab at em‑ui ahpim gawul mahs oꞌodham. Kum wa chum pi e nahtokch. Id o wepo masma mamt wabsh chum hebai wo ha mul g iꞌibhonig k ab wo namki g uhs e‑eꞌes. Tutuligo o chum e nahtokch. T g Jiosh ab uhpam ep wo ha ui hegam mat ab wo i s‑wohoch. Id o wepo masma mamt ab uhpam ep wo ha namki g ha‑iꞌibhonig am i ha mulink.
<sax> I don't want you, my brothers and sisters to miss this previously-hidden truth, for otherwise you could become conceited. The people of Israel have become hard-hearted in part, until the process of the foreigners coming in is complete. ||| Neh, ni‑wepnag, hemu at haꞌichu mahsko wua g Jiosh. Kuni id s‑em‑ahgidamk.

<sax> This is how all Israel will be saved.  As Scripture says, “The Savior will come from Zion, and he will turn Jacob away from his opposition to God. ||| T haha wo e doꞌibia g Tutuligo. An o oꞌohadag mo hab kaij g Jiosh:
<sax> Though they are enemies of the good news—and this is to your benefit—they are still the chosen people, and loved because of their forefathers. ||| Ahchim Tutuligo ach d chum Jiosh hemajkamga nat pi ab i ha gawulkai g t‑shohshon.

<sax> God's gifts and his calling can't be withdrawn. ||| Pi at hekid am gawul wo juh g e‑chegitoi g Jiosh.
<sax> At one time you disobeyed God, but now God has shown you mercy as a result of their disobedience. ||| Ahpim gawul mahs hemajkam am wa pi ab hu wohog elid g Jiosh.

<sax> In just the same way that they're now disobedient as you were, they will also be shown mercy like you received. ||| K wabshaba ab him g tash mat hahawa em‑wepo masma wo bei g Jiosh hoꞌigeꞌidadag g Tutuligo.
<sax> Who can know God's thoughts? Who can give him advice? ||| Neh, bo chuꞌig an Jiosh oꞌohana ed:
<sax> So I encourage you, my brothers and sisters, because of God's compassion for you, to dedicate your bodies as a living offering that is holy and pleasing to God. This is the logical way to worship. ||| Pegih neh, ni‑wepnag, si o s‑t‑hoꞌigeꞌid g Jiosh. Tt heg hekaj wehs am wo i t‑dagito wui matt am wehhejed d wo dodakamk ch am hab wo junihid g tatchuij.

<sax> Let me explain to all of you, through the grace given to me, that no one should think of themselves better than they ought to. You should think about yourselves realistically, according to the degree of trust God has shared with you. ||| Jiosh o ab s‑ni‑hoꞌigeꞌid ch ab ni‑mah g gewkdag.

<sax> Just as there are many parts to the body, but they don't all do the same thing, ||| Neh, no hig pi woho nahnko haꞌichu hab wua g oꞌodham chuhchuꞌidag, chum as d hemako g honshpadaj.
<sax> so we are one body in Christ, even though we are many—and we all belong to one another. ||| Pegih, tt hab wa masma nahnko haꞌichu wo junihid mat aꞌai d wo i t‑wehmtadagk ahchim mach ab t‑hemakochudch g Christ wehm.
<sax> We each have different gifts that vary according to the grace given to us. So if it's speaking for God, then you should do so depending on how much you trust in God. ||| Am g wo hekaj g e‑gewkdag aꞌai e wehhejed hab masma mo g Jiosh am apꞌechudch mamt hab wo e juh. Haꞌi o ab em‑mahkch g gewkdag mamt am wo ahgahid g haꞌichu ahgaj. Kumt ab wo s‑wohochudad ch wo ahgahid.
<sax> If it's the ministry of service then you should serve; if teaching then you should teach; ||| Haꞌi o d em‑mahkigdag mamt haꞌichukaj wo i ha wehmtad g e‑wehm wohochuddam o wo haꞌichu ha mashchamad
<sax> Be completely dedicated to each other in your love as family; value others more than yourselves. ||| Ab g wo si ha tatchuad g e‑wehm wohochuddam ch ab has wo ha elidad, chum as aigo pi ab hu has wo em‑elidad.
<sax> Don't be unwilling to work hard; serve the Lord with an enthusiastic spirit. ||| Mt wo si chikpanad ch pi wo papadmak. Si e‑ihbdagkaj amt ab wo ihmad g Christ ch wo chikpandad.
<sax> Remain cheerful in the hope you have, put up with the troubles that come, keep on praying. ||| Mt wo si s‑hehgigk heg hekaj mo haschu g Jiosh ab em‑wuichud. Am g wabsh wo i s‑dodolimak e‑kudutadag ed ch chum hekid wo e hoꞌigeꞌidahunad.

<sax> Be happy with those who are happy; cry with those who are crying. ||| Ab g wo si ha wehm s‑hehgigk hegam mo s‑hehgig ch ha wehm pi ap e tahtk hegam mo pi ap e tahtk.
<sax> Think about one another.  Don't consider yourself more important than others; live humbly. Don't be conceited. ||| Am g wabsh s‑ap e wehm wo kihkad.

<sax> Everyone should obey government authorities, because no one has the power to rule unless God gives permission. These authorities have been put there by God. ||| Am o apꞌechudch g Jiosh mat in wo haꞌichugk g kownaltalig ch am wo t‑dahmk. Tt heg hekaj ab wo wechok g ha‑chehanig g kokownal

<sax> For rulers don't frighten those who do right, but those who do wrong. If you don't want to live in fear of the authorities, then do what is right, and you'll have their approval. ||| Tt heg hekaj wo s‑ehbidad g kownal matt hab wo sha junihid g pi apꞌekam ch wabshaba pi wo ehbidad mattp g s‑apꞌekam hab wo junihid. Am g hab wo waꞌi junihid g s‑apꞌekam. T g hahaꞌichu s‑ap wo em‑elidad.
<sax> Those in power are God's servants, put there for your own good. If you do wrong, you should be frightened—it's not without reason that authorities have the power to punish! They are God's servants, punishing offenders. ||| Jiosh at am i ha chuhcha g kokownal mat wo t‑nuhkudad. Kut wo s‑ta ehbidamk mattp hab wo junihid g pi apꞌekam no pi g Jiosh ab ha mahkch g gewkdag mat s‑koꞌokam wo t‑namkid.
<sax> So it's important to do as you're told, not just because of the threat of punishment, but because of what your conscience tells you. ||| Hemho wa att wo himad g chehanig nach pi s‑mahch mo pi apꞌe matt wo melchkwua.
<sax> That's why you have to pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants taking care of such things. ||| Ab o d wuikamaj g kownal hegai mo haschu ab t‑kowlant mat hekaj wo himad g e‑chikpan.
<sax> Pay whatever you owe: taxes to the tax authorities, fees to the fee-collectors; give respect to those who should be respected, honor those who should be honored. ||| Pegih, tt ab has wo ha elidad g hahaꞌichu k wo namkidad g kownal hegai mo haschu ab t‑chehani.
<sax> Don't owe anybody anything, except love for one another—for those who love their neighbor have kept the law. ||| Pi att hedai wui wo chum t‑wulshchid ch wabsh s‑ap wo ha namkidad. Id att waꞌi hekaj wo chum t‑wulshchid matt ab aꞌai t‑hekaj wo si pihk t‑elidad. Id o d Jiosh chehanig. Kuch ab s‑wohog elid g chehanigaj ab aꞌai si pihk t‑elidch.
<sax> The night is nearly over, the day is almost here! So let's get rid of our dark deeds and put on the armor of light. ||| Pegih, tt wo dagito g pi apꞌekam k g s‑apꞌekam am hab wo junihid. E o aihim matt s‑ap wo t‑doꞌibia.
<sax> Let's behave properly, showing that we're people who are living in the light. We shouldn't spend our time going to wild parties and getting drunk, or having affairs and acting immorally, or getting into fights and being jealous. ||| Tt wo si t‑elidad mattp wo ihꞌed ch wo t‑nondagch o attp wabsh chum hedai wehm wo woꞌiwup o attp s‑uam has wo t‑wuad o attp wo s‑ha hehgam o attp wo ha cheggia. Ab o t‑ab matt am wo dagito hewai hab mahs haꞌichu k heg hab wo waꞌi junihid mo d s‑apꞌekam.
<sax> Instead put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and forget about following your sinful desires. ||| Do si t‑kownalig g Jesus Christ. Kutt ab wui wo i t‑dagito matt pi am hu hab wo junihid g pi ap t‑tatchui.
<sax> Accept those who are still struggling to trust in God, and don't get into arguments over personal opinions. ||| Haꞌi atp hems am wabsh kia pi gewpkdag g em‑wehm wohochuddam am e‑wohochudadag ed. Kumt wabsh wo ha tatchuad ch pi wo neꞌowi heg amjed mo haschu al i s‑mahch.
<sax> One person may believe they can eat anything, while another whose trust is weak only eats vegetables. ||| Neh, am o wa s‑apꞌe matt wabsh chum haschu hugi wo koꞌad matp wo s‑gewkdagk g t‑wohochudadag. K wabshaba haꞌi pi gewkdag e‑wohochudadag ed ch heg hekaj hab e elid mo haꞌichu pi hiwgidas mat wo e koꞌad.
<sax> Those who eat anything must not look down on those who won't, and those who won't eat must not criticize those who do—for God has accepted them both. ||| Kutt pi aꞌai has wo t‑ehꞌel heg hekaj mach haschu i koꞌa nat pi g Jiosh ab i t‑ui.
<sax> What right do you have to judge someone else's servant? It's their own master who decides whether they are right or wrong. With the Lord's help they will be able to take their stand for right. ||| Pi o ab hu t‑ab machs wo has ahgad g t‑wehm wohochuddam. Do Jiosh pionag. Jiosh o d t‑ahmo ch heg am wo i aꞌappe mas s‑ap am hab e junihim g t‑wehm wohochuddam. T wabsh wo e nako mat s‑ap am hab wo junihid no pi g Jiosh am i wehmaj wehs haꞌichu k ed.
<sax> Some people consider some days more important than others, while others consider each day the same. Everyone should be completely convinced in their own minds. ||| Haꞌi o hab e elid mat am wo oidad g Tutuligo ha‑pipiast tash ch haꞌi hab elid mo wehs tash am wabsh i e wepodag. Ab o hejel t‑ab mattp has wo i elidad.
<sax> If we live, we live for the Lord, or if we die, we die for the Lord—so whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord. ||| Pegih, dach Christ hemajkamga mach in d doakam ch hab waꞌap d enigaj chum achs hems wo muh.
<sax> This was the reason Christ died and came back to life—so that he could be the Lord of both the dead and the living. ||| Christ at muh k ab uhpam i wuhsh muhkig amjed mat d wo t‑kownaligk, chum achs hems wo muh.
<sax> So why do you criticize your fellow-believer? Why do you despise your fellow-believer? For all of us will stand before God's throne of judgment. ||| Pegih, pi att am wo chum has ahgad g t‑wehm wohochuddam. Wehsijj att am wo i gegokiwua wui g Jiosh heg i eda lodaita tash.
<sax> For the Scriptures say, “ ‘As surely as I am alive,’ the Lord says, ‘Every knee shall bow before me, and every tongue will declare that I am God.’ ” ||| Neh, an o oꞌohadag mo hab kaij g Jiosh:
<sax> Therefore let's not judge each other anymore, but decide to do this instead—we won't put obstacles in the way of fellow-believers, or cause them to fall. ||| Pegih, mt hig wo haꞌasa aꞌai has e ahgad. Id amt am hab wo elidad mamt pi am hu wabsh has wo e wuad. T hekaj pi wo heki hih g em‑wehm wohochuddam o am wo gei pi apꞌekam ch ed.
<sax> I'm certain—persuaded by the Lord Jesus—that nothing in itself is ceremonially unclean. But if someone considers it to be unclean, to them it is unclean. ||| Ab ach s‑wohochud g t‑kownalig Jesus ch hekaj chum s‑mahch mo wehs g haꞌichu hugi hiwgidas matt wo huh. Tp wabshaba hema hab wo elidad mo pi hiwgidas, pegih, k pi apꞌe mas an wo bei.
<sax> If your fellow-believer is hurt by you over matters of food, then you're no longer behaving in a loving way. Don't destroy someone for whom Christ died by the food you choose to eat. ||| Kutp hems wo heki him k pi wo e doꞌibia matp hema an wo hekaj hegai mo haschu hab elid mo pi hiwgidas. Pi ach tatchua g t‑wehm wohochuddam mattp wo heki himch. T eda g Christ wehhejed muh chum s‑doꞌibiamk.
<sax> Don't let the good things you do be misrepresented— ||| Pi g am hu haꞌichu has wo juhni mamt heg hekaj wo has em‑ahgad, chum ams hems hab elid mo d s‑apꞌekam.
<sax> So let's pursue the path of peace, and find ways to encourage each other. ||| Tt heg wui am wo i t‑nako matt haschukaj ab aꞌai wo i t‑gewkemhunad ch ab aꞌai t‑wui wo s‑ap t‑tahtkk.
<sax> Don't destroy the work of God with arguments over food. Everything is clean—but it would be wrong to eat and offend others. ||| Do Jiosh doꞌibiakam g t‑wehm wohochuddam. Pegih, pi g haꞌichu hab wo juhni mas hekaj wo heki hihi. Wehs haꞌichu hugi o hiwgidas. K wabshaba pi apꞌe machs wo koꞌad matt haschukaj wo ha heki hihimch g t‑wehm wohochuddam.
<sax> It's better not to eat meat or drink wine or anything else that would cause your fellow-believer to stumble. ||| Kutt heg hekaj wabsh wo dagito hegai mattp haschukaj wo heki himch g t‑wehm wohochuddam. Chuhkug attp hems wo dagito o g nawait o wabsh chum haschu.
<sax> What you personally believe is between you and God. Happy are those who don't condemn themselves for doing what they think is right! ||| Am att wabsh wo hejel nuhkudad mach haschu i s‑wohochud id amjed ch heg waꞌi Jiosh ab wo ahgi. Tt wo s‑hehgigk mattp hab wo junihid hegai mach haschu i s‑mahch mo s‑apꞌe. T hab pi wo heki hih g t‑wehm wohochuddam.
<sax> But if you have doubts whether it's right or wrong to eat something, then you shouldn't, because you're not convinced it's right. Whatever isn't based on conviction  is sin. ||| Pi g am hu hab wo juhni hegai mam haschu pi mahch mas d s‑apꞌekam k hab pi ab hu wo e chuꞌijigch heg hekaj.
<sax> Those of us who are spiritually strong ought to support those who are spiritually weak. We shouldn't just please ourselves. ||| Pi att wabsh hejel am wo t‑chegitod ahchim mach ab wabsh s‑ap s‑wohochud g Jiosh ch wabshaba ep wo ha chegitod hegam mo pi am hu i si s‑amichud mo haꞌichu s‑apꞌe.
<sax> We should all encourage others to do what's right, building them up. ||| Kut heg hekaj ab wo i e gewkemhunad ch baꞌich wo i s‑ap s‑amich mo haschu s‑apꞌe.
<sax> Christ didn't live to please himself, but as Scripture says of him, “The insults of those who abused you have fallen on me.” ||| Am o t‑chehgidch g Christ matt pi wabsh hejel wo t‑chegitok no pi pi wabsh hejel am hu e chegito mo wa in oimmed. An at oꞌoha g kelibad Jiosh haꞌichu i tashogiddam:
<sax> I maintain that Christ came as a servant to the Jews  to show God tells the truth, keeping the promises he made to their forefathers. ||| Chum o hekid am hab junihim g Jiosh mo has i kaij. T heg hekaj ia jiwia g Christ mat am hab wo t‑juni ahchim Tutuligo hegai moki haschu g Jiosh ab ha ahgid g t‑shohshonbad.
<sax> He also came that foreigners could praise God for his mercy, as Scripture says, “Therefore I will praise you among the foreigners; I will sing praises to your name.” ||| Kumt heg hekaj ab ep wo ihm g Jiosh ahpim gawul mahs hemajkam mat ab hab waꞌap s‑em hoꞌigeꞌel. Neh, bo chuꞌig an Jiosh oꞌohana ed mo hema hab kaij am Jiosh wui:
<sax> May the God of hope completely fill you with all joy and peace as you trust in him, so that you will overflow with hope through the power of the Holy Spirit! ||| Jiosh at hab em‑juh mamt wabsh wo nenidad matp haschu am hab wo i em‑juni. Kuni ab tahni mat ab wo i gewkai g em‑wohochudadag mamt hekaj wo si s‑hehgigk ch wo si s‑ap e tahtkk ab wui. Bamt masma baꞌich i s‑ap wo nenidad g e‑apꞌedag. T g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag ab baꞌich wo i em‑mah g wohochudadag.
<sax> I'm convinced that you, my brothers and sisters, are full of goodness, and that you are filled with every kind of knowledge, so you are well able to teach one another. ||| Ni‑wepnag, s‑mahch ani mamtp hu hi wa i s‑ap am hab e junihim ch muꞌi haꞌichu s‑mahch mamt s‑ap aꞌai wo e mashcha.
<sax> I've been blunt in the way I have written to you about some of these things, but this is just to remind you. For God gave me grace ||| Ni wabshaba id eda oꞌohana si s‑gewkam haꞌichu am em‑ahgid mant am wo i em‑chegitoich. Jiosh at ab has ni‑elid k am i ni‑kei
<sax> to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the foreigners, like a priest sharing God's good news, so that they could become an acceptable offering, made holy by the Holy Spirit. ||| mant d wo piongajk g Jesus Christ em‑wehhejed ahpim gawul mahs hemajkam. Am ani wehsko ahgachug g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh am ha wui g gawul mahs hemajkam. K heg hekaj ha apꞌechudahim g Hekia S‑apꞌekam Gewkdag. K ab ihm g Jiosh idam.
<sax> So even though I have something to boast about because of my service for God, ||| Kuni si s‑ap ni‑tahtk ch chikpanid g Jiosh ahgachugch g haꞌichu ahgaj ab amjed g Jesus Christ.
<sax> (I wouldn't dare talk about any of this except as Christ has done it through me), I have led foreigners to obedience through my teaching and demonstration, ||| Heg at am hab ha juh g gawul mahs hemajkam mat ab s‑wohog el g Jiosh heg hekaj mani has i kaij ch has ni‑wua. Kuni heg waꞌi s‑em‑ahgidamk mat heg has e juh.
<sax> As Scripture says, “Those who haven't been told the good news will discover him, and those who haven't heard will understand.” ||| Neh, bo d ahga ihda Jiosh oꞌohana mo hab chuꞌig:
<sax> But now, as there's nowhere left here to work, and since I've looked forward to visiting you for many years, ||| K wabshaba hemu pi am hu ha wiꞌis manis am hu wo ahgachugad g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga am ha oidch idam jejewed. Muꞌi aꞌahidag ani am chum s‑em‑chehgimelimk
<sax> when I go to Spain I hope to see you when I pass through. Maybe you can give me some help for my journey once we've enjoyed some time together. ||| ch antp huꞌi haha wo ni‑nako hemuch am himadch Spain jewed wui nani pi am s‑himimk. S‑mahch ani hi wa mamt am wo i ni‑wehmt mant am wo him k am heꞌes wo i em‑neidchkahim ch s‑ap wo ni‑tahtkk.
<sax> At the moment I'm on my way to Jerusalem to help the believers there, ||| Nt wabshaba wehpeg gam hu wo hih Jerusalem wui k am haꞌichukaj wo i ha wehmt g t‑wehm wohochuddam amai.
<sax> because the believers in Macedonia and Achaia thought it was a good idea to send a contribution to the poor among the believers in Jerusalem. ||| Si ash e shoꞌigchud g t‑wehm wohochuddam Jerusalem t am. T hegam t‑wehm wohochuddam mo am kih Macedonia ch Greece jejewed ch ed hab i e ah mat wo i hemapai g lial k hekaj wo i ha wehmt.
<sax> They were happy to do this because they're in their debt.  Now that foreigners are sharing their spiritual benefits, they owe it to the Jewish believers to help them in material things. ||| S‑apꞌe o mat am aigo wo i ha wehmt nat pi ab ha amjed i hih g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahgaj g Jiosh.
<sax> So once I've done this, and have safely delivered this contribution to them, I'll visit you on my way to Spain. ||| Neh, am ant ha wehm wo hih hegam mat am wo i ui g ha‑mahkigdag Jerusalem t am. Heg i dahm ant am haha wo i em‑chehgim am himadch mant gam hu wo hih Spain wui.
<sax> I know that when I come, Christ will give us his full blessing. ||| S‑mahch ani matt ab aꞌai wo si s‑t‑hoꞌigeꞌel mant am wo jiwia em‑wui.
<sax> Pray that I will come to you with gladness, as God wills, so we can enjoy one another's company. ||| Nt heg hekaj si s‑ap ni‑tahtk k am wo i em‑chehgim matp hab wo elidad g Jiosh.
<sax> May the God of peace be with you all. Amen. ||| Jiosh o ab t‑mahkch g s‑ap tahhadkam. Ni ab tahni mat ab baꞌich wo i em‑wehmt.
<sax> I recommend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a deaconess at the Cenchreae church. ||| Am atsh wo i em‑chehgim ihda t‑wehm wohochuddam mo hab chehgig Phebe ch am i ha wehmt g t‑wehm wohochuddam Cenchrea kihhim t am.
<sax> Please welcome her in the Lord, as believers should, and help her in whatever way she needs, because she has been a great help to many people, myself included. ||| Mt s‑ap ab wo i nei am wehhejed g t‑kownalig Jesus.

<sax> Please also give my greetings to the church that meets in their home. Pass on my best wishes to my good friend Epaenetus, the first person to follow Christ in the province of Asia. ||| Kah ani mash am haꞌi e hehemapad ch e mihshmad ha‑kih am idam Priscilla ch Aquila. Kumt am wo ha ahgi mat ab wo i s‑ni‑hoꞌigeꞌel.
<sax> Give my greetings to Mary, who worked hard for you, ||| Sh am si i em‑wehmt g ni‑machiga Mary. Kumt am wo ahgi mat ab wo i s‑ni‑hoꞌigeꞌel.

However I want you to be wise about what's good, and innocent of anything bad. ||| Kumsh eda ahpim ab si s‑wohog elid g s‑kehg haꞌichu ahga ab amjed g Christ.

<sax> Tertius—who wrote down this letter—also sends you greetings in the Lord. ||| Ia o ni‑wehhejed em‑oꞌohanid ihda g Tershus ch hab ep kaij mamtsh ab wo i s‑hoꞌigeꞌel.
<sax> My host Gaius, and the whole church here, send you greetings. Erastus the city treasurer, sends his best wishes, as does our fellow-believer Quartus. ||| Ia ani da kihj am g Gaius.

<sax> but which at the proper time he revealed through his word in the message which I was entrusted to give, following the command of God our Savior. ||| T hemu am i e ai mat s-ap maskogi g haꞌichu e-ahga.
<sax> An elder must have a good reputation, the husband of one wife, and have children who believe and who are not accused of being wild or disobedient. ||| Dat wo si s-ap oꞌodhamk ch hemako wo hohnigk ch pi wo ha chuꞌijigk. T g ha-aꞌaliga hemho wa d wo wohochuddamk ch ab wo ha kaihamad g e-geꞌegedga. T hab pi hedai wo e nako mas ab wo haꞌichu ha abch.
<sax> As a leader for God, a head elder must have a good reputation and not be arrogant. He should not have a quick temper nor get drunk; he shouldn't be violent or greedy for money. ||| Pi o hab chuꞌig mas g ha wanimeddam wo ge e haschudad o s-hohtam wo babgatad o wo nawkkoꞌod o wo ha cheggiad o muꞌi haꞌichu wo si s-behimkkad.
<sax> He should be hospitable, someone who loves what's good and does what's right. He should be living a life for God, self-controlled, ||| K wabshaba hab chuꞌig mat wo s-dodolimak ch hab wo junihid g s-apꞌekam ch chum hekid wo i ha wehmajk hegam mo tatchua g i wehmtadag.
<sax> and must be devoted to the trustworthy message as it's taught. In this way he can encourage others through correct teaching, and be able to convince those who disagree. ||| Am ap ha mashcham g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga. Kut id an wo si uꞌukchid mat heg hekaj wo i ha gewkemhunad g hemajkam ch wo i ha shohbidad hegam mo ab wui gegok g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.
<sax> For there are many rebels around who talk a lot of deceptive nonsense, especially from the circumcision group.  Their talking must stop, these people who throw whole families into turmoil, teaching things that aren't right for the sake of making money. ||| Heki at hu muꞌi i wuwha hegam mo chum s-keshwuimk g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch ha iattogid g hemajkam ch heg hekaj ab ha wanchkwup mat wo ui g lial, wahm hegam mo d ni-wepo Tutuligo oꞌodham. Kumt heg hekaj wehs e wehm am wo i ha shohbi.
<sax> As someone of their own people, a prophet, has stated, “Cretans are always liars, evil beasts who are lazy, greedy people.” ||| Hema ash hab kaij g s-chu amichuddam am Crete t am, “Ahchim Crete t am oꞌodham ach s-chu iꞌattomk ch s-ta kekeꞌidama ch s-papadma ch wehs haꞌichu si s-behimk.”
<sax> This is a true statement! Consequently give them a good telling-off so that they can have a healthy trust in God, ||| Woho o wa mo has i kaij. Kupt heg hekaj si s-gewkam wo i ha shohbi. T hab ab wo m-kaiham k ab wo s-wohochudad g wohokam.
<sax> not paying attention to Jewish myths and human commandments from those who deviate from the truth. ||| Pt wo ha ahgi mat pi wo wohochudad g Tutuligo ha-hohoꞌoki aꞌagida ch hegai mo d wabsh ha-chehanig hegam mo pi tatchua g wohokam.
<sax> You however must teach what is consistent with healthy beliefs. ||| Kupt wabshaba ahpi am wo ha mashcha g wohochuddam mat has wo e junihid ch hekaj wo e chehgidad mo s-kehgaj g Jiosh mashchamadag.
<sax> Older men shouldn't drink; they should be respectable and sensible, with a healthy trust in God, loving and patient. ||| Pt wo ha ahgi g kekel oꞌodham mat d wo si oꞌodhamk ch pi wabsh wo i e wahmud k wabshaba wabsh wo i e bahbgi wehs haꞌichu k ed. T wabsh shelinim wo oidad g e-wohochudadag ch wo pihk e elidad ab wehs ha wui ch s-e tahtk ch ab wo nakogad haꞌichu.
<sax> Similarly older women ought to behave in a way that shows they live their lives for God. They shouldn't destroy people's reputations by what they say, and they shouldn't be addicted to wine. ||| Kupt hab waꞌap wo ha ahgi g oꞌoki mat wo s-dodolimak ch wo e chehgidch mo am oidch hab e junihim g s-apꞌekam ch pi wo nawkkoꞌod ch pi wo pi kehg neneokad ab hedai k amjed.
<sax> They should be teachers of what's good, teaching the young wives to love their husbands and their children. ||| T g wechij uꞌuwi ab ha amjed wo mai mat has wo chum masmak ch ab wo i ha tatchuad g e-wehm kihkam ch e-aꞌaliga
<sax> They are to be sensible and pure, working in their homes, doing good and listening to what their husbands tell them. In this way the word of God will not be spoken about badly. ||| ch wo e nuhkudad mat pi hab wo wuad g pi apꞌekam ch wo si s-wapagimak am e-kihdag ed ch ab wo ha wohog elidad g e-wehm kihkam. T hab pi hedai has wo ahgad g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga.
<sax> Likewise tell the young men to be sensible. ||| Kupt hab waꞌap wo ha ahgi g wihpiop mat d wo si oꞌodhamk.
<sax> You should set an example of doing good in all areas of life: show integrity and seriousness in what you teach, ||| Chum apt hekid hab wo wuad g s-apꞌekam ch hab masma wo ha chehgi mat has wo chum e junihid.
<sax> sharing healthy beliefs that can't be criticized. In this way those who are opposed will be ashamed of themselves and won't have anything bad to say about us. ||| Kupt ab wo si has elidad g wohokam ab amjed g Jiosh ch heg wo waꞌi ha mashchamad. T hab wo si e elidad hegam mo ab wui gegok g Jiosh haꞌichu ahga ch pi wo e nako mas has wo m-ahgad.
<sax> For God's grace has been revealed, bringing salvation to everyone. ||| Jiosh o wehs s-ha hoꞌigeꞌid g hemajkam ch hab juh g doꞌibiadag chum wehs ha wehhejed. T id am wabsh s-ap i e chehgi.
<sax> It teaches us to reject a godless way of life with the desires of this world. Instead we should live thoughtful, self-controlled lives that are right before God in the present world ||| Kutt heg hekaj wo s-ohhod g pi apꞌekam k wo t-nuhkud matt hab wo wuad g s-apꞌekam ch ab wo si haꞌichuch g Jiosh id eda jewed.
<sax> as we look for the wonderful hope of the glorious appearing of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ. ||| Batt wo masmak nach pi nenida mach haschu s-wohochud mat ia ep wo jiwia k si s-tondam wo e chehgi hegai mo d t-Jioshga ch d t-doꞌibiakam Jesus Christ.
<sax> He gave himself for us, so that he could set us free from all our wickedness, and to make us clean for him—a people who belong to him, keen to do good. ||| Heg at am i e dagito mat s-koꞌokam e muhkid k hekaj t-doꞌibia ab amjed g pi apꞌekam k i t-kegch mach d hahawa si hemajkamgaj k si tatchua matt hab wo junihid g s-apꞌekam.
<sax> This is what you should be teaching. You have the authority to encourage and to correct as necessary.

<sax> They should not speak badly about anyone, and they should not be argumentative. Tell them to show gentleness and kindness to everyone. ||| Am g ha ahgid mat pi wo pi kehg neneokad ab hedai i amjed ch wabshaba wo si s-ap e tahtkkad ch wo si s-hemajimak ab wehs ha wui.
<sax> For there was a time when we too were foolish and disobedient. We were deceived and slaves to various desires and pleasures.

<sax> Avoid pointless discussions, and obsessions about ancestry.
